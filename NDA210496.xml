Encorafenib was not genotoxic in studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells, or micronuclei in bone marrow of rats. No dedicated fertility studies were performed with encorafenib in animals. In a general toxicology study in rats, decreased testes and epididymis weights, tubular degeneration in testes, and oligospermia in epididymides were observed at doses approximately 13 times the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose based on AUC. No effects on reproductive organs were observed in either sex in any of the non-human primate toxicity studies. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Adverse histopathology findings of hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis occurred in the stomach of rats at encorafenib doses of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 14 times the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose based on AUC) or greater, in both 4 and 13-week studies."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Encorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF V600E, as well as wild-type BRAF and CRAF in in vitro cell-free assays with IC50 values of 0.35, 0.47, and 0.3 nM, respectively. Mutations in the BRAF gene, such as BRAF V600E, can result in constitutively activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth. Encorafenib was also able to bind to other kinases in vitro including JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, LIMK1, LIMK2, MEK4, and STK36 and substantially reduce ligand binding to these kinases at clinically achievable concentrations (≤ 0.9 µM). Encorafenib inhibited in vitro growth of tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600 E, D, and K mutations. In mice implanted with tumor cells expressing BRAF V600E, encorafenib induced tumor regressions associated with RAF/MEK/ERK pathway suppression. Encorafenib and binimetinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared with either drug alone, co-administration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive cell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Additionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumors, including advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma harboring a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. After a single dose, systemic exposure of encorafenib was dose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 700 mg. After once-daily dosing, systemic exposure of encorafenib was less than dose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 800 mg. Steady-state was reached within 15 days, with exposure being 50% lower compared to Day 1; intersubject variability (CV%) of AUC ranged from 12% to 69%. Absorption After oral administration, the median Tmax of encorafenib is 2 hours. At least 86% of the dose is absorbed. Effect of Food Administration of a single dose of BRAFTOVI 100 mg (0.2 times the recommended dose) with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (comprised of approximately 150 calories from protein, 350 calories from carbohydrates, and 500 calories from fat) decreased the mean maximum encorafenib concentration (Cmax) by 36% with no effect on AUC. Distribution Encorafenib is 86% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.58. The geometric mean (CV%) of apparent volume of distribution is 164 L (70%). Elimination The mean (CV%) terminal half-life (t1/2) of encorafenib is 3.5 hours (17%), and the apparent clearance is 14 L/h (54%) at day 1, increasing to 32 L/h (59%) at steady-state. Metabolism The primary metabolic pathway is N-dealkylation, with CYP3A4 as the main contributor (83%) to total oxidative clearance of encorafenib in human liver microsomes, followed by CYP2C19 (16%) and CYP2D6 (1%). Excretion Following a single oral dose of 100 mg radiolabeled encorafenib, 47% (5% unchanged) of the administered dose was recovered in the feces and 47% (2% unchanged) was recovered in the urine. Specific Populations Age (19 to 89 years), sex, body weight, mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), and mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to < 90 mL/min) do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib. The effect of race or ethnicity, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), and severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) on encorafenib pharmacokinetics have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Encorafenib: Coadministration of a strong (posaconazole) or moderate (diltiazem) CYP3A4 inhibitor with BRAFTOVI increased the AUC of encorafenib by 3- and 2-fold, respectively, and increased the Cmax by 68% and 45%, respectively, after a single BRAFTOVI dose of 50 mg (0.1 times the recommended dose). Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers on Encorafenib: The effect of coadministration of a CYP3A4 inducer on encorafenib exposure has not been studied. In clinical trials, steady-state encorafenib exposures were lower than encorafenib exposures after the first dose, suggesting CYP3A4 auto-induction. Effect of Acid Reducing Agents on Encorafenib: Coadministration of a proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole, had no effect on AUC and Cmax of encorafenib. Combination Treatment: Coadministration of BRAFTOVI (UGT1A1 inhibitor) with binimetinib (UGT1A1 substrate) had no effect on binimetinib exposure. In Vitro Studies Effect of Encorafenib on CYP/UGT Substrates: Encorafenib is a reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A, and a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Encorafenib induced CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Effect of Transporters on Encorafenib: Encorafenib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Encorafenib is not a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) or organic cation transporter (OCT1) at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Effect of Encorafenib on Transporters: Encorafenib inhibited P-gp, BCRP, OCT2, organic anion transporter (OAT1, OAT3), OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OCT1 or MRP2 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available clinical data on the use of BRAFTOVI during pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, encorafenib produced embryo-fetal developmental changes in rats and rabbits and was an abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 26 (in the rat) and 178 (in the rabbit) times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 450 mg, with no clear findings at lower doses (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicity studies, administration of encorafenib to rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal weights, and increased incidence of total skeletal variations at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 26 times the human exposure based on area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] at the recommended clinical dose of 450 mg once daily). In pregnant rabbits, administration of encorafenib during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal body weights, increased incidence of total skeletal variations and increased post-implantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 178 times the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 450 mg once daily). While formal placental transfer studies have not been performed, encorafenib exposure in the fetal plasma of both rats and rabbits was up to 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively, of maternal exposure."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New Primary Malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous: Can occur. Monitor for malignancies and perform dermatologic evaluations prior to, while on therapy, and following discontinuation of treatment. (5.1) Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors: Increased cell proliferation can occur with BRAF inhibitors. (5.2) Hemorrhage: Major hemorrhagic events can occur. (5.3) Uveitis: Perform ophthalmologic evaluation at regular intervals and for any visual disturbances. (5.4) QT Prolongation: Monitor electrolytes before and during treatment. Correct electrolyte abnormalities and control for cardiac risk factors for QT prolongation. Withhold BRAFTOVI for QTc of 500 ms or greater. (5.5) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females with reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus and to use effective non-hormonal method of contraception. (5.6, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 New Primary Malignancies New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, have been observed in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors and can occur with BRAFTOVI. Cutaneous Malignancies In COLUMBUS, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), including keratoacanthoma (KA), occurred in 2.6%, and basal cell carcinoma occurred in 1.6% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Median time to first occurrence of cuSCC/KA was 5.8 months (range 1 to 9 months) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. For patients who received BRAFTOVI as a single agent, cuSCC/KA was reported in 8%, basal cell carcinoma in 1%, and a new primary melanoma in 5% of patients. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies. Non-Cutaneous Malignancies Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells, which are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation prior to initiating BRAFTOVI [see Indications and Usage (1), Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.3 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage can occur when BRAFTOVI is administered in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; Grade 3 or greater hemorrhage occurred in 3.2% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were gastrointestinal, including rectal hemorrhage (4.2%), hematochezia (3.1%), and hemorrhoidal hemorrhage (1%). Fatal intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of new or progressive brain metastases occurred in 1.6% of patients. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.4 Uveitis Uveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, the incidence of uveitis among patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 4%. Assess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform an ophthalmologic evaluation at regular intervals and for new or worsening visual disturbances, and to follow new or persistent ophthalmologic findings. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 QT Prolongation BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In COLUMBUS, an increase in QTcF to > 500 ms was measured in 0.5% (1/192) of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue for QTc > 500 ms [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Encorafenib produced embryo-fetal developmental changes in rats and rabbits and was an abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 26 (in the rat) and 178 (in the rabbit) times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 450 mg, with no clear findings at lower doses. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective, non-hormonal method of contraception since BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment and for 2 weeks after the final dose of BRAFTOVI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.7 Risks Associated with BRAFTOVI as a Single Agent BRAFTOVI when used as a single agent is associated with an increased risk of certain adverse reactions compared to when BRAFTOVI is used in combination with binimetinib. Grades 3 or 4 dermatologic reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with BRAFTOVI single agent compared to 2% of patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If binimetinib is temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued, reduce the dose of BRAFTOVI as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.8 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment BRAFTOVI is indicated for use in combination with binimetinib. Refer to the binimetinib prescribing information for additional risk information that applies to combination use treatment."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Array BioPharma at 1-844-792-7729 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib is described in 192 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received BRAFTOVI (450 mg once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg twice daily) in a randomized open-label, active-controlled trial (COLUMBUS). The COLUMBUS trial [see Clinical Studies (14)] excluded patients with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc (>480 msec), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 11.8 months for patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib and 6.2 months for patients treated with vemurafenib. The most common (≥ 25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were nausea (7%), vomiting (7%) and pyrexia (4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 14% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were arthralgia (2%), fatigue (2%) and nausea (2%). Five percent (5%) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI; the most common were hemorrhage in 2% and headache in 1% of patients. Table 4 and Table 5 present adverse drug reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, identified in COLUMBUS. The COLUMBUS trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, as compared to vemurafenib, for any specific adverse reaction listed in Table 4.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) Males of Reproductive Potential: BRAFTOVI may impair fertility. (8.3) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available clinical data on the use of BRAFTOVI during pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, encorafenib produced embryo-fetal developmental changes in rats and rabbits and was an abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 26 (in the rat) and 178 (in the rabbit) times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 450 mg, with no clear findings at lower doses (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicity studies, administration of encorafenib to rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal weights, and increased incidence of total skeletal variations at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 26 times the human exposure based on area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] at the recommended clinical dose of 450 mg once daily). In pregnant rabbits, administration of encorafenib during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal body weights, increased incidence of total skeletal variations and increased post-implantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 178 times the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 450 mg once daily). While formal placental transfer studies have not been performed, encorafenib exposure in the fetal plasma of both rats and rabbits was up to 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively, of maternal exposure. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of encorafenib or its metabolites in human milk or the effects of encorafenib on the breastfed infant, or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from BRAFTOVI in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating BRAFTOVI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Contraception BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the final dose. Counsel patients to use a non-hormonal method of contraception since BRAFTOVI has the potential to render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Infertility Males Based on findings in male rats at doses approximately 13 times the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose, use of BRAFTOVI may impact fertility in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of BRAFTOVI have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 690 patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma who received BRAFTOVI at doses between 300 mg and 600 mg once daily in combination with binimetinib (45 mg twice daily) across multiple clinical trials, 20% were aged 65 to 74 years and 8% were aged 75 years and older. No overall differences in the safety or effectiveness of BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib were observed in elderly patients as compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Dose adjustment for BRAFTOVI is not recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A recommended dose has not been established for patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to < 90 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A recommended dose has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min)."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (COLUMBUS; NCT01909453). Eligible patients were required to have BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, as detected using the bioMerieux THxID™BRAF assay. Patients were permitted to have received immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting and one prior line of immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was prohibited. Randomization was stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a or IVM1b, versus IVM1c), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 versus 1), and prior immunotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease (yes versus no). Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily in combination with binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib), BRAFTOVI 300 mg once daily, or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Only the results of the approved dosing (BRAFTOVI 450 mg in combination with binimetinib 45 mg) are described below. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by a blinded independent central review, to compare BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib with vemurafenib. Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall survival (OS), as well as objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) which were assessed by central review. A total of 577 patients were randomized, 192 to the BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib arm, 194 to the BRAFTOVI arm, and 191 to the vemurafenib arm. Of the 383 patients randomized to either the BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib or the vemurafenib arms, the median age was 56 years (20 to 89 years), 59% were male, 91% were White, and 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Ninety-five percent (95%) had metastatic disease, 65% were Stage IVM1c, and 4% received prior CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 directed antibodies. Twenty-eight percent (28%) had elevated baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 45% had ≥ 3 organs with tumor involvement at baseline, and 3% had brain metastases. Based on centralized testing, 100% of patients' tumors tested positive for BRAF mutations; BRAF V600E (88%), BRAF V600K (11%), or both (<1%). BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to vemurafenib. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 6 and Figure 1.

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Encorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF V600E, as well as wild-type BRAF and CRAF in in vitro cell-free assays with IC50 values of 0.35, 0.47, and 0.3 nM, respectively. Mutations in the BRAF gene, such as BRAF V600E, can result in constitutively activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth. Encorafenib was also able to bind to other kinases in vitro including JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, LIMK1, LIMK2, MEK4, and STK36 and substantially reduce ligand binding to these kinases at clinically achievable concentrations (≤ 0.9 µM). Encorafenib inhibited in vitro growth of tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600 E, D, and K mutations. In mice implanted with tumor cells expressing BRAF V600E, encorafenib induced tumor regressions associated with RAF/MEK/ERK pathway suppression. Encorafenib and binimetinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared with either drug alone, co-administration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive cell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Additionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology A dedicated study to evaluate the QT prolongation potential of BRAFTOVI has not been conducted. BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation. Following administration of the recommended dose of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, based on a central tendency analysis of QTc in a study of adult patients with melanoma, the largest mean (90% CI) QTcF change from baseline (ΔQTcF) was 18 (14 to 22) ms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumors, including advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma harboring a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. After a single dose, systemic exposure of encorafenib was dose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 700 mg. After once-daily dosing, systemic exposure of encorafenib was less than dose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 800 mg. Steady-state was reached within 15 days, with exposure being 50% lower compared to Day 1; intersubject variability (CV%) of AUC ranged from 12% to 69%. Absorption After oral administration, the median Tmax of encorafenib is 2 hours. At least 86% of the dose is absorbed. Effect of Food Administration of a single dose of BRAFTOVI 100 mg (0.2 times the recommended dose) with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (comprised of approximately 150 calories from protein, 350 calories from carbohydrates, and 500 calories from fat) decreased the mean maximum encorafenib concentration (Cmax) by 36% with no effect on AUC. Distribution Encorafenib is 86% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.58. The geometric mean (CV%) of apparent volume of distribution is 164 L (70%). Elimination The mean (CV%) terminal half-life (t1/2) of encorafenib is 3.5 hours (17%), and the apparent clearance is 14 L/h (54%) at day 1, increasing to 32 L/h (59%) at steady-state. Metabolism The primary metabolic pathway is N-dealkylation, with CYP3A4 as the main contributor (83%) to total oxidative clearance of encorafenib in human liver microsomes, followed by CYP2C19 (16%) and CYP2D6 (1%). Excretion Following a single oral dose of 100 mg radiolabeled encorafenib, 47% (5% unchanged) of the administered dose was recovered in the feces and 47% (2% unchanged) was recovered in the urine. Specific Populations Age (19 to 89 years), sex, body weight, mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), and mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to < 90 mL/min) do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib. The effect of race or ethnicity, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), and severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) on encorafenib pharmacokinetics have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Encorafenib: Coadministration of a strong (posaconazole) or moderate (diltiazem) CYP3A4 inhibitor with BRAFTOVI increased the AUC of encorafenib by 3- and 2-fold, respectively, and increased the Cmax by 68% and 45%, respectively, after a single BRAFTOVI dose of 50 mg (0.1 times the recommended dose). Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers on Encorafenib: The effect of coadministration of a CYP3A4 inducer on encorafenib exposure has not been studied. In clinical trials, steady-state encorafenib exposures were lower than encorafenib exposures after the first dose, suggesting CYP3A4 auto-induction. Effect of Acid Reducing Agents on Encorafenib: Coadministration of a proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole, had no effect on AUC and Cmax of encorafenib. Combination Treatment: Coadministration of BRAFTOVI (UGT1A1 inhibitor) with binimetinib (UGT1A1 substrate) had no effect on binimetinib exposure. In Vitro Studies Effect of Encorafenib on CYP/UGT Substrates: Encorafenib is a reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A, and a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Encorafenib induced CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Effect of Transporters on Encorafenib: Encorafenib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Encorafenib is not a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) or organic cation transporter (OCT1) at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Effect of Encorafenib on Transporters: Encorafenib inhibited P-gp, BCRP, OCT2, organic anion transporter (OAT1, OAT3), OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OCT1 or MRP2 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with encorafenib have not been conducted. Encorafenib was not genotoxic in studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells, or micronuclei in bone marrow of rats. No dedicated fertility studies were performed with encorafenib in animals. In a general toxicology study in rats, decreased testes and epididymis weights, tubular degeneration in testes, and oligospermia in epididymides were observed at doses approximately 13 times the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose based on AUC. No effects on reproductive organs were observed in either sex in any of the non-human primate toxicity studies."
