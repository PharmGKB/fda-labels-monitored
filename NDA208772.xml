        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of ALUNBRIG with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG. (2.3, 7.1) CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of ALUNBRIG with strong CYP3A inducers. (7.2) CYP3A Substrates: Hormonal contraceptives may be ineffective due to decreased exposure. (7.3) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase Brigatinib Plasma Concentrations Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased brigatinib plasma concentrations and may result in increased adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors with ALUNBRIG, including but not limited to certain antivirals (e.g., boceprevir, cobicistat, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin), antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole), and conivaptan. Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice as it may also increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG by approximately 50% [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 7.2 Drugs That May Decrease Brigatinib Plasma Concentrations Strong CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of ALUNBRIG with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased brigatinib plasma concentrations and may result in decreased efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers with ALUNBRIG, including but not limited to rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's Wort [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by Brigatinib CYP3A Substrates Brigatinib induces CYP3A in vitro and may decrease concentrations of CYP3A substrates. Coadministration of ALUNBRIG with CYP3A substrates, including hormonal contraceptives, can result in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy of CYP3A substrates [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].",
        "Drug Interactions Effects of Other Drugs on Brigatinib Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of 200 mg twice daily doses of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) with a single 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG increased brigatinib Cmax by 21% and AUC0-INF by 101%, relative to a 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors: Coadministration of 600 mg twice daily doses of gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) with a single 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG decreased brigatinib Cmax by 41% and AUC0-INF by 12%, relative to a 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone. The effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib is not clinically meaningful and the underlying mechanism for the decreased exposure of brigatinib is unknown. Strong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of 600 mg daily doses of rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer) with a single 180 mg dose of ALUNBRIG decreased brigatinib Cmax by 60% and AUC0-INF by 80%, relative to a 180 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. P-gp and BCRP Inhibitors: In vitro studies suggest that brigatinib is a substrate of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Given that brigatinib exhibits high solubility and high permeability in vitro, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors are unlikely to increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib. Other Transporters: Brigatinib is not a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), organic anion transporter (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation transporter (OCT1, OCT2), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE1, MATE2K), or bile salt export pump (BSEP). Effects of Brigatinib on Other Drugs Transporter Substrates: Brigatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OCT1, MATE1, and MATE2K in vitro. Therefore, brigatinib may have the potential to increase concentrations of coadministered substrates of these transporters. Brigatinib at clinically relevant concentrations did not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 or BSEP. CYP Substrates: Brigatinib and its primary metabolite, AP26123, did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. Brigatinib, at clinically relevant plasma concentrations, induced CYP3A via activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR). Brigatinib may also induce CYP2C enzymes via the same mechanism at clinically relevant concentrations."

Treatment with brigatinib resulted in chromosomal damage in an in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus in the rat, but was not mutagenic in the Ames or in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration tests. Dedicated animal fertility studies were not conducted with brigatinib. Testicular toxicity was observed in repeat-dose animal studies at doses resulting in exposure as low as 0.2 times the exposure in patients at the 180 mg dose. In rats, findings included lower weight of testes, seminal vesicles and prostate gland, and testicular tubular degeneration; these effects were not reversible during the 2-month recovery period. In monkeys, findings included reduced size of testes along with microscopic evidence of hypospermatogenesis; these effects were reversible during the recovery period."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Brigatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity at clinically achievable concentrations against multiple kinases including ALK, ROS1, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and FLT-3 as well as EGFR deletion and point mutations. Brigatinib inhibited autophosphorylation of ALK and ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT3, AKT, ERK1/2, and S6 in in vitro and in vivo assays. Brigatinib also inhibited the in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenograft growth in mice. At clinically achievable concentrations (≤ 500 nM), brigatinib inhibited the in vitro viability of cells expressing EML4-ALK and 17 mutant forms associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors including crizotinib, as well as EGFR-Del (E746-A750), ROS1-L2026M, FLT3-F691L, and FLT3-D835Y. Brigatinib exhibited in vivo anti-tumor activity against 4 mutant forms of EML4-ALK, including G1202R and L1196M mutants identified in NSCLC tumors in patients who have progressed on crizotinib. Brigatinib also reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival in mice implanted intracranially with an ALK-driven tumor cell line."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The geometric mean (CV%) steady-state maximum concentration (Cmax) of brigatinib at ALUNBRIG doses of 90 mg and 180 mg once daily was 552 (65%) ng/mL and 1452 (60%) ng/mL, respectively, and the corresponding area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-Tau) was 8165 (57%) ng∙h/mL and 20276 (56%) ng∙h/mL. After a single dose and repeat dosing of ALUNBRIG, systemic exposure of brigatinib was dose proportional over the dose range of 60 mg (0.3 times the approved 180 mg dose) to 240 mg (1.3 times the approved 180 mg dose) once daily. The mean accumulation ratio after repeat dosing was 1.9 to 2.4. Absorption Following administration of single oral doses of ALUNBRIG of 30 to 240 mg, the median time to peak concentration (Tmax) ranged from 1 to 4 hours. Effect of Food Brigatinib Cmax was reduced by 13% with no effect on AUC in healthy subjects administered ALUNBRIG after a high fat meal (approximately 920 calories, 58 grams carbohydrate, 59 grams fat and 40 grams protein) compared to the Cmax and AUC after overnight fasting. Distribution Brigatinib is 66% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is not concentration-dependent in vitro. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.69. Following oral administration of ALUNBRIG 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of brigatinib at steady-state was 153 L. Elimination Following oral administration of ALUNBRIG 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of brigatinib at steady-state is 12.7 L/h and the mean plasma elimination half-life is 25 hours. Metabolism Brigatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled brigatinib to healthy subjects, N-demethylation and cysteine conjugation were the two major metabolic pathways. Unchanged brigatinib (92%) and its primary metabolite, AP26123 (3.5%), were the major circulating radioactive components. The steady-state AUC of AP26123 was less than 10% of AUC of brigatinib exposure in patients. The metabolite, AP26123, inhibited ALK with approximately 3-fold lower potency than brigatinib in vitro. Excretion Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled brigatinib to healthy subjects, 65% of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 25% of the administered dose was recovered in urine. Unchanged brigatinib represented 41% and 86% of the total radioactivity in feces and urine, respectively. Specific Populations Age, race, sex, body weight, and albumin concentration have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib. Hepatic Impairment As hepatic elimination is a major route of excretion for brigatinib, hepatic impairment may result in increased plasma brigatinib concentrations. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, brigatinib exposures were similar between 49 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin within upper limit of normal [ULN] and AST greater than ULN or total bilirubin greater than 1 and up to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) and 377 subjects with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within ULN). The pharmacokinetics of brigatinib in patients with moderate (total bilirubin greater than 1.5 and up to 3.0 times ULN and any AST) to severe (total bilirubin greater than 3.0 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment has not been studied. Renal Impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, brigatinib exposures were similar among 125 subjects with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to less than 90 mL/min), 34 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to less than 60 mL/min) and 270 subjects with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 90 mL/min), suggesting that no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 mL/min) were not included in clinical trials. Drug Interactions Effects of Other Drugs on Brigatinib Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of 200 mg twice daily doses of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) with a single 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG increased brigatinib Cmax by 21% and AUC0-INF by 101%, relative to a 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors: Coadministration of 600 mg twice daily doses of gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) with a single 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG decreased brigatinib Cmax by 41% and AUC0-INF by 12%, relative to a 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone. The effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib is not clinically meaningful and the underlying mechanism for the decreased exposure of brigatinib is unknown. Strong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of 600 mg daily doses of rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer) with a single 180 mg dose of ALUNBRIG decreased brigatinib Cmax by 60% and AUC0-INF by 80%, relative to a 180 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. P-gp and BCRP Inhibitors: In vitro studies suggest that brigatinib is a substrate of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Given that brigatinib exhibits high solubility and high permeability in vitro, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors are unlikely to increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib. Other Transporters: Brigatinib is not a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), organic anion transporter (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation transporter (OCT1, OCT2), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE1, MATE2K), or bile salt export pump (BSEP). Effects of Brigatinib on Other Drugs Transporter Substrates: Brigatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OCT1, MATE1, and MATE2K in vitro. Therefore, brigatinib may have the potential to increase concentrations of coadministered substrates of these transporters. Brigatinib at clinically relevant concentrations did not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 or BSEP. CYP Substrates: Brigatinib and its primary metabolite, AP26123, did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. Brigatinib, at clinically relevant plasma concentrations, induced CYP3A via activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR). Brigatinib may also induce CYP2C enzymes via the same mechanism at clinically relevant concentrations."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Administration of brigatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in dose-related skeletal anomalies at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily) as well as increased post-implantation loss, malformations, and decreased fetal body weight at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human exposure at 180 mg once daily) or greater. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, advise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in which pregnant rats were administered daily doses of brigatinib during organogenesis, dose-related skeletal (incomplete ossification, small incisors) and visceral anomalies were observed at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily). Malformations observed at 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human AUC at 180 mg once daily) included anasarca (generalized subcutaneous edema), anophthalmia (absent eyes), forelimb hyperflexion, small, short and/or bent limbs, multiple fused ribs, bent scapulae, omphalocele (intestine protruding into umbilicus), and gastroschisis (intestines protruding through a defect in the abdominal wall) along with visceral findings of moderate bilateral dilatation of the lateral ventricles."

Withhold ALUNBRIG for new or worsening respiratory symptoms and promptly evaluate for ILD/pneumonitis. Upon recovery, either dose reduce or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. (2.2, 5.1) Hypertension: Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and then at least monthly during treatment. For severe hypertension, withhold ALUNBRIG, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue. (2.2, 5.2) Bradycardia: Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly during treatment. If symptomatic, withhold ALUNBRIG, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue. (2.2, 5.3) Visual Disturbance: Advise patients to report visual symptoms. Withhold ALUNBRIG and obtain ophthalmologic evaluation, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. (2.2, 5.4) Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation: Monitor CPK levels regularly during treatment. Based on the severity, withhold ALUNBRIG, then resume or reduce dose. (2.2, 5.5) Pancreatic Enzyme Elevation: Monitor lipase and amylase levels regularly during treatment. Based on the severity, withhold ALUNBRIG, then resume or reduce dose. (2.2, 5.6) Hyperglycemia: Assess fasting serum glucose prior to starting ALUNBRIG and regularly during treatment. If not adequately controlled with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG, then consider dose reduction or permanently discontinue, based on severity. (2.2, 5.7) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use a non-hormonal method of effective contraception. (5.8, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have occurred with ALUNBRIG. In Trial ALTA (ALTA), ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group (90 mg once daily) and 9.1% of patients in the 90→180 mg group (180 mg once daily with 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily). Adverse reactions consistent with possible ILD/pneumonitis occurred early (within 9 days of initiation of ALUNBRIG; median onset was 2 days) in 6.4% of patients, with Grade 3 to 4 reactions occurring in 2.7%. Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, etc.), particularly during the first week of initiating ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG in any patient with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, and promptly evaluate for ILD/pneumonitis or other causes of respiratory symptoms (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tumor progression, and infectious pneumonia). For Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis, either resume ALUNBRIG with dose reduction according to Table 1 after recovery to baseline or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis or recurrence of Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Hypertension In ALTA, hypertension was reported in 11% of patients in the 90 mg group who received ALUNBRIG and 21% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 5.9% of patients overall. Control blood pressure prior to treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and at least monthly thereafter during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy. Upon resolution or improvement to Grade 1 severity, resume ALUNBRIG at a reduced dose. Consider permanent discontinuation of treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 hypertension or recurrence of Grade 3 hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Use caution when administering ALUNBRIG in combination with antihypertensive agents that cause bradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.3 Bradycardia Bradycardia can occur with ALUNBRIG. In ALTA, heart rates less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) occurred in 5.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 7.6% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 2 bradycardia occurred in 1 (0.9%) patient in the 90 mg group. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor patients more frequently if concomitant use of drug known to cause bradycardia cannot be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. For symptomatic bradycardia, withhold ALUNBRIG and review concomitant medications for those known to cause bradycardia. If a concomitant medication known to cause bradycardia is identified and discontinued or dose adjusted, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia; otherwise, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia. Discontinue ALUNBRIG for life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.4 Visual Disturbance In ALTA, adverse reactions leading to visual disturbance including blurred vision, diplopia, and reduced visual acuity, were reported in 7.3% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and 10% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 macular edema and cataract occurred in one patient each in the 90→180 mg group. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms. Withhold ALUNBRIG and obtain an ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with new or worsening visual symptoms of Grade 2 or greater severity. Upon recovery of Grade 2 or Grade 3 visual disturbances to Grade 1 severity or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 visual disturbances [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation In ALTA, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation occurred in 27% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and 48% of patients in the 90 mg→180 mg group. The incidence of Grade 3-4 CPK elevation was 2.8% in the 90 mg group and 12% in the 90→180 mg group. Dose reduction for CPK elevation occurred in 1.8% of patients in the 90 mg group and 4.5% in the 90→180 mg group. Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Monitor CPK levels during ALUNBRIG treatment. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose or at a reduced dose as described in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Pancreatic Enzyme Elevation In ALTA, amylase elevation occurred in 27% of patients in the 90 mg group and 39% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Lipase elevations occurred in 21% of patients in the 90 mg group and 45% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 2.7% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurred in 4.6% of patients in the 90 mg group and 5.5% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Monitor lipase and amylase during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzyme elevation. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose or at a reduced dose as described in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.7 Hyperglycemia In ALTA, 43% of patients who received ALUNBRIG experienced new or worsening hyperglycemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory assessment of serum fasting glucose levels, occurred in 3.7% of patients. Two of 20 (10%) patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance at baseline required initiation of insulin while receiving ALUNBRIG. Assess fasting serum glucose prior to initiation of ALUNBRIG and monitor periodically thereafter. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as needed. If adequate hyperglycemic control cannot be achieved with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG until adequate hyperglycemic control is achieved and consider reducing the dose of ALUNBRIG as described in Table 1 or permanently discontinuing ALUNBRIG [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Administration of brigatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in dose-related skeletal anomalies at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily) as well as increased post implantation loss, malformations, and decreased fetal body weight at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human exposure at 180 mg once daily) or higher. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALUNBRIG [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]."

(6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-217-6468 or www.alunbrig.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ALUNBRIG was evaluated in 219 patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received at least one dose of ALUNBRIG in ALTA after experiencing disease progression on crizotinib. Patients received ALUNBRIG 90 mg once daily continuously (90 mg group) or 90 mg once daily for 7 days followed by 180 mg once daily (90→180 mg group). The median duration of treatment was 7.5 months in the 90 mg group and 7.8 months in the 90→180 mg group. A total of 150 (68%) patients were exposed to ALUNBRIG for greater than or equal to 6 months and 42 (19%) patients were exposed for greater than or equal to one year. The study population characteristics were: median age 54 years (range: 18 to 82), age less than 65 years (77%), female (57%), White (67%), Asian (31%), Stage IV disease (98%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (97%), never or former smoker (95%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (93%), and brain metastases at baseline (69%) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients in the 90 mg group and 40% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (5.5% overall, 3.7% in the 90 mg group, and 7.3% in the 90→180 mg group) and ILD/pneumonitis (4.6% overall, 1.8% in the 90 mg group and 7.3% in the 90→180 mg group). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.7% of patients and consisted of pneumonia (2 patients), sudden death, dyspnea, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, bacterial meningitis and urosepsis (1 patient each). In ALTA, 2.8% of patients in the 90 mg group and 8.2% of patients in the 90→180 mg group permanently discontinued ALUNBRIG for adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were ILD/pneumonitis (0.9% in the 90 mg group and 1.8% in the 90→180 mg group) and pneumonia (1.8% in the 90→180 mg group only). In ALTA, 14% of patients required a dose reduction due to adverse reactions (7.3% in the 90 mg group and 20% in the 90→180 mg group). The most common adverse reaction that led to dose reduction was increased creatine phosphokinase for both regimens (1.8% in the 90 mg group and 4.5% in the 90→180 mg group). Table 3 and Table 4 summarize the common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in ALTA.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Administration of brigatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in dose-related skeletal anomalies at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily) as well as increased post-implantation loss, malformations, and decreased fetal body weight at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human exposure at 180 mg once daily) or greater. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, advise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in which pregnant rats were administered daily doses of brigatinib during organogenesis, dose-related skeletal (incomplete ossification, small incisors) and visceral anomalies were observed at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily). Malformations observed at 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human AUC at 180 mg once daily) included anasarca (generalized subcutaneous edema), anophthalmia (absent eyes), forelimb hyperflexion, small, short and/or bent limbs, multiple fused ribs, bent scapulae, omphalocele (intestine protruding into umbilicus), and gastroschisis (intestines protruding through a defect in the abdominal wall) along with visceral findings of moderate bilateral dilatation of the lateral ventricles. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the secretion of brigatinib in human milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for 1 week following the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months after the final dose. Counsel patients to use a non-hormonal method of contraception since ALUNBRIG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective [ see Drug Interaction (7.3]). Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 3 months after the final dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Infertility Based on findings in male reproductive organs in animals, ALUNBRIG may cause reduced fertility in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of ALUNBRIG in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ALUNBRIG did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Of the 222 patients in ALTA, 19.4% were 65-74 years and 4.1% were 75 years or older. No clinically relevant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin within upper limit of normal [ULN] and AST greater than ULN or total bilirubin greater than 1 and up to 1.5 times ULN and any AST). The pharmacokinetics and safety of ALUNBRIG in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment have not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) 30 to 89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault)]. The pharmacokinetics and safety of ALUNBRIG in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) have not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ALUNBRIG was demonstrated in a two-arm, open-label, multicenter trial (ALTA, NCT02094573) in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had progressed on crizotinib. The study required patients to have a documented ALK rearrangement based on an FDA-approved test or a different test with adequate archival tissue to confirm ALK arrangement by the Vysis® ALK Break-Apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Probe Kit test. Key eligibility criteria included an ECOG Performance Status of 0-2 and progression on crizotinib. Neurologically stable patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases were permitted to enroll. Patients with a history of interstitial lung disease or drug-related pneumonitis or who had received crizotinib within 3 days of the first dose of brigatinib were excluded. The major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed overall response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). Additional efficacy outcome measures included Investigator-assessed ORR, duration of response (DOR), intracranial ORR, and intracranial DOR. A total of 222 patients were randomized to receive ALUNBRIG either 90 mg once daily (90 mg arm; n=112) or 180 mg once daily following a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily (90→180 mg arm; n=110). Randomization was stratified by brain metastases (present versus absent) and best prior response to crizotinib (complete or partial response versus any other response/unevaluable). Baseline demographic characteristics of the overall study population were: median age 54 years (range 18 to 82, 23% 65 and over), 67% White and 31% Asian, 57% female, 36% ECOG PS 0 and 57% ECOG PS 1, and 95% never or former smokers. The disease characteristics of the overall study population were: Stage IV disease in 98%, adenocarcinoma histology in 97%, prior systemic chemotherapy in 74%, metastatic disease to the brain in 69% (61% had received prior radiation to the brain), bone metastases in 39%, and liver metastases in 26% of patients. Sixty-four percent of patients had an objective response to prior crizotinib. The median duration of follow-up was 8 months (range: 0.1-20.2). Efficacy results from ALTA are summarized in Table 5.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brigatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity at clinically achievable concentrations against multiple kinases including ALK, ROS1, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and FLT-3 as well as EGFR deletion and point mutations. Brigatinib inhibited autophosphorylation of ALK and ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT3, AKT, ERK1/2, and S6 in in vitro and in vivo assays. Brigatinib also inhibited the in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenograft growth in mice. At clinically achievable concentrations (≤ 500 nM), brigatinib inhibited the in vitro viability of cells expressing EML4-ALK and 17 mutant forms associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors including crizotinib, as well as EGFR-Del (E746-A750), ROS1-L2026M, FLT3-F691L, and FLT3-D835Y. Brigatinib exhibited in vivo anti-tumor activity against 4 mutant forms of EML4-ALK, including G1202R and L1196M mutants identified in NSCLC tumors in patients who have progressed on crizotinib. Brigatinib also reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival in mice implanted intracranially with an ALK-driven tumor cell line. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Brigatinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of the pharmacodynamic response are unknown. Cardiac Electrophysiology The QT interval prolongation potential of ALUNBRIG was assessed in 123 patients following once daily ALUNBRIG doses of 30 mg (1/6th of the approved 180 mg dose) to 240 mg (1.3 times the approved 180 mg dose). ALUNBRIG did not prolong the QT interval to a clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The geometric mean (CV%) steady-state maximum concentration (Cmax) of brigatinib at ALUNBRIG doses of 90 mg and 180 mg once daily was 552 (65%) ng/mL and 1452 (60%) ng/mL, respectively, and the corresponding area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-Tau) was 8165 (57%) ng∙h/mL and 20276 (56%) ng∙h/mL. After a single dose and repeat dosing of ALUNBRIG, systemic exposure of brigatinib was dose proportional over the dose range of 60 mg (0.3 times the approved 180 mg dose) to 240 mg (1.3 times the approved 180 mg dose) once daily. The mean accumulation ratio after repeat dosing was 1.9 to 2.4. Absorption Following administration of single oral doses of ALUNBRIG of 30 to 240 mg, the median time to peak concentration (Tmax) ranged from 1 to 4 hours. Effect of Food Brigatinib Cmax was reduced by 13% with no effect on AUC in healthy subjects administered ALUNBRIG after a high fat meal (approximately 920 calories, 58 grams carbohydrate, 59 grams fat and 40 grams protein) compared to the Cmax and AUC after overnight fasting. Distribution Brigatinib is 66% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is not concentration-dependent in vitro. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.69. Following oral administration of ALUNBRIG 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of brigatinib at steady-state was 153 L. Elimination Following oral administration of ALUNBRIG 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of brigatinib at steady-state is 12.7 L/h and the mean plasma elimination half-life is 25 hours. Metabolism Brigatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled brigatinib to healthy subjects, N-demethylation and cysteine conjugation were the two major metabolic pathways. Unchanged brigatinib (92%) and its primary metabolite, AP26123 (3.5%), were the major circulating radioactive components. The steady-state AUC of AP26123 was less than 10% of AUC of brigatinib exposure in patients. The metabolite, AP26123, inhibited ALK with approximately 3-fold lower potency than brigatinib in vitro. Excretion Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled brigatinib to healthy subjects, 65% of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 25% of the administered dose was recovered in urine. Unchanged brigatinib represented 41% and 86% of the total radioactivity in feces and urine, respectively. Specific Populations Age, race, sex, body weight, and albumin concentration have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib. Hepatic Impairment As hepatic elimination is a major route of excretion for brigatinib, hepatic impairment may result in increased plasma brigatinib concentrations. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, brigatinib exposures were similar between 49 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin within upper limit of normal [ULN] and AST greater than ULN or total bilirubin greater than 1 and up to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) and 377 subjects with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within ULN). The pharmacokinetics of brigatinib in patients with moderate (total bilirubin greater than 1.5 and up to 3.0 times ULN and any AST) to severe (total bilirubin greater than 3.0 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment has not been studied. Renal Impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, brigatinib exposures were similar among 125 subjects with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to less than 90 mL/min), 34 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to less than 60 mL/min) and 270 subjects with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 90 mL/min), suggesting that no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 mL/min) were not included in clinical trials. Drug Interactions Effects of Other Drugs on Brigatinib Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of 200 mg twice daily doses of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) with a single 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG increased brigatinib Cmax by 21% and AUC0-INF by 101%, relative to a 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors: Coadministration of 600 mg twice daily doses of gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) with a single 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG decreased brigatinib Cmax by 41% and AUC0-INF by 12%, relative to a 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone. The effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib is not clinically meaningful and the underlying mechanism for the decreased exposure of brigatinib is unknown. Strong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of 600 mg daily doses of rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer) with a single 180 mg dose of ALUNBRIG decreased brigatinib Cmax by 60% and AUC0-INF by 80%, relative to a 180 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. P-gp and BCRP Inhibitors: In vitro studies suggest that brigatinib is a substrate of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Given that brigatinib exhibits high solubility and high permeability in vitro, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors are unlikely to increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib. Other Transporters: Brigatinib is not a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), organic anion transporter (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation transporter (OCT1, OCT2), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE1, MATE2K), or bile salt export pump (BSEP). Effects of Brigatinib on Other Drugs Transporter Substrates: Brigatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OCT1, MATE1, and MATE2K in vitro. Therefore, brigatinib may have the potential to increase concentrations of coadministered substrates of these transporters. Brigatinib at clinically relevant concentrations did not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 or BSEP. CYP Substrates: Brigatinib and its primary metabolite, AP26123, did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. Brigatinib, at clinically relevant plasma concentrations, induced CYP3A via activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR). Brigatinib may also induce CYP2C enzymes via the same mechanism at clinically relevant concentrations."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with brigatinib. Treatment with brigatinib resulted in chromosomal damage in an in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus in the rat, but was not mutagenic in the Ames or in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration tests. Dedicated animal fertility studies were not conducted with brigatinib. Testicular toxicity was observed in repeat-dose animal studies at doses resulting in exposure as low as 0.2 times the exposure in patients at the 180 mg dose. In rats, findings included lower weight of testes, seminal vesicles and prostate gland, and testicular tubular degeneration; these effects were not reversible during the 2-month recovery period. In monkeys, findings included reduced size of testes along with microscopic evidence of hypospermatogenesis; these effects were reversible during the recovery period."
