        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe Myelosuppression: Obtain complete blood counts prior to and on Day 15 of each cycle. Withhold and resume at next lower LONSURF dosage as recommended. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Severe Myelosuppression In the 1114 patients who received LONSURF as a single agent, LONSURF caused severe or life-threatening myelosuppression (Grade 3-4) consisting of neutropenia (38%), anemia (17%), thrombocytopenia (4%) and febrile neutropenia (3%). Three patients (0.3%) died due to neutropenic infection/sepsis; four other patients (0.5%) died due to septic shock. A total of 14% of patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factors. In the 246 patients who received LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab, LONSURF caused severe or life-threatening myelosuppression (Grade 3-4) consisting of neutropenia (52%), anemia (5%), thrombocytopenia (4%) and febrile neutropenia (0.4%). One patient (0.4%) died due to abdominal sepsis and two other patients (0.8%) died due to septic shock. A total of 29% of patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factors. Obtain complete blood counts prior to and on Day 15 of each cycle of LONSURF and more frequently as clinically indicated. Withhold LONSURF for severe myelosuppression and resume at the next lower dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, LONSURF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Trifluridine/tipiracil caused embryo-fetal lethality and embryo-fetal toxicity in pregnant rats when orally administered during gestation at dosage levels resulting in exposures lower than those achieved at the recommended dosage of 35 mg/m 2 twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with LONSURF and for at least 6 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Severe Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities for single agent LONSURF (≥10%) are neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities for LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab (≥20%) are neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, increased AST, increased ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, decreased sodium, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Taiho Oncology, Inc. at 1-844-878-2446 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section and below reflect exposure to LONSURF at the recommended dose in 533 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in RECOURSE, 246 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with LONSURF as monotherapy in SUNLIGHT and 335 patients with metastatic gastric cancer in TAGS. Among the 1114 patients who received LONSURF as a single agent, 12% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 1% were exposed for 12 months or longer. The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities (≥10%) were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and pyrexia. Among the 246 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab in SUNLIGHT, 39% were exposed for 6 months or longer, and 14% were exposed for 12 months or longer. The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities (≥20%) were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, increased AST, increased ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, decreased sodium, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite. Metastatic Colorectal Cancer LONSURF as a single agent The safety of LONSURF was evaluated in RECOURSE, a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients received LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 /dose (n=533) or placebo (n=265) twice daily on Days 1 through 5 and Days 8 through 12 of each 28-day cycle. In RECOURSE, 12% of patients received LONSURF for more than 6 months and 1% of patients received LONSURF for more than 1 year. The study population characteristics were: median age 63 years; 61% male; 57% White, 35% Asian, and 1% Black. The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities (≥10% in incidence) in patients treated with LONSURF at a rate that exceeds the rate in patients receiving placebo were anemia, neutropenia, asthenia/fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and pyrexia. In RECOURSE, 3.6% of patients discontinued LONSURF for an adverse reaction and 14% of patients required a dose reduction. The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to dose reduction were neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and diarrhea. Table 3 and Table 4 list the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities (graded using CTCAE v4.03), respectively, observed in RECOURSE.

LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab The safety of LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab was evaluated in SUNLIGHT, an international, randomized, open label study in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The study population characteristics were: median age 63 years (20 to 90 years); 52% male; 88% White, 1.4% Black, 0.2% Asian, 0.2% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 9.6% were unknown; and baseline ECOG performance status 0 (46%), 1 (54%), or 2 (0.2%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were intestinal obstruction (2.8%), and COVID-19 (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.2% of patients who received LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab, including rectal fistula (0.4%), bowel perforation (0.4%) and atrial fibrillation (0.4%). Permanent treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients. The adverse reaction which resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation in ≥2% of patients was fatigue. Dosage reductions due to an adverse reaction or laboratory abnormality occurred in 7% of patients. At least one dose reduction in 3.7% of patients was required for neutropenia. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients who received LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab. The adverse reaction that required dosage interruption in ≥2% of patients was nausea. The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities (≥20% in incidence) in patients treated with LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased alkaline phosphatase, decreased sodium, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite. Table 5 and Table 6 list the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, observed in SUNLIGHT.

Previous treatments must have included a fluoropyrimidine, a platinum, and either a taxane or irinotecan. Patients with HER2/neu-positive tumors must have received prior HER2/neu-targeted therapy, if available. Adjuvant chemotherapy could be counted as one prior regimen in patients who had recurrence during or within 6 months of completion of the adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients received LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 /dose (n=335) or placebo (n=168) twice daily on Days 1 through 5 and Days 8 through 12 of each 28-day cycle with best supportive care. In TAGS, 10% of patients received LONSURF for more than 6 months and 0.9% of patients received LONSURF for more than 1 year. The study population characteristics were: median age 63 years (24 to 89 years); 73% male; 70% White, 16% Asian, and 1% Black. The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities (≥10% in incidence) in patients treated with LONSURF at a rate that exceeds the rate in patients receiving placebo were neutropenia, anemia, nausea, decreased appetite, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, and diarrhea. In TAGS, 13% of patients discontinued LONSURF for an adverse reaction and 11% of patients required a dose reduction. The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to dose reduction were neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhea. Table 7 and Table 8 list the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities (graded using CTCAE v4.03), respectively, observed in TAGS.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Geriatric Use : For LONSURF as a single agent, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, Grade 3 anemia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred more commonly in patients 65 years or older. ( 8.5 ) For LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred more commonly in patients 65 years or older. ( 8.5 ) Hepatic Impairment : Do not initiate LONSURF in patients with baseline moderate or severe hepatic impairment. ( 8.7 ) Renal Impairment : Reduce LONSURF dose in patients with severe renal impairment. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] , LONSURF can cause fetal harm. LONSURF caused embryo-fetal lethality and embryo-fetal toxicity in pregnant rats when given during gestation at doses resulting in exposures lower than or similar to human exposures at the recommended clinical dose (see Data ) . There are no available data on LONSURF use in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Trifluridine/tipiracil was administered orally once daily to female rats during organogenesis at dose levels of 15, 50, and 150 mg/kg [trifluridine (FTD) equivalent]. Decreased fetal weight was observed at FTD doses ≥50 mg/kg (approximately 0.33 times the FTD exposure at the clinical dose of 35 mg/m 2 twice daily). At the FTD dose of 150 mg/kg (approximately 0.92 times the FTD exposure at the clinical dose of 35 mg/m 2 twice daily) embryolethality and structural anomalies (kinked tail, cleft palate, ectrodactyly, anasarca, alterations in great vessels, and skeletal anomalies) were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of trifluridine, tipiracil or its metabolites in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. In nursing rats, trifluridine and tipiracil or their metabolites were present in breast milk (see Data ) . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with LONSURF and for 1 day following the final dose. Data Radioactivity was excreted in the milk of nursing rats dosed with trifluridine/tipiracil containing 14 C-FTD or 14 C-tipiracil (TPI). Levels of FTD-derived radioactivity were as high as approximately 50% of the exposure in maternal plasma an hour after dosing with trifluridine/tipiracil and were approximately the same as those in maternal plasma for up to 12 hours following dosing. Exposure to TPI-derived radioactivity was higher in milk than in maternal plasma beginning 2 hours after dosing and continuing for at least 12 hours following administration of trifluridine/tipiracil. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LONSURF [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception LONSURF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LONSURF and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with LONSURF and for at least 3 months after the final dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of LONSURF in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Dental toxicity including whitening, breakage, and malocclusion (degeneration and disarrangement in the ameloblasts, papillary layer cells and odontoblasts) were observed in rats treated with trifluridine/tipiracil at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg (approximately 0.33 times the exposure at the clinical dose of 35 mg/m 2 twice daily). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1114 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer or gastric cancer who received single agent LONSURF in clinical studies, 45% were 65 years of age or over, and 11% were 75 and over. In the 246 patients who received LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab; 41% were 65 years of age or over, and 10% were 75 and over. While these studies were not designed to detect a difference in efficacy, no overall differences were observed in patients 65 or older versus younger patients with either LONSURF as a single agent or LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab. Patients 65 years of age or older who received LONSURF as a single agent had a higher incidence of the following hematologic laboratory abnormalities compared to patients younger than 65 years: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (46% vs 32%), Grade 3 anemia (20% vs 14%), and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (6% vs 3%). Patients 65 years of age or older who received LONSURF in combination with bevacizumab had a higher incidence of the following hematologic laboratory abnormalities compared to patients younger than 65 years: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (60% vs 46%) and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (5% vs 4%). 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr of 30 to 89 mL/min as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault formula). Reduce the dose of LONSURF for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr of 15 to 29 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . The pharmacokinetics of trifluridine and tipiracil have not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No adjustment to the starting dosage of LONSURF is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Do not initiate LONSURF in patients with baseline moderate or severe (total bilirubin >1.5 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action LONSURF consists of a thymidine-based nucleoside analog, trifluridine, and the thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, tipiracil, at a molar ratio 1:0.5 (weight ratio, 1:0.471). Inclusion of tipiracil increases trifluridine exposure by inhibiting its metabolism by thymidine phosphorylase. Following uptake into cancer cells, trifluridine is incorporated into DNA, interferes with DNA synthesis and inhibits cell proliferation. Trifluridine/tipiracil demonstrated anti-tumor activity against KRAS wild-type and mutant human colorectal cancer xenografts in mice. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology LONSURF administered to 42 patients with advanced solid tumors at the recommended dosage had no large effect (i.e. >20 ms) in the mean QTc interval when compared to placebo and no exposure-QT relationship was identified. Two of 42 patients (4.8%) had QTc >500 msec and 2.4% had a QTc increase from baseline >60 msec. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After twice daily dosing of LONSURF, systemic exposure (AUC) of trifluridine increased more than dose-proportionally over the dose range of 15 mg/m 2 (0.43 times the recommended dose) to 35 mg/m 2 . The accumulation of trifluridine was 3-fold for AUC 0-12hr and 2-fold for C max at steady state while no accumulation was observed for tipiracil. Administration of a single dose of LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 increased the mean AUC 0-last of trifluridine by 37-fold and C max by 22-fold with reduced variability compared to administration of a single dose of trifluridine 35 mg/m 2 alone. Absorption Following a single oral administration of LONSURF at 35 mg/m 2 in patients with cancer, the mean time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) of trifluridine was around 2 hours. Food Effect A standardized high-fat, high-calorie meal decreased trifluridine C max , tipiracil C max and AUC by approximately 40%, but did not change trifluridine AUC compared to those in a fasting state in patients with cancer following administration of a single dose of LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 . Distribution Trifluridine mainly binds to human serum albumin. The in vitro protein binding of trifluridine in human plasma is >96%, independent of drug concentration and presence of tipiracil. Plasma protein binding of tipiracil is below 8%. Elimination After administration of LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 , the mean elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of trifluridine was 1.4 hours and of tipiracil was 2.1 hours after a single dose. The mean elimination half-life at steady state of trifluridine was 2.1 hours and of tipiracil was 2.4 hours. Metabolism Trifluridine and tipiracil are not metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Trifluridine is mainly eliminated by metabolism via thymidine phosphorylase to form an inactive metabolite, 5-(trifluoromethyl) uracil (FTY). No other major metabolites were detected in plasma or urine. Excretion After single oral administration of LONSURF (60 mg) with [ 14 C]-trifluridine, the total cumulative excretion of radioactivity was 60% of the administered dose. The majority of recovered radioactivity was eliminated into urine (55% of the dose) as FTY and trifluridine glucuronide isomers within 24 hours and the excretion into feces and expired air was <3% for both. The unchanged trifluridine was <3% of administered dose recovered in the urine and feces. After single oral administration of LONSURF (60 mg) with [ 14 C]-tipiracil hydrochloride, recovered radioactivity was 77% of the dose, which consisted of 27% urinary excretion and 50% fecal excretion. Tipiracil was the major component and 6-HMU was the major metabolite in urine, and feces. Specific Populations Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there is no clinically relevant effect of age, sex, or race (White or Asian) on the pharmacokinetics of trifluridine or tipiracil. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated renal impairment study, all patients received LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 twice daily except for patients with severe renal impairment who received 20 mg/m 2 twice daily. Mild renal impairment (CLcr of 60 to 89 mL/min as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) had no clinically important effect on steady-state AUC 0-last of trifluridine and tipiracil. Moderate renal impairment (CLcr of 30 to 59 mL/min) increased steady-state AUC 0-last of trifluridine by 56% and tipiracil by 139% compared to normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min). Severe renal impairment (CLcr of 15 to 29 mL/min) increased the dose-normalized steady-state AUC 0-last of trifluridine by 140% and tipiracil by 614% compared to normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of trifluridine and tipiracil have not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease. Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinically important differences in the mean exposures of trifluridine and tipiracil were observed between patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin <1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) to moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) and patients with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN); however, 5 of 6 patients with moderate hepatic impairment experienced Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin levels. The pharmacokinetics of trifluridine and tipiracil have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage Modifications (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that trifluridine, tipiracil, and FTY did not inhibit the CYP enzymes and had no inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5. In vitro studies indicated that trifluridine was not an inhibitor of or substrate for human uptake and efflux transporters."

Administration of a single dose of LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 increased the mean AUC 0-last of trifluridine by 37-fold and C max by 22-fold with reduced variability compared to administration of a single dose of trifluridine 35 mg/m 2 alone. Absorption Following a single oral administration of LONSURF at 35 mg/m 2 in patients with cancer, the mean time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) of trifluridine was around 2 hours. Food Effect A standardized high-fat, high-calorie meal decreased trifluridine C max , tipiracil C max and AUC by approximately 40%, but did not change trifluridine AUC compared to those in a fasting state in patients with cancer following administration of a single dose of LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 . Distribution Trifluridine mainly binds to human serum albumin. The in vitro protein binding of trifluridine in human plasma is >96%, independent of drug concentration and presence of tipiracil. Plasma protein binding of tipiracil is below 8%. Elimination After administration of LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 , the mean elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of trifluridine was 1.4 hours and of tipiracil was 2.1 hours after a single dose. The mean elimination half-life at steady state of trifluridine was 2.1 hours and of tipiracil was 2.4 hours. Metabolism Trifluridine and tipiracil are not metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Trifluridine is mainly eliminated by metabolism via thymidine phosphorylase to form an inactive metabolite, 5-(trifluoromethyl) uracil (FTY). No other major metabolites were detected in plasma or urine. Excretion After single oral administration of LONSURF (60 mg) with [ 14 C]-trifluridine, the total cumulative excretion of radioactivity was 60% of the administered dose. The majority of recovered radioactivity was eliminated into urine (55% of the dose) as FTY and trifluridine glucuronide isomers within 24 hours and the excretion into feces and expired air was <3% for both. The unchanged trifluridine was <3% of administered dose recovered in the urine and feces. After single oral administration of LONSURF (60 mg) with [ 14 C]-tipiracil hydrochloride, recovered radioactivity was 77% of the dose, which consisted of 27% urinary excretion and 50% fecal excretion. Tipiracil was the major component and 6-HMU was the major metabolite in urine, and feces. Specific Populations Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there is no clinically relevant effect of age, sex, or race (White or Asian) on the pharmacokinetics of trifluridine or tipiracil. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated renal impairment study, all patients received LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 twice daily except for patients with severe renal impairment who received 20 mg/m 2 twice daily. Mild renal impairment (CLcr of 60 to 89 mL/min as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) had no clinically important effect on steady-state AUC 0-last of trifluridine and tipiracil. Moderate renal impairment (CLcr of 30 to 59 mL/min) increased steady-state AUC 0-last of trifluridine by 56% and tipiracil by 139% compared to normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min). Severe renal impairment (CLcr of 15 to 29 mL/min) increased the dose-normalized steady-state AUC 0-last of trifluridine by 140% and tipiracil by 614% compared to normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of trifluridine and tipiracil have not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease. Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinically important differences in the mean exposures of trifluridine and tipiracil were observed between patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin <1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) to moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) and patients with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN); however, 5 of 6 patients with moderate hepatic impairment experienced Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin levels. The pharmacokinetics of trifluridine and tipiracil have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage Modifications (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that trifluridine, tipiracil, and FTY did not inhibit the CYP enzymes and had no inductive effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5. In vitro studies indicated that trifluridine was not an inhibitor of or substrate for human uptake and efflux transporters."

Key eligibility criteria included prior treatment with at least 2 lines of standard chemotherapy for metastatic CRC, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1, absence of brain metastasis, and absence of ascites requiring drainage in the past four weeks. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive LONSURF 35 mg/m 2 or matching placebo orally twice daily after meals on Days 1-5 and 8-12 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by KRAS status (wild-type vs. mutant), time since diagnosis of first metastasis (<18 months vs. ≥ 18 months), and region (Japan vs. US, Europe and Australia). The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) and an additional efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 800 patients were randomized to LONSURF (N=534) with best supportive care (BSC) or matching placebo (N=266) plus BSC. The median age was 63 years, 61% were male, 58% and 35% were White and Asian respectively, and all patients had baseline ECOG PS of 0 or 1. The primary site of disease was colon (62%) or rectum (38%). KRAS status was wild-type (49%) or mutant (51%) at study entry. All patients received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. All but one patient received bevacizumab and all but two patients with KRAS wild-type tumors received panitumumab or cetuximab. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 9 and Figure 1 .

        "This Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 8/2023 PATIENT INFORMATION LONSURF ® (LON-serf) (trifluridine and tipiracil) tablets What is the most important information I should know about LONSURF? Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you receive LONSURF, at day 15 during treatment with LONSURF, and as needed to check your blood cell counts. LONSURF may cause serious side effects, including : Low blood cell counts. Low blood counts are common with LONSURF and can sometimes be severe and life-threatening. LONSURF can cause a decrease in your white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Low white blood cells can make you more likely to get serious infections that could lead to death. Your healthcare provider may: lower your dose of LONSURF or stop LONSURF if you have low white blood cell or low platelet counts. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with LONSURF: fever chills body aches See “ What are the possible side effects of LONSURF? ” for more information about side effects. What is LONSURF? LONSURF is a prescription medicine used: alone or in combination with the medicine bevacizumab to treat adults with colorectal cancer: that has spread to other parts of the body, and who have been previously treated with certain chemotherapy medicines. alone to treat adults with a kind of stomach cancer called gastric cancer including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction: that has spread to other parts of the body, and who have been previously treated with at least 2 types of treatment which included certain medicines.
