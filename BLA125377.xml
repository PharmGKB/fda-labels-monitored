No overall differences in safety or efficacy were reported between the elderly patients (65 years and over) and younger patients (less than 65 years). CA184-029 (adjuvant treatment of melanoma) and CHECKMATE-142 (metastatic colorectal cancer) did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Of the 550 patients randomized to nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered with YERVOY 1 mg/kg in CHECKMATE-214 (renal cell carcinoma), 38% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between elderly patients and younger patients. In elderly patients with intermediate or poor risk, no overall difference in effectiveness was reported."

        "11 DESCRIPTION Ipilimumab is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Ipilimumab is an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin with an approximate molecular weight of 148 kDa. Ipilimumab is produced in mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cell culture. YERVOY is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale-yellow solution for intravenous infusion, which may contain a small amount of visible translucent-to-white, amorphous ipilimumab particulates. It is supplied in single-use vials of 50 mg/10 mL and 200 mg/40 mL. Each milliliter contains 5 mg of ipilimumab and the following inactive ingredients: diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) (0.04 mg), mannitol (10 mg), polysorbate 80 (vegetable origin) (0.1 mg), sodium chloride (5.85 mg), tris hydrochloride (3.15 mg), and Water for Injection, USP at a pH of 7."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ipilimumab was studied in 785 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 doses. The PK of ipilimumab is linear in the dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. Following administration of YERVOY every 3 weeks, the systemic accumulation was 1.5-fold or less. Steady-state concentrations of ipilimumab were reached by the third dose; the mean Cmin at steady state was 19.4 mcg/mL at 3 mg/kg and 58.1 mcg/mL at 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The mean value (percent coefficient of variation) based on population PK analysis for the terminal half-life (t1/2) was 15.4 days (34%) and for clearance (CL) was 16.8 mL/h (38%). YERVOY with nivolumab: When YERVOY 1 mg/kg was administered in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg, the CL of ipilimumab and nivolumab were unchanged compared to when YERVOY was administered alone. When administered in combination, the CL of ipilimumab was unchanged in presence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies and the CL of nivolumab increased by 20% in the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies. Specific Populations The effects of various covariates on the PK of ipilimumab were assessed in population PK analyses. The CL of ipilimumab increased with increasing body weight supporting the recommended body weight (mg/kg) based dosing. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of ipilimumab: age (range: 23 to 88 years), sex, performance status, renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment, previous cancer therapy, and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The effect of race was not examined due to limited data available in non-Caucasian ethnic groups. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the CL of ipilimumab was evaluated in patients with mild (GFR <90 and ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=349), moderate (GFR <60 and ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=82), or severe (GFR <30 and ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=4) renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function (GFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=350) in population PK analyses. No clinically important differences in the CL of ipilimumab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on the CL of ipilimumab was evaluated in patients with mild hepatic impairment (n=76) compared to patients with normal hepatic function (n=708) in the population PK analyses, and no clinically important differences in the CL of ipilimumab were found. YERVOY has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Pediatric Population: [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

        "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of YERVOY have been established in pediatric patients 12 years and older for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma or for the treatment of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Use of YERVOY in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of YERVOY in adults and population pharmacokinetic data demonstrating that the exposure at doses of 3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg in the pediatric and adult populations are comparable. In addition, the tumor biology and course of advanced melanoma and MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older to allow extrapolation of data from adults to pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness for pediatric patients 12 years and older have not been established for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma or for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. In addition, the safety and effectiveness have not been established with YERVOY for any indication in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age. YERVOY was evaluated in a total of 45 pediatric patients across two clinical trials. In a dose-finding trial, 33 pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors were evaluated. The median age was 13 years (range 2 to 21 years), and 20 patients were ≥12 years old. YERVOY was administered at doses of 1, 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg intravenously over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses and then every 12 weeks thereafter until progression or treatment discontinuation. YERVOY was also evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial in 12 pediatric patients ≥12 years old (range 12 to 16 years) with previously treated or untreated, unresectable Stage 3 or 4 malignant melanoma. Patients received YERVOY 3 mg/kg (4 patients) or 10 mg/kg (8 patients) intravenously over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Of the 17 patients ≥12 years of age with melanoma treated with YERVOY across both studies, two patients experienced objective responses including one partial response that was sustained for 16 months. There were no responses in patients with non-melanoma solid tumors. The overall safety profile of YERVOY in children and adolescents was consistent with the safety profile in adults. Pediatric Pharmacokinetics (PK) Based on a population PK analysis using available pooled data from 565 patients from four phase 2 adult studies (N=521) and two pediatric studies (N=44), body weight normalized clearance of ipilimumab is comparable between adult and pediatric patients. In pediatric patients with a dosing regimen of 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the model simulated geometric mean (CV%) steady-state serum peak and trough concentrations of ipilimumab were 65.8 (17.6%) and 20.7 (33.1%) mcg/mL (for 2 to 6 years old), 70.1 (19.6%) and 19.6 (42.9%) mcg/mL (for 6 to <12 years old), and 73.3 (20.6%) and 17.8 (50.8%) mcg/mL (for 12 years and older), which are comparable to those in adult patients."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose-related manner (see Data). The effects of ipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Human IgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier and ipilimumab is an IgG1; therefore, ipilimumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. There is insufficient human data for YERVOY exposure in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. A Pregnancy Safety Surveillance Study has been established to collect information about pregnancies in women who have received YERVOY. Healthcare providers are encouraged to enroll patients or have their patients enroll directly by calling 1-844-593-7869. Data Animal Data In a combined study of embryo-fetal and peri-postnatal development, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received ipilimumab every 3 weeks from the onset of organogenesis in the first trimester through parturition. No treatment-related adverse effects on reproduction were detected during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Beginning in the third trimester, administration of ipilimumab at doses resulting in exposures approximately 2.6 to 7.2 times the human exposure at a dose of 3 mg/kg resulted in dose-related increases in abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and an increased incidence of infant mortality. In addition, developmental abnormalities were identified in the urogenital system of 2 infant monkeys exposed in utero to 30 mg/kg of ipilimumab (7.2 times the AUC in humans at the 3 mg/kg dose). One female infant monkey had unilateral renal agenesis of the left kidney and ureter, and 1 male infant monkey had an imperforate urethra with associated urinary obstruction and subcutaneous scrotal edema. Genetically engineered mice heterozygous for CTLA-4 (CTLA-4+/−), the target for ipilimumab, appeared healthy and gave birth to healthy CTLA-4+/− heterozygous offspring. Mated CTLA-4+/− heterozygous mice also produced offspring deficient in CTLA-4 (homozygous negative, CTLA-4−/−). The CTLA-4−/− homozygous negative offspring appeared healthy at birth, exhibited signs of multiorgan lymphoproliferative disease by 2 weeks of age, and all died by 3 to 4 weeks of age with massive lymphoproliferation and multiorgan tissue destruction."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions [see Boxed Warning]. Immune-mediated adverse reactions: Permanently discontinue for severe reactions. Withhold dose for moderate immune-mediated adverse reactions until return to baseline, improvement to mild severity, or complete resolution, and patient is receiving less than 7.5 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Administer systemic high-dose corticosteroids for severe, persistent, or recurring immune-mediated reactions. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10) • Immune-mediated hepatitis: Evaluate liver function tests before each dose of YERVOY. (5.2) Withhold for moderate and permanently discontinue for severe or life-threatening transaminase or total bilirubin elevation. (5.2) • Immune-mediated endocrinopathies: Monitor clinical chemistries, ACTH level, and thyroid function tests prior to each dose. Evaluate at each visit for signs and symptoms of endocrinopathy. Institute hormone replacement therapy as needed. (5.5) • Immune-mediated pneumonitis: Withhold for moderate and permanently discontinue for severe or life-threatening pneumonitis. (5.6) • Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction: Monitor for changes in renal function. Withhold for moderate or severe and permanently discontinue for life-threatening serum creatinine elevation. (5.7) • Immune-mediated encephalitis: Monitor for changes in neurologic function. Withhold for new-onset moderate to severe neurological signs or symptoms and permanently discontinue for immune-mediated encephalitis. (5.8) • Infusion reactions: Discontinue for severe and life-threatening infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion reactions. (5.9) • Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. (5.11, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Immune-Mediated Enterocolitis/Colitis Immune-mediated enterocolitis, including fatal cases, can occur with YERVOY. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). In symptomatic patients, rule out infectious etiologies and consider endoscopic evaluation for persistent or severe symptoms. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating an infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Addition of an alternative immunosuppressive agent to the corticosteroid therapy, or replacement of the corticosteroid therapy should be considered in corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis if other causes are excluded. Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with severe enterocolitis and initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. In clinical trials, rapid corticosteroid tapering resulted in recurrence or worsening symptoms of enterocolitis in some patients. Consider adding anti-TNF or other immunosuppressant agents for management of immune-mediated enterocolitis unresponsive to systemic corticosteroids within 3 to 5 days or recurring after symptom improvement, if other causes are excluded. Withhold YERVOY dosing for moderate enterocolitis; administer anti-diarrheal treatment and, if persistent for more than 1 week, initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. YERVOY as a Single Agent Metastatic Melanoma In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg in MDX010-20 (NCT00094653), severe, life-threatening, or fatal (diarrhea of 7 or more stools above baseline, fever, ileus, peritoneal signs; Grade 3 to 5) immune-mediated enterocolitis occurred in 34 YERVOY-treated patients (7%), and moderate (diarrhea with up to 6 stools above baseline, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool; Grade 2) enterocolitis occurred in 28 YERVOY-treated patients (5%). Across all YERVOY-treated patients (n=511), 5 patients (1%) developed intestinal perforation, 4 patients (0.8%) died as a result of complications, and 26 patients (5%) were hospitalized for severe enterocolitis. The median time to onset of Grade 3 to 5 enterocolitis was 1.7 months (range: 11 days to 3.1 months) and for Grade 2 enterocolitis was 1.4 months (range: 2 days to 4.3 months). Twenty-nine patients (85%) with Grade 3 to 5 enterocolitis were treated with high-dose (≥40 mg prednisone equivalent per day) corticosteroids, with a median dose of 80 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; the median duration of treatment was 16 days (ranging up to 3.2 months) followed by corticosteroid taper. Of the 28 patients with moderate enterocolitis, 46% were not treated with systemic corticosteroids, 29% were treated with <40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day for a median duration of 1.2 months, and 25% were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days prior to corticosteroid taper. Infliximab was administered to 5 (8%) of the 62 patients with moderate, severe, or life-threatening immune-mediated enterocolitis following inadequate response to corticosteroids. Of the 34 patients with Grade 3 to 5 enterocolitis, 74% experienced complete resolution, 3% experienced improvement to Grade 2 severity, and 24% did not improve. Among the 28 patients with Grade 2 enterocolitis, 79% experienced complete resolution, 11% improved, and 11% did not improve. Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg in CA184-029 (NCT00636168), Grade 3 to 5 immune-mediated enterocolitis occurred in 76 patients (16%) and Grade 2 enterocolitis occurred in 68 patients (14%). Seven patients (1.5%) developed intestinal perforation and 3 patients (0.6%) died as a result of complications [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The median time to onset for Grade 3 to 4 enterocolitis was 1.1 months (range: 1 day to 33.1 months) and for Grade 2 enterocolitis was 1.1 months (range: 1 day to 20.6 months). Seventy-one patients (95%) with Grade 3 to 4 enterocolitis were treated with systemic corticosteroids. The median duration of treatment was 4.7 months (ranging up to 52.3 months). Of the 68 patients with moderate enterocolitis, 51 patients (75%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids with a median duration of treatment of 3.5 months (ranging up to 52.2 months). Non-corticosteroids immunosuppression, consisting almost exclusively of infliximab, was used to treat 36% of patients with Grade 3 to 4 enterocolitis and 15% of patients with a Grade 2 event. Of the 75 patients with Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated enterocolitis, 86% experienced complete resolution, 3% experienced improvement to Grade 1, and 11% did not improve. Among the 68 patients with Grade 2 enterocolitis, 94% experienced complete resolution, 3% experienced improvement to Grade 1, and 3% did not improve. YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 10% (52/547) of patients with RCC and 7% (8/119) of patients with CRC. Median time to onset of immune-mediated colitis was 1.7 months (range: 2 days to 19.2 months) in patients with RCC and 2.4 months (range: 22 days to 5.2 months) in patients with CRC. Immune-mediated colitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 3.2% of patients with RCC or CRC (n=666) and withholding of both YERVOY and nivolumab in 3.9% [see Dosage and Administration (2.5 )]. All patients with colitis required systemic corticosteroids, including 80% who received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 21 days (range: 1 day to 27 months). Approximately 23% of patients with immune-mediated colitis required addition of infliximab to high-dose corticosteroids. Complete resolution occurred in 88% of patients. Two patients with RCC had recurrence of colitis after re-initiation of nivolumab with YERVOY. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Hepatitis Immune-mediated hepatitis, including fatal cases, can occur with YERVOY. Monitor liver function tests (hepatic transaminase and bilirubin levels) and assess patients for signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity before each dose of YERVOY. In patients with hepatotoxicity, rule out infectious or malignant causes and increase frequency of liver function test monitoring until resolution. Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with Grade 3 to 4 hepatotoxicity and administer systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. When liver function tests show sustained improvement or return to baseline, initiate corticosteroid tapering and continue to taper over 1 month. Across the clinical development program for YERVOY, mycophenolate treatment has been administered in patients who have persistent severe hepatitis despite high-dose corticosteroids. Withhold YERVOY in patients with Grade 2 hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. YERVOY as a Single Agent Metastatic Melanoma In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg in MDX010-20, severe, life-threatening, or fatal hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT elevations of more than 5 times the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin elevations more than 3 times the upper limit of normal; Grade 3 to 5) occurred in 8 YERVOY-treated patients (2%), with fatal hepatic failure in 0.2% and hospitalization in 0.4% of YERVOY-treated patients. An additional 13 patients (2.5%) experienced moderate hepatotoxicity manifested by liver function test abnormalities (AST or ALT elevations of more than 2.5 times but not more than 5 times the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin elevation of more than 1.5 times but not more than 3 times the upper limit of normal; Grade 2). The underlying pathology was not ascertained in all patients but in some instances included immune-mediated hepatitis. There were insufficient numbers of patients with biopsy-proven hepatitis to characterize the clinical course of this event. Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg in CA184-029, Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 51 patients (11%) and moderate Grade 2 immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 22 patients (5%). Liver biopsy performed in 6 patients with Grade 3 to 4 hepatitis showed evidence of toxic or autoimmune hepatitis. The median time to onset for Grade 3 to 4 hepatitis was 2.0 months (range: 1 day to 4.2 months) and for Grade 2 hepatitis was 1.4 months (range: 13 days to 6.5 months). Of the 51 patients with Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated hepatitis, 94% experienced complete resolution, 4% experienced improvement to Grade 1, and 2% did not improve. Of the 22 patients with Grade 2 immune-mediated hepatitis, 91% experienced complete resolution and 9% did not improve. Forty-six patients (90%) with Grade 3 to 4 hepatitis were treated with systemic corticosteroids. The median duration of treatment was 4.4 months (ranging up to 56.1 months). Sixteen patients (73%) with moderate hepatitis were treated with systemic corticosteroids. The median duration of treatment was 2.6 months (ranging up to 41.4 months). Concurrent Administration with Vemurafenib In a dose-finding trial, Grade 3 increases in transaminases with or without concomitant increases in total bilirubin occurred in 6 of 10 patients who received concurrent YERVOY (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 mg BID). YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% (38/547) of patients with RCC and 8% (10/119) with CRC. Median time to onset was 2 months (range: 14 days to 26.8 months) in patients with RCC and 2.2 months (range: 22 days to 10.5 months) in patients with CRC. Immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 3.6% of patients with RCC or CRC (n=666) and withholding of both YERVOY and nivolumab in 3.5% [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. All patients with hepatitis required systemic corticosteroids, including 94% who received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 1 month (range: 1 day to 7 months). Approximately 19% of patients with immune-mediated hepatitis required addition of mycophenolic acid to high-dose corticosteroids. Complete resolution occurred in 83% of patients. No patients had recurrence of hepatitis after re-initiation of nivolumab with YERVOY or nivolumab alone. 5.3 Immune-Mediated Dermatitis/Skin Adverse Reactions Immune-mediated dermatitis, including fatal cases, can occur with YERVOY. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of dermatitis, such as rash and pruritus. Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of dermatitis should be considered immune-mediated. Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rash complicated by full thickness dermal ulceration, or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations. Administer systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. When dermatitis is controlled, corticosteroid tapering should occur over a period of at least 1 month. Withhold YERVOY dosing in patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. For mild to moderate dermatitis, such as localized rash and pruritus, treat symptomatically. Administer topical or systemic corticosteroids if there is no improvement of symptoms within 1 week. YERVOY as a Single Agent Metastatic Melanoma In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg in MDX010-20, severe, life-threatening, or fatal immune-mediated dermatitis (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rash complicated by full thickness dermal ulceration, or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations; Grade 3 to 5) occurred in 13 YERVOY-treated patients (2.5%). One patient (0.2%) died as a result of toxic epidermal necrolysis and one additional patient required hospitalization for severe dermatitis. There were 63 patients (12%) with moderate (Grade 2) dermatitis. The median time to onset of moderate, severe, or life-threatening immune-mediated dermatitis was 22 days and ranged up to 4.0 months from the initiation of YERVOY. Seven YERVOY-treated patients (54%) with severe dermatitis received high-dose corticosteroids (median dose 60 mg prednisone/day or equivalent) for up to 3.4 months followed by corticosteroid taper. Of these 7 patients, 6 had complete resolution; time to resolution ranged up to 3.6 months. Of the 63 patients with moderate dermatitis, 25 (40%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids (median of 60 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) for a median of 15 days, 7 (11%) were treated with only topical corticosteroids, and 31 (49%) did not receive systemic or topical corticosteroids. Forty-four patients (70%) with moderate dermatitis were reported to have complete resolution, 7 (11%) improved to mild (Grade 1) severity, and 12 (19%) had no reported improvement. Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg in CA184-029, Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated dermatitis occurred in 19 patients (4%). There were 99 patients (21%) with moderate (Grade 2) dermatitis. The median time to onset for Grade 3 to 4 dermatitis was 14 days (range: 5 days to 11.3 months) and for Grade 2 dermatitis was 11 days (range: 1 day to 16.6 months). Sixteen patients (84%) with Grade 3 to 4 dermatitis were treated with systemic corticosteroids for a median of 21 days (ranging up to 49.2 months) resulting in complete resolution of dermatitis within a median time of 4.3 months (range up to 44.4 months). Of the 3 patients (16%) not treated with systemic or topical corticosteroids, 2 (11%) had complete resolution and 1 had improvement to Grade 1. Of the 99 patients with Grade 2 dermatitis, 67 (68%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids for a median of 2.6 months, 16 (16%) were treated with only topical corticosteroids and 16 (16%) did not receive systemic or topical corticosteroids. Seventy-seven patients (78%) had complete resolution, 15 (15%) improved to mild (Grade 1) severity, and 7 (7%) did not improve. YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Immune-mediated rash occurred in 16% (90/547) of patients with RCC and 14% (17/119) of patients with CRC. Median time to onset was 1.5 months (range: 1 day to 20.9 months) in RCC and 26 days (range: 5 days to 9.8 months) in CRC. Immune-mediated rash led to permanent discontinuation or withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 0.5% of patients with RCC or CRC (n=666) and withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 2.6% of patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. All patients with immune-mediated rash required systemic corticosteroids, including 19% who received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 22 days (range: 1 day to 23 months). Complete resolution occurred in 66% of patients. Immune-mediated rash recurred in approximately 3% (3/98) of patients who resumed nivolumab. 5.4 Immune-Mediated Neuropathies Immune-mediated neuropathies, including fatal cases, can occur with YERVOY. Monitor for symptoms of motor or sensory neuropathy such as unilateral or bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, or paresthesia. Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with severe neuropathy (interfering with daily activities) such as Guillain-Barré-like syndromes. Institute medical intervention as appropriate for management of severe neuropathy. Consider initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent for severe neuropathies. Withhold YERVOY dosing in patients with moderate neuropathy (not interfering with daily activities) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. YERVOY as a Single Agent Metastatic Melanoma In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg in MDX010-20, 1 case of fatal Guillain-Barré syndrome and 1 case of severe (Grade 3) peripheral motor neuropathy were reported. Across the clinical development program of YERVOY, myasthenia gravis and additional cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported. Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg in CA184-029, Grade 3 to 5 immune-mediated neuropathy occurred in 8 patients (2%); the sole fatality was due to complications of Guillain-Barré syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Moderate Grade 2 immune-mediated neuropathy occurred in 1 patient (0.2%). The time to onset across the 9 patients with Grade 2 to 5 immune-mediated neuropathy ranged from 1.4 to 27.4 months. All 8 patients with Grade 3 to 5 neuropathy were treated with systemic corticosteroids (range: 3 days to 38.3 months) and 3 also received tacrolimus. Four of the 8 patients with Grade 3 to 5 immune-mediated neuropathy experienced complete resolution, 1 improved to Grade 1, and 3 did not improve. The single patient with Grade 2 immune-mediated neuropathy experienced complete resolution without the use of corticosteroids. YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Among 547 RCC patients, there were 3 cases of Grade 3 paresthesia/hypoesthesia. 5.5 Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Immune-mediated endocrinopathies, including life-threatening cases, can occur with YERVOY. Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency (including adrenal crisis), and hyper- or hypothyroidism. Patients may present with fatigue, headache, mental status changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific symptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying disease. Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered immune-mediated. Monitor clinical chemistries, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests at the start of treatment, before each dose, and as clinically indicated based on symptoms. In a limited number of patients, hypophysitis was diagnosed by imaging studies through enlargement of the pituitary gland. Withhold YERVOY dosing in symptomatic patients and consider referral to an endocrinologist. Initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent, and initiate appropriate hormone replacement therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. YERVOY as a Single Agent Metastatic Melanoma In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg in MDX010-20, severe to life-threatening immune-mediated endocrinopathies (requiring hospitalization, urgent medical intervention, or interfering with activities of daily living; Grade 3 to 4) occurred in 9 YERVOY-treated patients (1.8%). All 9 patients had hypopituitarism and some had additional concomitant endocrinopathies such as adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. Six of the 9 patients were hospitalized for severe endocrinopathies. Moderate endocrinopathy (requiring hormone replacement or medical intervention; Grade 2) occurred in 12 patients (2.3%) and consisted of hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, and 1 case each of hyperthyroidism and Cushing’s syndrome. The median time to onset of moderate to severe immune-mediated endocrinopathy was 2.5 months and ranged up to 4.4 months after the initiation of YERVOY. Of the 21 patients with moderate to life-threatening endocrinopathy, 17 patients required long-term hormone replacement therapy including, most commonly, adrenal hormones (n=10) and thyroid hormones (n=13). Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg in CA184-029, Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated endocrinopathies occurred in 39 patients (8%) and Grade 2 immune-mediated endocrinopathies in 93 patients (20%). Of the 39 patients with Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated endocrinopathies, 35 patients had hypopituitarism (associated with one or more secondary endocrinopathies, e.g., adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism), 3 patients had hyperthyroidism, and 1 had primary hypothyroidism. The median time to onset of Grade 3 to 4 immune-mediated endocrinopathy was 2.2 months (range: 2 days to 8 months). Twenty-seven of the 39 patients (69%) were hospitalized for immune-mediated endocrinopathies, and 4 patients (10%) were reported to have resolution. Of the 93 patients with Grade 2 immune-mediated endocrinopathy, 74 had primary hypopituitarism (associated with one or more secondary endocrinopathy, e.g., adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism), 9 had primary hypothyroidism, 3 had hyperthyroidism, 3 had thyroiditis with hypo- or hyperthyroidism, 2 had hypogonadism, 1 had both hyperthyroidism and hypopituitarism, and 1 subject developed Graves’ ophthalmopathy. The median time to onset of Grade 2 immune-mediated endocrinopathy was 2.1 months (range: 9 days to 19.3 months), and 20% were reported to have resolution. One hundred twenty-four patients received systemic corticosteroids as immunosuppression and/or adrenal hormone replacement for Grade 2 to 4 immune-mediated endocrinopathy. Of these, 42 (34%) were able to discontinue corticosteroids. Seventy-three patients received thyroid hormones for treatment of Grade 2 to 4 immune-mediated hypothyroidism. Of these, 14 patients (19%) were able to discontinue thyroid replacement therapy. YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 4.6% (25/547) of patients with RCC and 3.4% (4/119) of patients with CRC. Median time to onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.3 months to 7.3 months) in patients with RCC and 3.7 months (range: 2.8 to 5.5 months) in patients with CRC. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation or withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 1.2% and 2.6% of patients with RCC or CRC (n=666), respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Approximately 72% of patients with hypophysitis received hormone replacement therapy and 55% received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 13 days (range: 1 day to 1.6 months). Adrenal Insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 7% (41/547) of patients with RCC and 5.9% (7/119) patients with CRC. Median time to onset was 3.4 months (range: 2.0 months to 22.3 months) in RCC and 3.7 months (range: 2.5 to 13.4 months) in CRC. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 1.2% of patients with RCC or CRC (n=666) and withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 2.6% [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Approximately 94% of patients with adrenal insufficiency received hormone replacement therapy and 27% received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 12 days (range: 2 days to 5.6 months). Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism or thyroiditis resulting in hypothyroidism occurred in 22% (119/547) of patients with RCC and 15% (18/119) of patients with CRC. Median time to onset was 2.2 months (range: 1 day to 21.4 months) in patients with RCC and 2.3 months (range: 22 days to 9.8 months) in patients with CRC. Of the 137 patients with RCC or CRC who developed hypothyroidism, approximately 81% of patients with RCC and 78% with CRC received levothyroxine. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 12% (66/547) of patients with RCC and 12% (14/119) of patients with CRC. Median time to onset was 1.4 months (range: 6 days to 14.2 months) in RCC and 1.1 months (range: 21 days to 5.4 months) in CRC. Of the 80 patients with RCC or CRC who developed hyperthyroidism, approximately 15% received methimazole and 2% received carbimazole. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Diabetes occurred in 2.7% (15/547) of patients with RCC. Median time to onset was 3.2 months (range: 19 days to 16.8 months). Both YERVOY and nivolumab were withheld in 33% of patients and both were permanently discontinued in 20% of patients who developed diabetes [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 5.6 Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis Immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases, can occur with nivolumab with YERVOY. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and for symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for moderate (Grade 2) or more severe (Grade 3-4) pneumonitis, followed by corticosteroid taper. Withhold YERVOY dosing in patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms. Permanently discontinue YERVOY for life-threatening (Grade 4) pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% (24/547) of patients with RCC and 1.7% (2/119) of patients with CRC. Median time to onset of immune-mediated pneumonitis was 2.6 months (range: 8 days to 9.2 months) in patients with RCC and 1.9 months (range: 27 days to 3 months) in patients with CRC. Immune-mediated pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 1.8% of patients with RCC or CRC (n=666) and withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 1.7% [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. All patients with pneumonitis required systemic corticosteroids, including 92% who received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 19 days (range: 4 days to 3.2 months). Approximately 8% required addition of infliximab to high-dose corticosteroids. Complete resolution of pneumonitis occurred in 81% of patients. 5.7 Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction Immune-mediated nephritis can occur with nivolumab with YERVOY. Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by corticosteroid taper for life-threatening (Grade 4) increased serum creatinine. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) increased serum creatinine, if worsening or no improvement occurs, increase dose of corticosteroids to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents. Withhold YERVOY dosing in patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms. Permanently discontinue YERVOY for life-threatening (Grade 4) increased serum creatinine [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction occurred in 4.6% (25/547) of patients with RCC and 1.7% (2/119) of patients with CRC. Median time to onset was 3 months (range: 1 day to 13.2 months) among these 27 patients. Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 1.2% of patients with RCC or CRC (n=666) and withholding of nivolumab and YERVOY in 2.3% of patients with RCC or CRC [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Approximately 78% of patients with immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 17 days (range: 1 day to 6 months). Complete resolution occurred in 63% of patients. 5.8 Immune-Mediated Encephalitis Immune-mediated encephalitis can occur with YERVOY. Evaluation of patients with neurologic symptoms may include, but not be limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Withhold YERVOY in patients with new-onset moderate to severe neurologic signs or symptoms and evaluate to rule out infectious or other causes of moderate to severe neurologic deterioration. If other etiologies are ruled out, administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for patients with immune-mediated encephalitis, followed by corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue YERVOY for immune-mediated encephalitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Encephalitis occurred in one patient (0.2%) with RCC approximately 4 months after initiation of YERVOY and in one patient (0.8%) with CRC 15 days after initiation of YERVOY. The patient with CRC required infliximab and high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day). 5.9 Infusion Reactions Severe infusion reactions can occur with nivolumab with YERVOY. Discontinue YERVOY in patients with severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients with RCC and 4.2% (5/119) of patients with CRC. 5.10 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions YERVOY as a Single Agent Permanently discontinue YERVOY for clinically significant or severe immune-mediated adverse reactions. Initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent for severe immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of ocular toxicity, which may include blurred vision and reduced visual acuity. Immune-mediated ocular toxicity may be associated with retinal detachment or permanent vision loss. Administer corticosteroid eye drops to patients who develop uveitis, iritis, or episcleritis. Permanently discontinue YERVOY for immune-mediated ocular disease that is unresponsive to local immunosuppressive therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving YERVOY and may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Fatal or serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can occur in patients who receive a CTLA-4 receptor blocking antibody either before or after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Follow patients closely for evidence of GVHD and intervene promptly. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2).] Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a CTLA-4 receptor blocking antibody after allogeneic HSCT. Metastatic Melanoma In MDX010-20, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions were seen in less than 1% of YERVOY-treated patients: cytopenias, nephritis, pneumonitis, meningitis, pericarditis, uveitis, and iritis. Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma In CA184-029, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions were seen in less than 1% of YERVOY-treated patients unless specified: cytopenias, eosinophilia (2.1%), pancreatitis (1.3%), meningitis, pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, pericarditis, uveitis, and fatal myocarditis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Other Clinical Experience Across 21 dose-ranging trials administering YERVOY at doses of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg (n=2478), the following likely immune-mediated adverse reactions were also reported with less than 1% incidence unless specified: angiopathy, temporal arteritis, vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, episcleritis, scleritis, iritis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, erythema multiforme, psoriasis, arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, neurosensory hypoacusis, autoimmune central neuropathy (encephalitis), myositis, polymyositis, ocular myositis, cytopenias (2.5%), and nephritis. YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg YERVOY can cause other clinically significant and potentially fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur after discontinuation of YERVOY therapy. For any suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, permanently discontinue or withhold YERVOY, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider restarting YERVOY after completion of corticosteroid taper based on the severity of the event. Across clinical trials of YERVOY administered with nivolumab or in trials of nivolumab administered as a single agent, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in less than 1.0% of patients: myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, uveitis, iritis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, hypopituitarism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, gastritis, duodenitis, sarcoidosis, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), motor dysfunction, vasculitis, aplastic anemia, pericarditis, and myasthenic syndrome. 5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose-related manner. The effects of ipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with a YERVOY-containing regimen and for 3 months after the last dose of YERVOY [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.12 Risks Associated When Administered in Combination with Nivolumab When YERVOY is administered in combination with nivolumab, refer to the nivolumab prescribing information for additional risk information that applies to the combination use."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling. •Immune-mediated enterocolitis/colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. •Immune-mediated hepatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. •Immune-mediated dermatitis/skin adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. •Immune-mediated neuropathies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. •Immune-mediated endocrinopathies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. •Immune-mediated pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. •Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. •Immune-mediated encephalitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. •Infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. •Other immune-mediated adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. •Embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. In patients receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in MDX010-20, 15% of patients receiving monotherapy and 12% of patients treated in combination with gp100 peptide vaccine experienced Grade 3 to 5 immune-mediated reactions. In patients receiving YERVOY 10 mg/kg for adjuvant treatment of melanoma in CA184-029, 41% experienced Grade 3 to 5 immune-mediated reactions. Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) with YERVOY as a single agent are fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, rash, and colitis. Additional common adverse reactions at the 10 mg/kg dose (≥5%) include nausea, vomiting, headache, weight loss, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and insomnia. (6.1) Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with YERVOY in combination with nivolumab are fatigue, rash, diarrhea, nausea, pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, abdominal pain, vomiting, cough, arthralgia, decreased appetite, dyspnea.

The data described below reflect exposure to YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a single agent in MDX010-20, a randomized trial in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma; to YERVOY 10 mg/kg as a single agent in CA184-029, a randomized trial in patients with resected Stage IIIA (>1 mm nodal involvement), IIIB, and IIIC (with no in-transit metastases) cutaneous melanoma; and to YERVOY 1 mg/kg, administered in combination with nivolumab, in two trials: CHECKMATE-214 (NCT02231749), a randomized trial in previously untreated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, and CHECKMATE-142 (NCT02060188), an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized multiple parallel cohort trial in patients with previously treated, MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer. Clinically significant adverse reactions were evaluated in a total of 982 patients treated in MDX010-20 and CA184-029 and in 21 dose-ranging trials (n=2478) administering YERVOY at doses of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The safety of YERVOY was evaluated in MDX010-20, a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in which 643 previously treated patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma received YERVOY 3 mg/kg for 4 doses given by intravenous infusion as a single agent (n=131), YERVOY with an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine (gp100) (n=380), or gp100 peptide vaccine as a single agent (n=132) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients in the trial received a median of 4 doses (range: 1 to 4 doses). MDX010-20 excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation. The trial population characteristics were: median age 57 years (range: 19 to 90), 59% male, 94% white, and baseline ECOG performance status 0 (56%). YERVOY was discontinued for adverse reactions in 10% of patients. Table 2 presents selected adverse reactions from MDX010-20, which occurred in at least 5% of patients in the YERVOY-containing arms and with at least 5% increased incidence over the control gp100 arm for all-grade events and at least 1% incidence over the control group for Grade 3 to 5 events.

In this trial, 36% of patients received YERVOY for longer than 6 months and 26% of patients received YERVOY for longer than 1 year. YERVOY-treated patients in the trial received a median of 4 doses (range: 1 to 16). CA184-029 excluded patients with prior systemic therapy for melanoma, autoimmune disease, a condition requiring systemic immunosuppression, or a positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV. The trial population characteristics were: median age 51 years (range: 18 to 84 years), 62% male, 99% white, and baseline ECOG performance status 0 (94%). YERVOY was discontinued for adverse reactions in 52% of patients.

Previously Untreated Renal Cell Carcinoma The safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg, administered with YERVOY 1 mg/kg was evaluated in CHECKMATE-214, a randomized open-label trial in which 1082 patients with previously untreated advanced RCC received nivolumab 3 mg/kg in combination with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab monotherapy at the 3 mg/kg dose (n=547) every 2 weeks or sunitinib administered orally 50 mg daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, every cycle (n=535) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The median duration of treatment was 7.9 months (range: 1 day to 21.4+ months) in nivolumab plus YERVOY-treated patients and 7.8 months (range: 1 day to 20.2+ months) in sunitinib-treated patients. In this trial, 57% of patients in the nivolumab plus YERVOY arm were exposed to treatment for greater than 6 months, and 38% of patients were exposed to treatment for greater than 1 year. Study therapy was discontinued for adverse reactions in 31% of nivolumab plus YERVOY patients and in 21% of sunitinib patients. Fifty-four percent (54%) of patients receiving nivolumab plus YERVOY and 43% of patients receiving sunitinib had a drug delay for an adverse reaction. In the sunitinib group, 53% of patients required a dose reduction; dose reductions were not permitted in the nivolumab plus YERVOY treatment group. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients receiving nivolumab plus YERVOY and in 43% of patients receiving sunitinib. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients treated with nivolumab plus YERVOY were diarrhea, pyrexia, pneumonia, pneumonitis, hypophysitis, acute kidney injury, dyspnea, adrenal insufficiency, and colitis; in patients treated with sunitinib, they were pneumonia, pleural effusion, and dyspnea. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of nivolumab plus YERVOY-treated patients) were fatigue, rash, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, nausea, cough, pyrexia, arthralgia, vomiting, dyspnea, and decreased appetite.

Previously Treated MSI-H or dMMR Metastatic Colorectal Cancer The safety of YERVOY was evaluated in CHECKMATE-142, an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, multiple parallel-cohort study. In CHECKMATE-142, 119 patients with previously treated MSI-H or dMMR mCRC received YERVOY, in combination with nivolumab, in a single-arm cohort. In another single-arm cohort under CHECKMATE-142, 74 patients with mCRC received nivolumab monotherapy. All patients in both cohorts had received prior fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Of those in the YERVOY plus nivolumab cohort, 69% had received prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, and 29% had received an anti-EGFR antibody. Patients in the YERVOY plus nivolumab cohort received YERVOY 1 mg/kg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 doses, then nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in the nivolumab single agent cohort received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [See Clinical Studies (14.4)]. The median duration of exposure for YERVOY was 2.1 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 47% of YERVOY-treated patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were colitis/diarrhea, hepatic events, abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, pyrexia, and dehydration. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of YERVOY-treated patients) were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, pruritus, nausea, rash, decreased appetite, and vomiting. Table 9 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 10% of patients receiving YERVOY. Table 10 summarizes laboratory tests that worsened from baseline in greater than 10% of patients receiving YERVOY. Based on the design of CHECKMATE-142, the data summarized below cannot be used to identify statistically significant differences between the two cohorts for any adverse reaction.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: graft-versus-host disease Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome) 6.3 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ipilimumab in the studies described below with the incidences of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Eleven (1.1%) of 1024 evaluable patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma tested positive for treatment-emergent binding antibodies against ipilimumab (TE-ADAs) in an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. This assay had substantial limitations in detecting anti-ipilimumab antibodies in the presence of ipilimumab. Seven (4.9%) of 144 patients receiving ipilimumab and 7 (4.5%) of 156 patients receiving placebo for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma tested positive for TE-ADAs using an ECL assay with improved drug tolerance. No patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. No infusion-related reactions occurred in patients who tested positive for TE-ADAs. Of 499 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-214 and CHECKMATE-142, 27 (5.4%) were positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies; there were no patients with neutralizing antibodies against ipilimumab. There was no evidence of increased incidence of infusion reactions to YERVOY in patients with anti-ipilimumab antibodies. Of 503 patients evaluable for anti-nivolumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-214 and CHECKMATE-142 trials, 126 (25%) were positive for anti-nivolumab antibodies and 3 (0.6%) were positive for neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab."

In animal reproduction studies, administration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose-related manner (see Data). The effects of ipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Human IgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier and ipilimumab is an IgG1; therefore, ipilimumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. There is insufficient human data for YERVOY exposure in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. A Pregnancy Safety Surveillance Study has been established to collect information about pregnancies in women who have received YERVOY. Healthcare providers are encouraged to enroll patients or have their patients enroll directly by calling 1-844-593-7869. Data Animal Data In a combined study of embryo-fetal and peri-postnatal development, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received ipilimumab every 3 weeks from the onset of organogenesis in the first trimester through parturition. No treatment-related adverse effects on reproduction were detected during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Beginning in the third trimester, administration of ipilimumab at doses resulting in exposures approximately 2.6 to 7.2 times the human exposure at a dose of 3 mg/kg resulted in dose-related increases in abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and an increased incidence of infant mortality. In addition, developmental abnormalities were identified in the urogenital system of 2 infant monkeys exposed in utero to 30 mg/kg of ipilimumab (7.2 times the AUC in humans at the 3 mg/kg dose). One female infant monkey had unilateral renal agenesis of the left kidney and ureter, and 1 male infant monkey had an imperforate urethra with associated urinary obstruction and subcutaneous scrotal edema. Genetically engineered mice heterozygous for CTLA-4 (CTLA-4+/−), the target for ipilimumab, appeared healthy and gave birth to healthy CTLA-4+/− heterozygous offspring. Mated CTLA-4+/− heterozygous mice also produced offspring deficient in CTLA-4 (homozygous negative, CTLA-4−/−). The CTLA-4−/− homozygous negative offspring appeared healthy at birth, exhibited signs of multiorgan lymphoproliferative disease by 2 weeks of age, and all died by 3 to 4 weeks of age with massive lymphoproliferation and multiorgan tissue destruction. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether YERVOY is present in human milk. In monkeys, ipilimumab was present in milk (see Data). There are no data to assess the effects of YERVOY on milk production. Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the final dose. Data In monkeys treated at dose levels resulting in exposures 2.6 and 7.2 times higher than those in humans at a 3 mg/kg dose, ipilimumab was present in milk at concentrations of 0.1 mcg/mL and 0.4 mcg/mL, representing a ratio of up to 0.3% of the steady-state serum concentration of the drug. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Based on its mechanism of action, YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the last dose of YERVOY. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of YERVOY have been established in pediatric patients 12 years and older for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma or for the treatment of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Use of YERVOY in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of YERVOY in adults and population pharmacokinetic data demonstrating that the exposure at doses of 3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg in the pediatric and adult populations are comparable. In addition, the tumor biology and course of advanced melanoma and MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older to allow extrapolation of data from adults to pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness for pediatric patients 12 years and older have not been established for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma or for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. In addition, the safety and effectiveness have not been established with YERVOY for any indication in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age. YERVOY was evaluated in a total of 45 pediatric patients across two clinical trials. In a dose-finding trial, 33 pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors were evaluated. The median age was 13 years (range 2 to 21 years), and 20 patients were ≥12 years old. YERVOY was administered at doses of 1, 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg intravenously over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses and then every 12 weeks thereafter until progression or treatment discontinuation. YERVOY was also evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial in 12 pediatric patients ≥12 years old (range 12 to 16 years) with previously treated or untreated, unresectable Stage 3 or 4 malignant melanoma. Patients received YERVOY 3 mg/kg (4 patients) or 10 mg/kg (8 patients) intravenously over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Of the 17 patients ≥12 years of age with melanoma treated with YERVOY across both studies, two patients experienced objective responses including one partial response that was sustained for 16 months. There were no responses in patients with non-melanoma solid tumors. The overall safety profile of YERVOY in children and adolescents was consistent with the safety profile in adults. Pediatric Pharmacokinetics (PK) Based on a population PK analysis using available pooled data from 565 patients from four phase 2 adult studies (N=521) and two pediatric studies (N=44), body weight normalized clearance of ipilimumab is comparable between adult and pediatric patients. In pediatric patients with a dosing regimen of 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the model simulated geometric mean (CV%) steady-state serum peak and trough concentrations of ipilimumab were 65.8 (17.6%) and 20.7 (33.1%) mcg/mL (for 2 to 6 years old), 70.1 (19.6%) and 19.6 (42.9%) mcg/mL (for 6 to <12 years old), and 73.3 (20.6%) and 17.8 (50.8%) mcg/mL (for 12 years and older), which are comparable to those in adult patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 511 patients treated with YERVOY in MDX010-20 (unresectable or metastatic melanoma), 28% were 65 years and over. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were reported between the elderly patients (65 years and over) and younger patients (less than 65 years). CA184-029 (adjuvant treatment of melanoma) and CHECKMATE-142 (metastatic colorectal cancer) did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Of the 550 patients randomized to nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered with YERVOY 1 mg/kg in CHECKMATE-214 (renal cell carcinoma), 38% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between elderly patients and younger patients. In elderly patients with intermediate or poor risk, no overall difference in effectiveness was reported. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin [TB] >1.0 to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] or AST >ULN). YERVOY has not been studied in patients with moderate (TB >1.5 to 3.0 times ULN and any AST) or severe (TB >3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The safety and efficacy of YERVOY were investigated in a randomized (3:1:1), double-blind, double-dummy trial (MDX010-20, NCT00094653) that included 676 randomized patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma previously treated with one or more of the following: aldesleukin, dacarbazine, temozolomide, fotemustine, or carboplatin. Of these 676 patients, 403 were randomized to receive YERVOY at 3 mg/kg in combination with an investigational peptide vaccine with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (gp100), 137 were randomized to receive YERVOY at 3 mg/kg, and 136 were randomized to receive gp100 as a single agent. The trial enrolled only patients with HLA-A2*0201 genotype; this HLA genotype facilitates the immune presentation of the investigational peptide vaccine. The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation. YERVOY/placebo was administered at 3 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Gp100/placebo was administered at a dose of 2 mg peptide by deep subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Assessment of tumor response was conducted at weeks 12 and 24, and every 3 months thereafter. Patients with evidence of objective tumor response at 12 or 24 weeks had assessment for confirmation of durability of response at 16 or 28 weeks, respectively. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) in the YERVOY plus gp100 arm compared to that in the single-agent gp100 arm. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were OS in the YERVOY plus gp100 arm compared to the YERVOY arm, OS in the YERVOY arm compared to the gp100 arm, best overall response rate (BORR) at week 24 between each of the trial arms, and duration of response. Of the randomized patients, 61%, 59%, and 54% in the YERVOY plus gp100, YERVOY, and gp100 arms, respectively, were men. Twenty-nine percent were ≥65 years of age, the median age was 57 years, 71% had M1c stage, 12% had a history of previously treated brain metastasis, 98% had ECOG performance status of 0 and 1, 23% had received aldesleukin, and 38% had elevated LDH level. Sixty-one percent of patients randomized to either YERVOY-containing arm received all 4 planned doses. The median duration of follow-up was 8.9 months. The OS results are shown in Table 11 and Figure 1. Table 11: Overall Survival Results a Not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

The median duration of response was 11.5 months in the YERVOY plus gp100 arm and has not been reached in the YERVOY or gp100 arm. Figure 1 14.2 Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma The safety and efficacy of YERVOY for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma were investigated in CA184-029 (NCT00636168), a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with resected Stage IIIA (>1 mm nodal involvement), IIIB, and IIIC (with no in-transit metastases) histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma. Patients were randomized to receive YERVOY 10 mg/kg or placebo as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by YERVOY 10 mg/kg or placebo every 12 weeks from Week 24 to Week 156 (3 years) or until documented disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Enrollment required complete resection of melanoma with full lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to randomization. Patients with prior therapy for melanoma, autoimmune disease, and prior or concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by stage according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2002 classification (Stage IIIA >1 mm nodal involvement, Stage IIIB, Stage IIIC with 1 to 3 involved lymph nodes, and Stage IIIC with ≥4 involved lymph nodes) and by region (North America, Europe, and Australia). The major efficacy outcome measures were independent review committee (IRC)-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS), defined as the time between the date of randomization and the earliest date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis) or death, and overall survival. Tumor assessment was conducted every 12 weeks for the first 3 years then every 24 weeks until distant recurrence. Among 951 patients enrolled, 475 were randomized to receive YERVOY and 476 to placebo. Median age was 51 years old (range: 18 to 84), 62% were male, 99% were white, 94% had ECOG performance status of 0. With regard to disease stage, 20% had Stage IIIA with lymph nodes >1 mm, 44% had Stage IIIB, and 36% had Stage IIIC (with no in-transit metastases). Other disease characteristics of the trial population were: clinically palpable lymph nodes (58%), 2 or more positive lymph nodes (54%), and ulcerated primary lesions (42%). The efficacy results are in Table 12 and in Figure 2. Table 12: Efficacy Results in CA184-029 a Stratified by disease stage.

Patients were included regardless of their PD-L1 status. CHECKMATE-214 excluded patients with any history of or concurrent brain metastases, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients were stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) prognostic score and region. Efficacy was evaluated in intermediate/poor-risk patients with at least 1 or more of 6 prognostic risk factors as per the IMDC criteria (less than one year from time of initial renal cell carcinoma diagnosis to randomization, Karnofsky performance status <80%, hemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, corrected calcium of greater than 10 mg/dL, platelet count greater than the upper limit of normal, and absolute neutrophil count greater than the upper limit of normal). Patients were randomized to nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus YERVOY 1 mg/kg (n=425) administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg every two weeks or to sunitinib (n=422) administered orally 50 mg daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off, every cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was 61 years (range: 21 to 85) with 38% ≥65 years of age and 8% ≥75 years of age. The majority of patients were male (73%) and white (87%) and 26% and 74% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70% to 80% and 90% to 100%, respectively. The major efficacy outcome measures were OS, PFS (IRRC-assessed), and confirmed ORR (IRRC-assessed) in intermediate/poor-risk patients. In this population, the trial demonstrated statistically significant improvement in OS and ORR for patients randomized to nivolumab plus YERVOY as compared with sunitinib (Table 13 and Figure 3). OS benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS.

These patients were not evaluated as part of the efficacy analysis population. OS in favorable risk patients receiving nivolumab plus YERVOY compared to sunitinib has a hazard ratio of 1.45 (95% CI: 0.75, 2.81). The efficacy of nivolumab plus YERVOY in previously untreated renal cell carcinoma with favorable risk disease has not been established. Figure 3 14.4 Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) or Mismatch Repair Deficient (dMMR) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer CHECKMATE-142 (NCT02060188) was a multicenter, non-randomized, multiple parallel-cohort, open-label study conducted in patients with locally determined dMMR or MSI-H metastatic CRC (mCRC) who had disease progression during or after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, or irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Key eligibility criteria were at least one prior line of treatment for metastatic disease, ECOG PS 0 or 1, and absence of the following: active brain metastases, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients enrolled in the YERVOY and nivolumab MSI-H mCRC cohort received YERVOY 1 mg/kg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV as a single agent every 2 weeks. Patients enrolled in the single-agent nivolumab MSI-H mCRC cohort received nivolumab 3 mg/kg by intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 weeks. Treatment in both cohorts continued until unacceptable toxicity or radiographic progression. Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. Efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by independent radiographic review committee (IRRC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) and duration of response (DOR). A total of 119 patients were enrolled in the YERVOY plus nivolumab cohort. The median age was 58 years (range: 21 to 88), with 32% ≥65 years of age and 9% ≥75 years of age; 59% were male and 92% were white. Baseline ECOG PS was 0 (45%) or 1 (55%), and 29% were reported to have Lynch Syndrome. Across the cohort, 69% received prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan; 10%, 40%, 24%, and 15% received 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease, respectively, and 29% had received an anti-EGFR antibody. A total of 74 patients were enrolled in the single-agent nivolumab cohort. The median age was 53 years (range: 26 to 79) with 23% ≥65 years of age and 5% ≥75 years of age, 59% were male and 88% were white. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (43%), 1 (55%), or 3 (1.4%), and 36% were reported to have Lynch Syndrome. Across the 74 patients, 72% received prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan; 7%, 30%, 28%, 19%, and 16% received 0, 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease, respectively, and 42% of patients had received an anti-EGFR antibody. Efficacy results are shown in Table 14.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ipilimumab was studied in 785 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 doses. The PK of ipilimumab is linear in the dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. Following administration of YERVOY every 3 weeks, the systemic accumulation was 1.5-fold or less. Steady-state concentrations of ipilimumab were reached by the third dose; the mean Cmin at steady state was 19.4 mcg/mL at 3 mg/kg and 58.1 mcg/mL at 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The mean value (percent coefficient of variation) based on population PK analysis for the terminal half-life (t1/2) was 15.4 days (34%) and for clearance (CL) was 16.8 mL/h (38%). YERVOY with nivolumab: When YERVOY 1 mg/kg was administered in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg, the CL of ipilimumab and nivolumab were unchanged compared to when YERVOY was administered alone. When administered in combination, the CL of ipilimumab was unchanged in presence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies and the CL of nivolumab increased by 20% in the presence of anti-nivolumab antibodies. Specific Populations The effects of various covariates on the PK of ipilimumab were assessed in population PK analyses. The CL of ipilimumab increased with increasing body weight supporting the recommended body weight (mg/kg) based dosing. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of ipilimumab: age (range: 23 to 88 years), sex, performance status, renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment, previous cancer therapy, and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The effect of race was not examined due to limited data available in non-Caucasian ethnic groups. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the CL of ipilimumab was evaluated in patients with mild (GFR <90 and ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=349), moderate (GFR <60 and ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=82), or severe (GFR <30 and ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=4) renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function (GFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=350) in population PK analyses. No clinically important differences in the CL of ipilimumab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on the CL of ipilimumab was evaluated in patients with mild hepatic impairment (n=76) compared to patients with normal hepatic function (n=708) in the population PK analyses, and no clinically important differences in the CL of ipilimumab were found. YERVOY has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Pediatric Population: [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."
