        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage: Monitor for bleeding and manage appropriately. ( 5.1 ) Infections: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection, including opportunistic infections, and treat as needed. ( 5.2 ) Cytopenias: Monitor complete blood counts during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Second Primary Malignancies: Other malignancies have occurred in patients including skin cancers. Advise patients to use sun protection. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Arrhythmias: Monitor for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage appropriately. ( 5.5 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Fatal and serious hemorrhagic events have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria and hemothorax have been reported in 3.4% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Hemorrhage events of any grade, excluding purpura and petechiae, occurred in 35% of patients. Bleeding events have occurred in patients with and without concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Co-administration of BRUKINSA with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications may further increase the risk of hemorrhage. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Discontinue BRUKINSA if intracranial hemorrhage of any grade occurs. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding BRUKINSA for 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding. 5.2 Infections Fatal and serious infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) and opportunistic infections have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 27% of patients, most commonly pneumonia. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation have occurred. Consider prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and other infections according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever or other signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately. 5.3 Cytopenias Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (26%), thrombocytopenia (11%) and anemia (8%) based on laboratory measurements, developed in patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 13% of patients, and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 3.6% of patients. Monitor complete blood counts regularly during treatment and interrupt treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue treatment as warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Treat using growth factor or transfusions, as needed. 5.4 Second Primary Malignancies Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinoma, have occurred in 14% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer reported in 8% of patients. Other second primary malignancies included malignant solid tumors (4.0%), melanoma (1.7%) and hematologic malignancies (1.2%). Advise patients to use sun protection and monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. 5.5 Cardiac Arrhythmias Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter were reported in 3.2% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension and acute infections may be at increased risk. Grade 3 or higher events were reported in 1.1% of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy. Monitor signs and symptoms for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage as appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals, BRUKINSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity, including malformations at exposures that were 5 times higher than those reported in patients at the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking BRUKINSA and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise men to avoid fathering a child during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Cytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Second Primary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Cardiac Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions (≥30%) include neutrophil count decreased, upper respiratory tract infection, platelet count decreased, hemorrhage, lymphocyte count decreased, rash and musculoskeletal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact BeiGene at 1-877-828-5596 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to BRUKINSA in seven clinical trials, administered as a single agent at 160 mg twice daily in 730 patients, at 320 mg once daily in 105 patients, and at 40 mg to 160 mg once daily (0.125 to 0.5 times the recommended dosage) in 12 patients. Among 847 patients receiving BRUKINSA, 73% were exposed for at least 1 year, 57% were exposed for at least 2 years and 26% were exposed for at least 3 years. In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, in ≥ 30% of patients included neutrophil count decreased (54%), upper respiratory tract infection (47%), platelet count decreased (41%), hemorrhage (35%), lymphocyte count decreased (31%), rash (31%) and musculoskeletal pain (30%). Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) The safety of BRUKINSA was evaluated in 118 patients with MCL who received at least one prior therapy in two single-arm clinical trials, BGB-3111-206 [NCT03206970] and BGB-3111-AU-003 [NCT02343120] [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The median age of patients who received BRUKINSA in studies BGB-3111-206 and BGB-3111-AU-003 was 62 years (range: 34 to 86), 75% were male, 75% were Asian, 21% were White, and 94% had an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1. Patients had a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (range: 1 to 4). The BGB-3111-206 trial required a platelet count ≥ 75 × 10 9 /L and an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L independent of growth factor support, hepatic enzymes ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN. The BGB-3111-AU-003 trial required a platelet count ≥ 50 × 10 9 /L and an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L independent of growth factor support, hepatic enzymes ≤ 3 × upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN. Both trials required a CLcr ≥ 30 mL/min. Both trials excluded patients with prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, exposure to a BTK inhibitor, known infection with HIV and serologic evidence of active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection and patients requiring strong CYP3A inhibitors or strong CYP3A inducers. Patients received BRUKINSA 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily. Among patients receiving BRUKINSA, 79% were exposed for 6 months or longer, and 68% were exposed for greater than one year. Fatal events within 30 days of the last dose of BRUKINSA occurred in 8 (7%) of 118 patients with MCL. Fatal cases included pneumonia in 2 patients and cerebral hemorrhage in one patient. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 36 patients (31%). The most frequent serious adverse reactions that occurred were pneumonia (11%) and hemorrhage (5%). Of the 118 patients with MCL treated with BRUKINSA, 8 (7%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the trials. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was pneumonia (3.4%). One (0.8%) patient experienced an adverse reaction leading to dose reduction (hepatitis B).

Cohort 1 included 199 patients with MYD88 mutation ( MYD88 MUT ) WM, randomized to and treated with either BRUKINSA (101 patients) or ibrutinib (98 patients). The trial also included a non-randomized arm, Cohort 2, with 26 wild type MYD88 ( MYD88 WT ) WM patients and 2 patients with unknown MYD88 status [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Among patients who received BRUKINSA, 93% were exposed for 6 months or longer, and 89% were exposed for greater than 1 year. In Cohort 1 of the ASPEN study safety population (N=101), the median age of patients who received BRUKINSA was 70 years (45-87 years old); 67% were male, 86% were White, 4% were Asian and 10% were not reported (unknown race). In Cohort 2 of the ASPEN study safety population (N=28), the median age of patients who received BRUKINSA was 72 (39-87 years old); 50% were male, 96% were White and 4% were not reported (unknown race). In Cohort 1, serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients who received BRUKINSA. Serious adverse reactions in > 2% of patients included influenza (3%), pneumonia (4%), neutropenia and neutrophil count decreased (3%), hemorrhage (4%), pyrexia (3%) and febrile neutropenia (3%). In Cohort 2, serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients. Serious adverse reactions in > 2 patients included pneumonia (14%). Permanent discontinuation of BRUKINSA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2% of patients in Cohort 1 and included hemorrhage (1 patient), neutropenia and neutrophil count decreased (1 patient); in Cohort 2, permanent discontinuation of BRUKINSA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 7% of patients and included subdural hemorrhage (1 patient) and diarrhea (1 patient). Dosage interruptions of BRUKINSA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 32% of patients in Cohort 1 and in 29% in Cohort 2. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in > 2% of patients included neutropenia, vomiting, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia and pneumonia in Cohort 1. Adverse reactions leading to dosage interruption in > 2 patients in Cohort 2 included pneumonia and pyrexia. Dose reductions of BRUKINSA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients in Cohort 1 and in 7% in Cohort 2. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in > 2% of patients included neutropenia in Cohort 1. Adverse reaction leading to dose reduction occurred in 2 patients in Cohort 2 (each with one event: diarrhea and pneumonia). Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions in Cohort 1 in ASPEN.

The trials required an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L, platelet count ≥ 50 or ≥ 75 × 10 9 /L and adequate hepatic function and excluded patients requiring a strong CYP3A inhibitor or inducer. Patients received BRUKINSA 160 mg twice daily (97%) or 320 mg once daily (3%). The median age in both studies combined was 70 years (range: 37 to 95), 52% were male, 64% were Caucasian and 19% were Asian. Most patients (92%) had an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1. Eighty percent received BRUKINSA for 6 months or longer, and 67% received treatment for more than one year. Two fatal adverse reactions (2.3%) occurred within 30 days of the last dose of BRUKINSA, including myocardial infarction and a Covid-19 related death. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were pyrexia (8%) and pneumonia (7%). Adverse reactions lead to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients, dose reduction in 2.3%, and dose interruption in 34%. The leading cause of dose modification was respiratory tract infections (13%). Table 7 summarizes selected adverse reactions in BGB-3111-214 and BGB-3111-AU-003.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals, BRUKINSA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no available data on BRUKINSA use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis was associated with fetal heart malformation at approximately 5-fold human exposures (see Data ). Women should be advised to avoid pregnancy while taking BRUKINSA. If BRUKINSA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking BRUKINSA, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Embryo-fetal development toxicity studies were conducted in both rats and rabbits. Zanubrutinib was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 30, 75, and 150 mg/kg/day. Malformations in the heart (2- or 3-chambered hearts) were noted at all dose levels in the absence of maternal toxicity. The dose of 30 mg/kg/day is approximately 5 times the exposure (AUC) in patients receiving the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily. Administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at 30, 70, and 150 mg/kg/day resulted in post-implantation loss at the highest dose. The dose of 150 mg/kg is approximately 32 times the exposure (AUC) in patients at the recommended dose and was associated with maternal toxicity. In a pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study, zanubrutinib was administered orally to rats at doses of 30, 75, and 150 mg/kg/day from implantation through weaning. The offspring from the middle and high dose groups had decreased body weights preweaning, and all dose groups had adverse ocular findings (e.g., cataract, protruding eye). The dose of 30 mg/kg/day is approximately 5 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zanubrutinib or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from BRUKINSA in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with BRUKINSA and for two weeks following the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating BRUKINSA therapy. Contraception Females BRUKINSA can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BRUKINSA and for 1 week following the last dose of BRUKINSA. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to a fetus. Males Advise men to avoid fathering a child while receiving BRUKINSA and for 1 week following the last dose of BRUKINSA. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 847 patients in clinical studies with BRUKINSA, 53% were ≥ 65 years of age, and 20% were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between younger and older patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage modification is recommended in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (CLcr ≥ 15 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). Monitor for BRUKINSA adverse reactions in patients on dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage modification of BRUKINSA is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. The safety of BRUKINSA has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No dosage modification is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Monitor for BRUKINSA adverse reactions in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Zanubrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Zanubrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK activity. BTK is a signaling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis and adhesion. In nonclinical studies, zanubrutinib inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation and reduced tumor growth. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics BTK Occupancy in PBMCs and Lymph Nodes The median steady-state BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was maintained at 100% over 24 hours at a total daily dose of 320 mg in patients with B-cell malignancies. The median steady-state BTK occupancy in lymph nodes was 94% to 100% following the approved recommended dosage. Cardiac Electrophysiology At the approved recommended doses (160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily), there were no clinically relevant effects on the QTc interval. The effect of BRUKINSA on the QTc interval above the therapeutic exposure has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Zanubrutinib maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the plasma drug concentration over time curve (AUC) increase proportionally over a dosage range from 40 mg to 320 mg (0.13 to 1 time the recommended total daily dose). Limited systemic accumulation of zanubrutinib was observed following repeated administration. The geometric mean (%CV) zanubrutinib steady-state daily AUC is 2,099 (42%) ng∙h/mL following 160 mg twice daily and 1,917 (59%) ng∙h/mL following 320 mg once daily. The geometric mean (%CV) zanubrutinib steady-state C max is 295 (55%) ng/mL following 160 mg twice daily and 537 (55%) ng/mL following 320 mg once daily. Absorption The median t max of zanubrutinib is 2 hours. Effect of Food No clinically significant differences in zanubrutinib AUC or C max were observed following administration of a high-fat meal (approximately 1,000 calories with 50% of total caloric content from fat) in healthy subjects. Distribution The geometric mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of zanubrutinib is 537 (73%) L. The plasma protein binding of zanubrutinib is approximately 94% and the blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.7 to 0.8. Elimination The mean half-life (t ½ ) of zanubrutinib is approximately 2 to 4 hours following a single oral zanubrutinib dose of 160 mg or 320 mg. The geometric mean (%CV) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of zanubrutinib is 128 (58%) L/h. Metabolism Zanubrutinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450(CYP)3A. Excretion Following a single radiolabeled zanubrutinib dose of 320 mg to healthy subjects, approximately 87% of the dose was recovered in feces (38% unchanged) and 8% in urine (less than 1% unchanged). Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of zanubrutinib were observed based on age (19 to 90 years), sex, race (Asian, Caucasian, and Other), body weight (36 to 144 kg) or mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥ 15 mL/min as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). The effect of dialysis on zanubrutinib pharmacokinetics is unknown. Hepatic Impairment The total AUC of zanubrutinib increased by 11% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), by 21% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), and by 60% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) relative to subjects with normal liver function. The unbound AUC of zanubrutinib increased by 23% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), by 43% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) and by 194% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) relative to subjects with normal liver function . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration of multiple doses of CYP3A inhibitors increases zanubrutinib C max and AUC (Table 10). Table 10: Observed or Predicted Increase in Zanubrutinib Exposure After Co-Administration of CYP3A Inhibitors Co-administered CYP3A Inhibitor Increase in Zanubrutinib C max Increase in Zanubrutinib AUC Observed Itraconazole (200 mg once daily) 157% 278% Predicted Clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily) 175% 183% Diltiazem (60 mg three times daily) 151% 157% Erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) 284% 317% Fluconazole (200 mg once daily) 179% 177% Fluconazole (400 mg once daily) 270% 284% CYP3A Inducers: Co-administration of multiple doses of rifampin (strong CYP3A inducer) decreased the zanubrutinib C max by 92% and AUC by 93%. Co-administration of multiple doses of efavirenz (moderate CYP3A inducer) is predicted to decrease zanubrutinib C max by 58% and AUC by 60%. CYP3A Substrates: Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib decreased midazolam (CYP3A substrate) C max by 30% and AUC by 47%. CYP2C19 Substrates: Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib decreased omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) C max by 20% and AUC by 36%. Other CYP Substrates: No clinically significant differences were observed with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) pharmacokinetics when co-administered with zanubrutinib. Transporter Systems: Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib increased digoxin (P-gp substrate) C max by 34% and AUC by 11%. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) were observed when co-administered with zanubrutinib. Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: No clinically significant differences in zanubrutinib pharmacokinetics were observed when co-administered with gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists). In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: Zanubrutinib is an inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. Transporter Systems: Zanubrutinib is likely to be a substrate of P-gp. Zanubrutinib is not a substrate or inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3."

        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Zanubrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Zanubrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK activity. BTK is a signaling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis and adhesion. In nonclinical studies, zanubrutinib inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation and reduced tumor growth."

        "12.2 Pharmacodynamics BTK Occupancy in PBMCs and Lymph Nodes The median steady-state BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was maintained at 100% over 24 hours at a total daily dose of 320 mg in patients with B-cell malignancies. The median steady-state BTK occupancy in lymph nodes was 94% to 100% following the approved recommended dosage. Cardiac Electrophysiology At the approved recommended doses (160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily), there were no clinically relevant effects on the QTc interval. The effect of BRUKINSA on the QTc interval above the therapeutic exposure has not been evaluated."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Zanubrutinib maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the plasma drug concentration over time curve (AUC) increase proportionally over a dosage range from 40 mg to 320 mg (0.13 to 1 time the recommended total daily dose). Limited systemic accumulation of zanubrutinib was observed following repeated administration. The geometric mean (%CV) zanubrutinib steady-state daily AUC is 2,099 (42%) ng∙h/mL following 160 mg twice daily and 1,917 (59%) ng∙h/mL following 320 mg once daily. The geometric mean (%CV) zanubrutinib steady-state C max is 295 (55%) ng/mL following 160 mg twice daily and 537 (55%) ng/mL following 320 mg once daily. Absorption The median t max of zanubrutinib is 2 hours. Effect of Food No clinically significant differences in zanubrutinib AUC or C max were observed following administration of a high-fat meal (approximately 1,000 calories with 50% of total caloric content from fat) in healthy subjects. Distribution The geometric mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of zanubrutinib is 537 (73%) L. The plasma protein binding of zanubrutinib is approximately 94% and the blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.7 to 0.8. Elimination The mean half-life (t ½ ) of zanubrutinib is approximately 2 to 4 hours following a single oral zanubrutinib dose of 160 mg or 320 mg. The geometric mean (%CV) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of zanubrutinib is 128 (58%) L/h. Metabolism Zanubrutinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450(CYP)3A. Excretion Following a single radiolabeled zanubrutinib dose of 320 mg to healthy subjects, approximately 87% of the dose was recovered in feces (38% unchanged) and 8% in urine (less than 1% unchanged). Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of zanubrutinib were observed based on age (19 to 90 years), sex, race (Asian, Caucasian, and Other), body weight (36 to 144 kg) or mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥ 15 mL/min as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). The effect of dialysis on zanubrutinib pharmacokinetics is unknown. Hepatic Impairment The total AUC of zanubrutinib increased by 11% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), by 21% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), and by 60% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) relative to subjects with normal liver function. The unbound AUC of zanubrutinib increased by 23% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), by 43% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) and by 194% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) relative to subjects with normal liver function . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration of multiple doses of CYP3A inhibitors increases zanubrutinib C max and AUC (Table 10). Table 10: Observed or Predicted Increase in Zanubrutinib Exposure After Co-Administration of CYP3A Inhibitors Co-administered CYP3A Inhibitor Increase in Zanubrutinib C max Increase in Zanubrutinib AUC Observed Itraconazole (200 mg once daily) 157% 278% Predicted Clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily) 175% 183% Diltiazem (60 mg three times daily) 151% 157% Erythromycin (500 mg four times daily) 284% 317% Fluconazole (200 mg once daily) 179% 177% Fluconazole (400 mg once daily) 270% 284% CYP3A Inducers: Co-administration of multiple doses of rifampin (strong CYP3A inducer) decreased the zanubrutinib C max by 92% and AUC by 93%. Co-administration of multiple doses of efavirenz (moderate CYP3A inducer) is predicted to decrease zanubrutinib C max by 58% and AUC by 60%. CYP3A Substrates: Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib decreased midazolam (CYP3A substrate) C max by 30% and AUC by 47%. CYP2C19 Substrates: Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib decreased omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) C max by 20% and AUC by 36%. Other CYP Substrates: No clinically significant differences were observed with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) pharmacokinetics when co-administered with zanubrutinib. Transporter Systems: Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib increased digoxin (P-gp substrate) C max by 34% and AUC by 11%. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) were observed when co-administered with zanubrutinib. Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: No clinically significant differences in zanubrutinib pharmacokinetics were observed when co-administered with gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists). In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: Zanubrutinib is an inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. Transporter Systems: Zanubrutinib is likely to be a substrate of P-gp. Zanubrutinib is not a substrate or inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Mantle Cell Lymphoma The efficacy of BRUKINSA was assessed in BGB-3111-206 [NCT03206970], a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial of 86 previously treated patients with MCL who had received at least one prior therapy. BRUKINSA was given orally at a dose of 160 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age of patients was 60.5 years (range: 34 to 75) and the majority were male (78%). The median time since diagnosis to study entry was 30 months (range: 3 to 102) and the median number of prior therapies was 2 (range: 1 to 4). The most common prior regimens were CHOP-based (91%) followed by rituximab-based (74%). The majority of patients had extranodal involvement (71%) and refractory disease (52%). Blastoid variant of MCL was present in 14% of patients. The MIPI score was low in 58%, intermediate in 29%, and high risk in 13%. The efficacy of BRUKINSA was also assessed in BGB-3111-AU-003 [NCT02343120], a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation, global, multicenter, single-arm trial of B-cell malignancies including 32 previously treated MCL patients treated with BRUKINSA. BRUKINSA was given orally at doses of 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg daily. The median age of patients with previously treated MCL was 70 years (range: 42 to 86) and 38% of patients were ≥ 75 years old. Most patients were male (69%) and Caucasian (78%). The MIPI score was low in 28%, intermediate in 41%, and high risk in 31%. Tumor response was according to the 2014 Lugano Classification for both studies, and the primary efficacy endpoint was overall response rate as assessed by an Independent Review Committee. Table 11: Efficacy Results in Patients with MCL by Independent Review Committee Study BGB-3111-206 (N=86) Study BGB-3111-AU-003 (N=32) ORR: overall response rate, CR: complete response, PR: partial response, DoR: duration of response, CI: confidence interval, NE: not estimable.

Patients in Cohort 1 (n=201) were randomized 1:1 to receive BRUKINSA 160 mg twice daily or ibrutinib 420 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by number of prior therapies (0 versus 1-3 versus > 3) and CXCR4 status (presence or absence of a WHIM-like mutation as measured by Sanger assay). The major efficacy outcome was the response rate defined as PR or better as assessed by IRC based on standard consensus response criteria from the International Workshop on Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (IWWM)-6 criteria. An additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR). The median age was 70 years (range: 38 to 90) and 68% were male. Of those enrolled, 2% were Asian, 91% were White and 7% were of unknown race. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 was present in 93% patients at baseline and 7% had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2. A total of 82% had relapsed/refractory disease with 85% having received prior alkylating agents and 91% prior anti-CD20 therapy. The median number of prior therapies in those with relapsed/refractory disease was 1 (range: 1 to 8). A total of 91 (45%) patients had International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) high WM. The study did not meet statistical significance for the pre-specified efficacy outcome of superior CR+VGPR as assessed by IRC, tested first in patients with R/R disease in ASPEN. Table 12 shows the response rates in ASPEN based on IRC assessment.
