        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Select patients for treatment with RETEVMO based on the presence of a RET gene fusion (NSCLC, thyroid, or other solid tumors) or specific RET gene mutation (MTC). ( 2.1 , 14 ) Recommended dosage in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age or older is based on weight ( 2.3 ): Less than 50 kg: 120 mg orally twice daily 50 kg or greater: 160 mg orally twice daily Reduce RETEVMO dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 2.7 , 8.7 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for treatment with RETEVMO based on the presence of a RET gene fusion (NSCLC, thyroid cancer, or other solid tumors) or specific RET gene mutation (MTC) in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Information on FDA-approved test(s) for the detection of RET gene fusions and RET gene mutations is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. An FDA-approved companion diagnostic test for the detection of RET gene fusions and RET gene mutations in plasma or in tumors other than NSCLC and thyroid cancer is not currently available. 2.2 Important Administration Instructions RETEVMO may be taken with or without food unless coadministered with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.3 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of RETEVMO based on body weight is: Less than 50 kg: 120 mg 50 kg or greater: 160 mg Take RETEVMO orally twice daily (approximately every 12 hours) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Swallow the capsules whole. Do not crush or chew the capsules. Do not take a missed dose unless it is more than 6 hours until next scheduled dose. If vomiting occurs after RETEVMO administration, do not take an additional dose and continue to the next scheduled time for the next dose. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Concomitant Use of Acid-Reducing Agents Avoid concomitant use of a PPI, a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist, or a locally-acting antacid with RETEVMO [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . If concomitant use cannot be avoided: Take RETEVMO with food when coadministered with a PPI. Take RETEVMO 2 hours before or 10 hours after administration of an H2 receptor antagonist. Take RETEVMO 2 hours before or 2 hours after administration of a locally-acting antacid. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dose reductions for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1 .

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: Monitor ALT and AST prior to initiating RETEVMO, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on severity. ( 2.5 , 5.1 ) Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis : Monitor for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms. Withhold, reduce the dose or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on severity. ( 2.5 , 5.2 ) Hypertension: Do not initiate RETEVMO in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure (BP) prior to initiating RETEVMO. Monitor BP after 1 week, at least monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on severity. ( 2.5 , 5.3 ) QT Interval Prolongation: Monitor patients who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation. Assess QT interval, electrolytes and TSH at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor QT interval more frequently when RETEVMO is concomitantly administered with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors or drugs known to prolong QTc interval. Withhold and dose reduce or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on severity. ( 2.5 , 5.4 ) Hemorrhagic Events: Permanently discontinue RETEVMO in patients with severe or life-threatening hemorrhage. ( 2.5 , 5.5 ) Hypersensitivity: Withhold RETEVMO and initiate corticosteroids. Upon resolution, resume at a reduced dose and increase dose by 1 dose level each week until reaching the dose taken prior to onset of hypersensitivity. Continue steroids until patient reaches target dose and then taper. ( 2.5 , 5.6 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Closely monitor patients at risk and treat as clinically indicated. ( 5.7 ) Risk of Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold RETEVMO for at least 7 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of RETEVMO after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.8 ) Hypothyroidism: Monitor thyroid function before treatment with RETEVMO and periodically during treatment. Withhold until clinically stable or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the possible risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients treated with RETEVMO. Increased AST occurred in 59% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 events in 11% and increased ALT occurred in 55% of patients, including Grade 3 or 4 events in 12% [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The median time to first onset for increased AST was 6 weeks (range: 1 day to 3.4 years) and increased ALT was 5.8 weeks (range: 1 day to 2.5 years). Monitor ALT and AST prior to initiating RETEVMO, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months, then monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . 5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, and fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with RETEVMO. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.8% of patients who received RETEVMO, including 0.3% with Grade 3 or 4 events, and 0.3% with fatal reactions. Monitor for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Withhold RETEVMO and promptly investigate for ILD in any patient who presents with acute or worsening of respiratory symptoms which may be indicative of ILD (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever). Withhold, reduce dose or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on severity of confirmed ILD [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ]. 5.3 Hypertension Hypertension occurred in 41% of patients, including Grade 3 hypertension in 20% and Grade 4 in one (0.1%) patient [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Overall, 6.3% had their dose interrupted and 1.3% had their dose reduced for hypertension. Treatment-emergent hypertension was most commonly managed with anti-hypertension medications. Do not initiate RETEVMO in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Optimize blood pressure prior to initiating RETEVMO. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, at least monthly thereafter and as clinically indicated. Initiate or adjust anti-hypertensive therapy as appropriate. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . 5.4 QT Interval Prolongation RETEVMO can cause concentration-dependent QT interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . An increase in QTcF interval to >500 ms was measured in 7% of patients and an increase in the QTcF interval of at least 60 ms over baseline was measured in 20% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . RETEVMO has not been studied in patients with clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or recent myocardial infarction. Monitor patients who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, and severe or uncontrolled heart failure. Assess QT interval, electrolytes and TSH at baseline and periodically during treatment, adjusting frequency based upon risk factors including diarrhea. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating RETEVMO and during treatment. Monitor the QT interval more frequently when RETEVMO is concomitantly administered with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors or drugs known to prolong QTc interval. Withhold and dose reduce or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . 5.5 Hemorrhagic Events Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with RETEVMO. Grade ≥3 hemorrhagic events occurred in 3.1% of patients treated with RETEVMO, including 4 (0.5%) patients with fatal hemorrhagic events, including cerebral hemorrhage (n = 2), tracheostomy site hemorrhage (n = 1), and hemoptysis (n=1). Permanently discontinue RETEVMO in patients with severe or life-threatening hemorrhage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . 5.6 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity occurred in 6% of patients receiving RETEVMO, including Grade 3 hypersensitivity in 1.9%. The median time to onset was 1.9 weeks (range: 5 days to 2 years). Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity included fever, rash and arthralgias or myalgias with concurrent decreased platelets or transaminitis. If hypersensitivity occurs, withhold RETEVMO and begin corticosteroids at a dose of 1 mg/kg prednisone (or equivalent). Upon resolution of the event, resume RETEVMO at a reduced dose and increase the dose of RETEVMO by 1 dose level each week as tolerated until reaching the dose taken prior to onset of hypersensitivity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Continue steroids until patient reaches target dose and then taper. Permanently discontinue RETEVMO for recurrent hypersensitivity. 5.7 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred in 0.6% of patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma receiving RETEVMO [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients may be at risk of TLS if they have rapidly growing tumors, a high tumor burden, renal dysfunction, or dehydration. Closely monitor patients at risk, consider appropriate prophylaxis including hydration, and treat as clinically indicated. 5.8 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Therefore, RETEVMO has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold RETEVMO for at least 7 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of RETEVMO after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.9 Hypothyroidism RETEVMO can cause hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 13% of patients treated with RETEVMO; all reactions were Grade 1 or 2. Hypothyroidism occurred in 13% of patients (50/373) with thyroid cancer and 13% of patients (53/423) with other solid tumors including NSCLC [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor thyroid function before treatment with RETEVMO and periodically during treatment. Treat with thyroid hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold RETEVMO until clinically stable or permanently discontinue RETEVMO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on data from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, RETEVMO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of selpercatinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis at maternal exposures that were approximately equal to those observed at the recommended human dose of 160 mg twice daily resulted in embryolethality and malformations. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RETEVMO and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RETEVMO and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] QT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hemorrhagic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Risk of Impaired Wound Healing [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) were edema, diarrhea, fatigue, dry mouth, hypertension, abdominal pain, constipation, rash, nausea, and headache. ( 6 ) The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥5%) were decreased lymphocytes, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), decreased sodium, and decreased calcium. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. RET Gene Fusion or Gene Mutation Positive Solid Tumors The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS and below reflects exposure to RETEVMO as a single agent at 160 mg orally twice daily evaluated in 796 patients with advanced solid tumors in LIBRETTO-001 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Among the 796 patients who received RETEVMO, 84% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 73% were exposed for greater than one year. Among these patients, 96% received at least one dose of RETEVMO at the recommended dosage of 160 mg orally twice daily. The median age was 59 years (range: 15 to 92 years); 0.3% were pediatric patients 12 to 16 years of age; 51% were male; and 69% were White, 23% were Asian, 5% were Hispanic/Latino, and 3% were Black. The most common tumors were NSCLC (45%), MTC (40%), and non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (7%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients who received RETEVMO. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2% of patients) were pneumonia, pleural effusion, abdominal pain, hemorrhage, hypersensitivity, dyspnea, and hyponatremia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients; fatal adverse reactions included sepsis (n = 6), respiratory failure (n = 5), hemorrhage (n = 4), pneumonia (n = 3), pneumonitis (n = 2), cardiac arrest (n=2), sudden death (n = 1), and cardiac failure (n = 1). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 8% of patients who received RETEVMO. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation in ≥0.5% of patients included increased ALT (0.6%), fatigue (0.6%), sepsis (0.5%), and increased AST (0.5%). Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 64% of patients who received RETEVMO. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in ≥5% of patients included increased ALT, increased AST, diarrhea, and hypertension. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 41% of patients who received RETEVMO. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reductions in ≥2% of patients included increased ALT, increased AST, QT prolongation, fatigue, diarrhea, drug hypersensitivity, and edema. The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) were edema, diarrhea, fatigue, dry mouth, hypertension, abdominal pain, constipation, rash, nausea, and headache. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥5%) were decreased lymphocytes, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), decreased sodium, and decreased calcium.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Acid-Reducing Agents: Avoid coadministration. If coadministration cannot be avoided, take RETEVMO with food (with PPI) or modify its administration time (with H2 receptor antagonist or locally-acting antacid). ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the RETEVMO dose. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Avoid coadministration. ( 7.1 ) CYP2C8 and CYP3A Substrates: Avoid coadministration. If coadministration cannot be avoided, modify the substrate dosage as recommended in its product labeling. ( 7.2 ) Certain P-gp Substrates: Avoid coadministration. If coadministration cannot be avoided, modify the substrate dosage as recommended in its product labeling. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on RETEVMO Acid-Reducing Agents Concomitant use of RETEVMO with acid-reducing agents decreases selpercatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce RETEVMO anti-tumor activity. Avoid concomitant use of PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists, and locally-acting antacids with RETEVMO. If coadministration cannot be avoided, take RETEVMO with food (with a PPI) or modify its administration time (with a H2 receptor antagonist or a locally-acting antacid) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use of RETEVMO with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases selpercatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of RETEVMO adverse reactions, including QTc interval prolongation. Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors with RETEVMO. If concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the RETEVMO dosage and monitor the QT interval with ECGs more frequently [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Warning and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of RETEVMO with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreases selpercatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce RETEVMO anti-tumor activity. Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers with RETEVMO. 7.2 Effects of RETEVMO on Other Drugs CYP2C8 and CYP3A Substrates RETEVMO is a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor and a weak CYP3A inhibitor. Concomitant use of RETEVMO with CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrates increases their plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates. Avoid coadministration of RETEVMO with CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to increased adverse reactions. If coadministration cannot be avoided, follow recommendations for CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrates provided in their approved product labeling. Certain P-gp Substrates RETEVMO is a P-gp inhibitor. Concomitant use of RETEVMO with P-gp substrates increases their plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates. Avoid coadministration of RETEVMO with P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to increased adverse reactions. If coadministration cannot be avoided, follow recommendations for P-gp substrates provided in their approved product labeling. 7.3 Drugs that Prolong QT Interval RETEVMO is associated with QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Monitor the QT interval with ECGs more frequently in patients who require treatment with concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Pediatric Use: Monitor open growth plates in adolescent patients. Consider interrupting or discontinuing RETEVMO if abnormalities occur. ( 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies, and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] , RETEVMO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on RETEVMO use in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risk. Administration of selpercatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryolethality and malformations at maternal exposures that were approximately equal to the human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Selpercatinib administration to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses ≥100 mg/kg [approximately 3.6 times the human exposure based on the area under the curve (AUC) at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily] resulted in 100% post-implantation loss. At the dose of 50 mg/kg [approximately equal to the human exposure (AUC) at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily], 6 of 8 females had 100% early resorptions; the remaining 2 females had high levels of early resorptions with only 3 viable fetuses across the 2 litters. All viable fetuses had decreased fetal body weight and malformations (2 with short tail and one with small snout and localized edema of the neck and thorax). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of selpercatinib or its metabolites in human milk or on their effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with RETEVMO and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on animal data, RETEVMO can cause embryolethality and malformations at doses resulting in exposures less than or equal to the human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating RETEVMO [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RETEVMO and for 1 week after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RETEVMO and for 1 week after the last dose. Infertility RETEVMO may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of RETEVMO have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy and for advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate). Use of RETEVMO for these indications is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 , 14.3 )] . The safety and effectiveness of RETEVMO have not been established in these indications in patients less than 12 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of RETEVMO have not been established in pediatric patients for other indications [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a juvenile rat toxicity study, animals were dosed daily with selpercatinib from post-natal day 21 to day 70 (approximately equivalent to a human child to late adolescent). Selpercatinib increased physeal thickness of multiple bones, extending into the metaphysis and associated with decreased trabecular bone, which was not reversible at doses approximately equivalent to or greater than the adult human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily. Growth plate changes were associated with impairment of bone modeling, resulting in decreased femur length and with reduction in bone mineral density. Selpercatinib also induced reversible hypocellularity of bone marrow in males at ≥30 mg/kg (approximately equivalent to or greater than the adult human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily), and reversible alterations of dentin composition at ≥50 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the adult human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily). Irreversible, dose-dependent degeneration of testicular germinal epithelium, with vacuolation of Sertoli cells and corresponding depletion of spermatozoa in the epididymides, was also observed at ≥ 30 mg/kg (approximately equivalent to or greater than the adult human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily) and affected male reproductive performance at 50 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the adult human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily). Females exhibited delay in attainment of vaginal patency, a marker of sexual maturity, at 125 mg/kg (approximately 4 times the adult human exposure at the clinical dose of 160 mg twice daily); this affect was associated with lower mean body weight. Similar effects in irregular thickening of growth plates in adult rats and minipigs, and tooth dysplasia and malocclusion, resulting in tooth loss in adult rats were observed in repeat dose studies of up to 13-week duration with selpercatinib. Monitor growth plates in adolescent patients with open growth plates. Consider interrupting or discontinuing therapy based on the severity of any growth plate abnormalities and based on an individual risk-benefit assessment. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 796 patients who received RETEVMO, 34% (268 patients) were ≥65 years of age and 9% (74 patients) were ≥75 years of age. No overall differences were observed in the safety or effectiveness of RETEVMO between patients who were ≥65 years of age and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild to severe renal impairment [estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) ≥15 to 89 mL/min, estimated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation]. The recommended dosage has not been established for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Reduce the dose when administering RETEVMO to patients with severe [total bilirubin greater than 3 to 10 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and any AST] hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild (total bilirubin less than or equal to ULN with AST greater than ULN or total bilirubin greater than 1 to 1.5 times ULN with any AST) or moderate (total bilirubin greater than 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Monitor for RETEVMO-related adverse reactions in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Selpercatinib is a kinase inhibitor. Selpercatinib inhibited wild-type RET and multiple mutated RET isoforms as well as VEGFR1 and VEGFR3 with IC 50 values ranging from 0.92 nM to 67.8 nM. In other enzyme assays, selpercatinib also inhibited FGFR 1, 2, and 3 at higher concentrations that were still clinically achievable. In cellular assays, selpercatinib inhibited RET at approximately 60-fold lower concentrations than FGFR1 and 2 and approximately 8-fold lower concentration than VEGFR3. Certain point mutations in RET or chromosomal rearrangements involving in-frame fusions of RET with various partners can result in constitutively activated chimeric RET fusion proteins that can act as oncogenic drivers by promoting cell proliferation of tumor cell lines. In in vitro and in vivo tumor models, selpercatinib demonstrated anti-tumor activity in cells harboring constitutive activation of RET proteins resulting from gene fusions and mutations, including CCDC6-RET, KIF5B-RET, RET V804M, and RET M918T. In addition, selpercatinib showed anti-tumor activity in mice intracranially implanted with a patient-derived RET fusion positive tumor. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationship Selpercatinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response have not been fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of RETEVMO on the QTc interval was evaluated in a thorough QT study in healthy subjects. The largest mean increase in QTc is predicted to be 10.6 msec (upper 90% confidence interval: 12.1 msec) at the mean steady-state maximum concentration (C max ) observed in patients after administration of 160 mg twice daily. The increase in QTc was concentration-dependent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of selpercatinib were evaluated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors administered 160 mg twice daily unless otherwise specified. Steady state selpercatinib AUC and C max increased in a slightly greater than dose proportional manner over the dose range of 20 mg once daily to 240 mg twice daily [0.06 to 1.5 times the maximum recommended total daily dosage]. Steady-state was reached by approximately 7 days and the median accumulation ratio after administration of 160 mg twice daily was 3.4-fold. Mean steady-state selpercatinib [coefficient of variation (CV%)] C max was 2,980 (53%) ng/mL and AUC 0-24h was 51,600 (58%) ng*h/mL. Absorption The median t max of selpercatinib is 2 hours. The mean absolute bioavailability of RETEVMO capsules is 73% (60% to 82%) in healthy subjects. Effect of Food No clinically significant differences in selpercatinib AUC or C max were observed following administration of a high-fat meal (approximately 900 calories, 58 grams carbohydrate, 56 grams fat and 43 grams protein) in healthy subjects. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution (V ss /F) of selpercatinib is 191 L. Protein binding of selpercatinib is 96% in vitro and is independent of concentration. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.7. Elimination The apparent clearance (CL/F) of selpercatinib is 6 L/h in patients and the half-life is 32 hours following oral administration of RETEVMO in healthy subjects. Metabolism Selpercatinib is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4. Following oral administration of a single radiolabeled 160 mg dose of selpercatinib to healthy subjects, unchanged selpercatinib constituted 86% of the radioactive drug components in plasma. Excretion Following oral administration of a single radiolabeled 160 mg dose of selpercatinib to healthy subjects, 69% of the administered dose was recovered in feces (14% unchanged) and 24% in urine (12% unchanged). Specific Populations The apparent volume of distribution and clearance of selpercatinib increase with increasing body weight (27 kg to 179 kg). No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of selpercatinib were observed based on age (15 years to 92 years), sex, or mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (eGFR ≥15 to 89 mL/min). The effect of ESRD on selpercatinib pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The selpercatinib AUC 0-INF increased by 7%, 32%, and 77% in subjects with mild (total bilirubin less than or equal to ULN with AST greater than ULN or total bilirubin greater than 1 to 1.5 times ULN with any AST), moderate (total bilirubin greater than 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST), and severe (total bilirubin greater than 3 to 10 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches Proton-Pump Inhibitors (PPI): Coadministration with multiple daily doses of omeprazole (PPI) decreased selpercatinib AUC 0-INF and C max when RETEVMO was administered fasting. Coadministration with multiple daily doses of omeprazole did not significantly change the selpercatinib AUC 0-INF and C max when RETEVMO was administered with food ( Table 7 ). Table 7: Change in Selpercatinib Exposure After Coadministration with PPI 1 High-fat meal: approximately 150, 250, and 500-600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively; approximately 800 to 1,000 calories total. 2 Low-fat meal: approximately 390 calories and 10 g of fat. Selpercatinib AUC 0-INF Selpercatinib C max RETEVMO fasting Reference Reference RETEVMO fasting + PPI ↓ 69% ↓ 88% RETEVMO with a high-fat meal 1 + PPI ↑ 2% ↓ 49% RETEVMO with a low-fat meal 2 + PPI No change ↓ 22% H2 Receptor Antagonists: No clinically significant differences in selpercatinib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with multiple daily doses of ranitidine (H2 receptor antagonist) given 10 hours prior to and 2 hours after the RETEVMO dose (administered fasting). Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of multiple doses of itraconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) increased the selpercatinib AUC 0-INF by 133% and C max by 30%. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of multiple doses of diltiazem, fluconazole, or verapamil (moderate CYP3A inhibitors) is predicted to increase the selpercatinib AUC by 60-99% and C max by 46-76%. Strong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of multiple doses of rifampin (strong CYP3A inducer) decreased the selpercatinib AUC 0-INF by 87% and C max by 70%. Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of multiple doses of bosentan or efavirenz (moderate CYP3A inducers) is predicted to decrease the selpercatinib AUC by 40-70% and C max by 34-57%. Weak CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of multiple doses of modafinil (weak CYP3A inducer) is predicted to decrease the selpercatinib AUC by 33% and C max by 26%. CYP2C8 Substrates : Coadministration of RETEVMO with repaglinide (sensitive CYP2C8 substrate) increased the repaglinide AUC 0-INF by 188% and C max by 91%. CYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of RETEVMO with midazolam (sensitive CYP3A substrate) increased the midazolam AUC 0-INF by 54% and C max by 39%. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates: Coadministration of RETEVMO with dabigatran (P-gp substrate) increased the dabigatran AUC 0-INF by 38% and C max by 43%. P-gp Inhibitors: No clinically significant differences in selpercatinib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with a single dose of rifampin (P-gp inhibitor). MATE1 Substrates: No clinically significant differences in glucose levels were observed when metformin (MATE1 substrate) was coadministered with selpercatinib. In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: Selpercatinib does not inhibit or induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations. Transporter Systems: Selpercatinib inhibits MATE1 and BCRP, but does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Selpercatinib may increase serum creatinine by decreasing renal tubular secretion of creatinine via inhibition of MATE1 [see Adverse Effects ( 6.1 )] . Selpercatinib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP, but not for OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, or MATE2-K."

CYP2C8 Substrates : Coadministration of RETEVMO with repaglinide (sensitive CYP2C8 substrate) increased the repaglinide AUC 0-INF by 188% and C max by 91%. CYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of RETEVMO with midazolam (sensitive CYP3A substrate) increased the midazolam AUC 0-INF by 54% and C max by 39%. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates: Coadministration of RETEVMO with dabigatran (P-gp substrate) increased the dabigatran AUC 0-INF by 38% and C max by 43%. P-gp Inhibitors: No clinically significant differences in selpercatinib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with a single dose of rifampin (P-gp inhibitor). MATE1 Substrates: No clinically significant differences in glucose levels were observed when metformin (MATE1 substrate) was coadministered with selpercatinib. In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: Selpercatinib does not inhibit or induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations. Transporter Systems: Selpercatinib inhibits MATE1 and BCRP, but does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Selpercatinib may increase serum creatinine by decreasing renal tubular secretion of creatinine via inhibition of MATE1 [see Adverse Effects ( 6.1 )] . Selpercatinib is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP, but not for OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, or MATE2-K."

Selpercatinib was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assays, with or without metabolic activation, or clastogenic in the in vitro micronucleus assay in human peripheral lymphocytes, with or without metabolic activation. Selpercatinib was positive in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats at concentrations >7 times the C max at the human dose of 160 mg twice daily. In general toxicology studies, male rats and minipigs exhibited testicular degeneration which was associated with luminal cell debris and/or reduced luminal sperm in the epididymis at selpercatinib exposures approximately 0.4 (rat) and 0.1 (minipig) times the clinical exposure by AUC at the recommended human dose. In a dedicated fertility study in male rats, administration of selpercatinib at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately twice the clinical exposure by AUC at the 160 twice daily dose) for 28 days prior to cohabitation with untreated females did not affect mating or have clear effects on fertility. Males did, however, display a dose-dependent increase in testicular germ cell depletion and spermatid retention at doses ≥3 mg/kg (~0.2 times the clinical exposure by AUC at the 160 twice daily dose) accompanied by altered sperm morphology at 30 mg/kg. In a dedicated fertility study in female rats treated with selpercatinib for 15 days before mating to Gestational Day 7, there were decreases in the number of estrous cycles at a dose of 75 mg/kg (approximately equal to the human exposure by AUC at the 160 mg twice daily clinical dose). While selpercatinib did not have clear effects on mating performance or ability to become pregnant at any dose level, half of females at the 75 mg/kg dose level had 100% nonviable embryos. At the same dose level in females with some viable embryos there were increases in post-implantation loss. In a 3-month general toxicology study in minipigs, there were findings of decreased or absent corpora lutea at a selpercatinib dose of 15 mg/kg (approximately 0.3 times to the human exposure by AUC at the 160 mg twice daily clinical dose).

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 RET Fusion-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The efficacy of RETEVMO was evaluated in patients with advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC enrolled in a multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort clinical trial (LIBRETTO-001, NCT03157128). The study enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive NSCLC who had progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy and patients with locally advanced (stage III who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation) or metastatic NSCLC without prior systemic therapy in separate cohorts. Identification of a RET gene alteration was prospectively determined in local laboratories using next generation sequencing (NGS), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or other local testing methods. Adult patients received RETEVMO 160 mg orally twice daily until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression; patients enrolled in the dose escalation phase were permitted to adjust their dose to 160 mg twice daily. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), as determined by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC) according to RECIST v1.1. RET Fusion-Positive NSCLC Previously Treated with Platinum Chemotherapy Efficacy was evaluated in 247 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC previously treated with platinum chemotherapy enrolled into a cohort of LIBRETTO-001. The median age was 61 years (range: 23 to 81); 57% were female; 44% were White, 48% were Asian, 4.9% were Black, and 2.8% were Hispanic/Latino. ECOG performance status was 0-1 (97%) or 2 (3%) and 97% of patients had metastatic disease. Patients received a median of 2 prior systemic therapies (range 1–15); 58% had prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. RET fusions were detected in 94% of patients using NGS (84.6% tumor samples; 9.3% blood or plasma samples), 4.0% using FISH, 1.6% using PCR and 0.4% by other local testing methods. Efficacy results for previously treated RET fusion-positive NSCLC are summarized in Table 8 .

Among the 247 patients with previously treated RET fusion-positive NSCLC, 16 had measurable CNS metastases at baseline as assessed by BIRC. One patient received radiation therapy (RT) to the brain within 2 months prior to study entry. Responses in intracranial lesions were observed in 14 of these 16 patients; 39% of responders had an intracranial DOR of ≥ 12 months. Treatment-naïve RET Fusion-Positive NSCLC Efficacy was evaluated in 69 patients with treatment-naïve RET fusion-positive NSCLC enrolled into a cohort of LIBRETTO-001. The median age was 63 years (range 23 to 92); 62% were female; 70% were White, 19% were Asian, and 6% were Black. ECOG performance status was 0-1 (94%) or 2 (6%) and 99% of patients had metastatic disease. RET fusions were detected in 91% of patients using NGS (60.9% tumor samples; 30.4% in blood), 7.2% using FISH and 1.4% using PCR. Efficacy results for treatment naïve RET fusion-positive NSCLC are summarized in Table 9 .
