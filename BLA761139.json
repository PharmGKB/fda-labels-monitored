If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. LVEF less than 40% or absolute decrease from baseline is greater than 20% Interrupt ENHERTU. Repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of less than 40% or absolute decrease from baseline of greater than 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) Permanently discontinue ENHERTU. 2.4 Preparation and Administration In order to prevent medication errors, check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) and not trastuzumab or ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Reconstitute and further dilute ENHERTU prior to intravenous infusion. Use appropriate aseptic technique. ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Reconstitution Reconstitute immediately before dilution. More than one vial may be needed for a full dose. Calculate the dose (mg), the total volume of reconstituted ENHERTU solution required, and the number of vial(s) of ENHERTU needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Reconstitute each 100 mg vial by using a sterile syringe to slowly inject 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP into each vial to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL. Swirl the vial gently until completely dissolved. Do not shake . Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution should be clear and colorless to light yellow. Do not use if visible particles are observed or if the solution is cloudy or discolored. If not used immediately, store the reconstituted ENHERTU vials in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours from the time of reconstitution, protected from light. Do not freeze . The product does not contain a preservative. Discard unused ENHERTU after 24 hours refrigerated. Dilution Dilute the calculated volume of reconstituted ENHERTU in an intravenous infusion bag containing 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP . DO NOT use Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. ENHERTU is compatible with an infusion bag made of polyvinylchloride or polyolefin (copolymer of ethylene and polypropylene). Gently invert the infusion bag to thoroughly mix the solution. Do not shake . Cover the infusion bag to protect from light. If not used immediately, store at room temperature for up to 4 hours including preparation and infusion, or in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours, protected from light. Do not freeze . Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Administration If the prepared infusion solution was stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F]), allow the solution to reach room temperature prior to administration. Cover the infusion bag to protect from light. Administer ENHERTU as an intravenous infusion only with an infusion set made of polyolefin or polybutadiene. Administer ENHERTU with a 0.20 or 0.22 micron in-line polyethersulfone (PES) or polysulfone (PS) filter. Do NOT administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Cover the infusion bag to protect from light during administration. Do not mix ENHERTU with other drugs or administer other drugs through the same intravenous line. First infusion: Administer infusion over 90 minutes. Subsequent infusions: Administer over 30 minutes if prior infusions were well tolerated."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia: Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Manage through treatment interruption or dose reduction. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) Left Ventricular Dysfunction: Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage through treatment interruption or discontinuation. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF). ( 2.3 , 5.3 ) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD, consider corticosteroid treatment (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). Withhold ENHERTU until recovery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In cases of symptomatic ILD (Grade 2 or greater), promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients who are diagnosed with symptomatic (Grade 2 or greater) ILD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Metastatic Breast Cancer and HER2-Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) In patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2-mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5 months (range: 0.9 to 23). Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21). 5.2 Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Metastatic Breast Cancer and HER2-Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) In patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2-mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2 to 664). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients. Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. 5.3 Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of less than 40% or absolute decrease from baseline of greater than 20% is confirmed. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF less than 50% prior to initiation of treatment. Metastatic Breast Cancer and HER2-Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) In patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2-mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade 3. Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on echocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In postmarketing reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Based on its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase inhibitor component of ENHERTU, DXd, can also cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Verify pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of ENHERTU. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of ENHERTU in pregnant women. In postmarketing reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death ( see Data ). Based on its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase inhibitor component of ENHERTU, DXd, can also cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU ( see Clinical Considerations ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received ENHERTU during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data There are no available data on the use of ENHERTU in pregnant women. In postmarketing reports in pregnant women receiving a HER2-directed antibody, cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death have been reported. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received a HER2-directed antibody either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In some case reports, amniotic fluid index increased after use of a HER2-directed antibody was stopped. Animal Data There were no animal reproductive or developmental toxicity studies conducted with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data regarding the presence of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception Females ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings in animal toxicity studies, ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were 65 years or older and 3.6% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged 65 years or older (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). Of the 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Gastric01, 56% were 65 years or older and 14% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of ENHERTU is required in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥60 and <90 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr ≥30 and <60 mL/min) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of ENHERTU is required in patients with mild (total bilirubin ≤ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) or moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "11 DESCRIPTION Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of three components: 1) a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), covalently linked to 2) a topoisomerase inhibitor, via 3) a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. Deruxtecan is composed of a protease-cleavable maleimide tetrapeptide linker and the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd, which is an exatecan derivative. The antibody is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology, and the topoisomerase inhibitor and linker are produced by chemical synthesis. Approximately 8 molecules of deruxtecan are attached to each antibody molecule. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki has the following structure: ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a sterile, white to yellowish white, preservative-free lyophilized powder in single-dose vials. Each vial delivers 100 mg of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, L-histidine (4.45 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (20.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.5 mg), and sucrose (450 mg). Following reconstitution with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the resulting concentration of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is 20 mg/mL with a pH of 5.5. The resulting solution is administered by intravenous infusion following dilution. Chemical Structure"

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody is a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1. The small molecule, DXd, is a topoisomerase I inhibitor attached to the antibody by a cleavable linker. Following binding to HER2 on tumor cells, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki undergoes internalization and intracellular linker cleavage by lysosomal enzymes. Upon release, the membrane-permeable DXd causes DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The administration of multiple doses of ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks did not show a large mean effect (i.e. >20 ms) on the QTc interval in an open-label, single-arm study in 51 patients with metastatic HER2-positive cancer. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was evaluated in patients with cancer. Following a single dose, exposures (C max and AUC) of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and released topoisomerase inhibitor (DXd) increased proportionally over a dose range of 3.2 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg (approximately 0.6 to 1.5 times the recommended dose in breast cancer and NSCLC and 0.5 to 1.25 times the recommended dose in gastric cancer). Metastatic Breast Cancer At the recommended dosage of ENHERTU for patients with metastatic breast cancer, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation [CV]%) C max of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 133 µg/mL (19%) and 4.7 ng/mL (43%), respectively, and the AUC of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 780 µg∙day/mL (27%) and 29 ng∙day/mL (42%), respectively, based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. Accumulation of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was approximately 35% at steady-state (Cycle 3). Unresectable or Metastatic HER2-Mutant NSCLC At the recommended dosage of ENHERTU for patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC, the geometric mean (CV%) C max,ss of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 141 µg/mL (21%) and 7.2 ng/mL (44%), respectively, and the AUC ss of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 775 µg∙day/mL (33%) and 40.9 ng∙day/mL (43%), respectively, based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. Accumulation of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was approximately 31% at steady-state based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer At the recommended dosage of ENHERTU for patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer, the geometric mean C max,ss of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 126 µg/mL (18%) and 5.2 ng/mL (42%), respectively, and the AUC ss of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 743 µg∙day/mL (26%) and 33 ng∙day/mL (43%), respectively, based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. Accumulation of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was approximately 39% at steady-state (Cycle 3). Distribution Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated volume of distribution of the central compartment (V c ) of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 2.68 L. For humans, DXd plasma protein binding is approximately 97% and the blood-to-plasma ratio is approximately 0.6, in vitro. Elimination The median elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and HER2-positive gastric cancer was approximately 5.4-5.7 days. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated systemic clearance of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 0.41 L/day. The median apparent elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of DXd in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, and HER2-positive gastric cancer was approximately 5.4-6.1 days. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated apparent systemic clearance of DXd was 18.3 L/h. Metabolism The humanized HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. In vitro, DXd is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki or DXd were observed for age (20-96 years); race (Asian [n=906] vs Non-Asian [n=763]), including White [n=619], Black or African American [n=36], and Other [n=108]; sex; body weight (27.3-125.4 kg); mild (total bilirubin ≤ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST, n=575) hepatic impairment; mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥60 and <90 mL/min, n=646) or moderate (CLcr ≥30 and <60 mL/min, n=251) renal impairment based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. The pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki or DXd in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 ULN with any AST) or severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on DXd: Coadministration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with multiple doses of ENHERTU increased steady state AUC 0-17 days of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki by 11% and DXd by 18%. The impact of these changes is not clinically meaningful. Effect of OATP Inhibitors on DXd: Coadministration of ritonavir, a dual inhibitor of OATP1B/CYP3A, with multiple doses of ENHERTU increased steady state AUC 0-17 days of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki by 19% and DXd by 22%. The impact of these changes is not clinically meaningful. In Vitro Studies Effects of DXd on CYP Enzymes: DXd does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A nor induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A. Effects of DXd on Transporters: At clinically relevant concentrations (steady-state C max of ~0.2 μmol/L), DXd has a low potential to inhibit OAT1 (IC 50 value of 12.7 μmol/L), OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1 (IC 50 value of 14.4 μmol/L), OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, BCRP, or BSEP transporters. Effects of Other Drugs on DXd: DXd is a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE2-K, P-gp, MRP1, and BCRP. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of ENHERTU or of other anti-HER2 products. During the median 14-month treatment period in HER2-positive breast cancer patients in DESTINY-Breast03 with a median ADA sampling period of 13 months, treatment-emergent ADA (or anti-fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki antibodies) developed in 1.6% (4/256) of patients who received ENHERTU. The incidence of treatment-emergent neutralizing antibodies against fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 0.4% (1/256). During the median 7-month treatment period in HER2-positive breast cancer patients in DESTINY-Breast01 with a median ADA sampling period of 9 months, treatment-emergent ADA developed in 1.2% (3/249) of patients who received ENHERTU. The incidence of treatment-emergent neutralizing antibodies against fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 0% (0/249). During the median 8-month treatment period in HER2-low breast cancer patients in DESTINY-Breast04 with a median ADA sampling period of 8 months, treatment-emergent ADA developed in 2.0% (7/357) of patients who received ENHERTU. The incidence of treatment-emergent neutralizing antibodies against fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 0% (0/357). During the median 3.5-month treatment period in HER2-mutant NSCLC patients in DESTINY-Lung02 with median ADA sampling period of 2.2 months, treatment-emergent ADA developed in 0.7% (1/143) of patients who received ENHERTU. The incidence of treatment-emergent neutralizing antibodies against fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 0% (0/249). During the median 4.6-month treatment period in HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma patients in DESTINY-Gastric01 with a median ADA sampling period of 4.6 months, treatment-emergent ADA developed in 7.3% (9/123) of patients who received ENHERTU. The incidence of treatment-emergent neutralizing antibodies against fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 0% (0/123). Due to the limited number of patients who tested positive for ADA, the effect of treatment-emergent ADAs and treatment-emergent neutralizing antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and/or effectiveness of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is unknown."

Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on DXd: Coadministration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with multiple doses of ENHERTU increased steady state AUC 0-17 days of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki by 11% and DXd by 18%. The impact of these changes is not clinically meaningful. Effect of OATP Inhibitors on DXd: Coadministration of ritonavir, a dual inhibitor of OATP1B/CYP3A, with multiple doses of ENHERTU increased steady state AUC 0-17 days of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki by 19% and DXd by 22%. The impact of these changes is not clinically meaningful. In Vitro Studies Effects of DXd on CYP Enzymes: DXd does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A nor induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A. Effects of DXd on Transporters: At clinically relevant concentrations (steady-state C max of ~0.2 μmol/L), DXd has a low potential to inhibit OAT1 (IC 50 value of 12.7 μmol/L), OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1 (IC 50 value of 14.4 μmol/L), OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, BCRP, or BSEP transporters. Effects of Other Drugs on DXd: DXd is a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE2-K, P-gp, MRP1, and BCRP."

The topoisomerase inhibitor component of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, DXd, was clastogenic in both an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay and an in vitro Chinese hamster lung chromosome aberration assay and was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay. Fertility studies have not been conducted with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. In a six-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, intravenous administration of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki resulted in spermatid retention at 20 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg (approximately 4 and 9 times the human recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg based on AUC, respectively). Decreased testes and epididymides weights, tubular atrophy/degeneration in testes, and reduced sperm count in epididymides were observed at a dose of 197 mg/kg (19 times the human recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg based on AUC). In a three-month repeat-dose toxicity study in monkeys, intravenous administration of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki resulted in decreased numbers of round spermatids in the testes at seminiferous tubule stages V to VI at ≥30 mg/kg (≥7 times the human recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg based on AUC). Evidence of reversibility was observed in monkeys by the end of a three-month recovery period."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer DESTINY-Breast03 The efficacy of ENHERTU was evaluated in study DESTINY-Breast03 (NCT03529110), a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial that enrolled 524 patients with HER2-positive, unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer who received prior trastuzumab and taxane therapy for metastatic disease or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy. HER2 expression was based on archival tissue tested at a central laboratory prior to enrollment with HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3+ or ISH positive. Patients were excluded for a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids, ILD/pneumonitis at screening, or clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients were also excluded for untreated and symptomatic brain metastases, ECOG performance status >1, or prior treatment with an anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate in the metastatic setting. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg (N=261) or ado-trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg (N=263) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Randomization was stratified by hormone receptor status, prior treatment with pertuzumab, and visceral versus non-visceral disease. Tumor imaging was obtained every 6 weeks and CT/MRI of the brain was mandatory for all patients at baseline. The major efficacy outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 and overall survival (OS). Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was an additional outcome measure. The median age was 54 years (range: 20-83); 80% were <65 years and 99.6% were female. The majority of patients were Asian (60%), White (27%) and Black (3.6%). Eleven percent (11%) of patients were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (63%) or 1 (37%) at baseline. Seventy-three percent had visceral disease, 16% had brain metastases at baseline, 52% were hormone receptor positive (HR+) and 48% of patients had received one line of prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting. The percentage of patients who had not received prior treatment for metastatic disease was 10%. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 1. At the time of the PFS analysis, 16% of patients had died and overall survival (OS) was immature.

Patients were excluded for a history of treated ILD or current ILD at screening. Patients were also excluded for history of clinically significant cardiac disease, active brain metastases, and ECOG performance status >1. HER2 expression was based on archival tissue tested at a central laboratory prior to enrollment with HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3+ or ISH positive. Patients received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor imaging was obtained every 6 weeks and CT/MRI of the brain was mandatory for patients with brain metastases at baseline. The major efficacy outcomes were confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent central review (ICR) using RECIST v1.1 and duration of response (DOR). The median age was 55 years (range: 28-96); 76% of patients were <65 years. All 184 patients were female, and the majority were White (55%) or Asian (38%). Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (55%) or 1 (44%) at baseline. Ninety-two percent had visceral disease, 29% had bone metastases, and 13% had brain metastases. Fifty-three percent were HR+. Sum of diameters of target lesions were <5 cm in 42%, and ≥5 cm in 50% (not evaluable by central review in 8% of patients). The median number of prior cancer regimens in the locally advanced/metastatic setting was 5 (range: 2-17). All patients received prior trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, and 66% had prior pertuzumab. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 14.

The study included 2 cohorts: 494 hormone receptor-positive (HR+) patients and 63 hormone receptor-negative (HR-) patients. HER2-low expression was defined as IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-, as determined at a central laboratory using Ventana's PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody assay. Patients must have received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or have developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who were HR+ must have received at least one endocrine therapy or be ineligible for endocrine therapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg (N=373) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy (N=184, eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, nab paclitaxel, or paclitaxel). Randomization was stratified by HER2 IHC status of tumor samples (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-), number of prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (1 or 2), and HR status/prior CDK4/6i treatment (HR+ with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, HR+ without prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, or HR-). Treatment was administered until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The study excluded patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or ILD/pneumonitis at screening and clinically significant cardiac disease. Patients were also excluded for untreated or symptomatic brain metastases or ECOG performance status >1. The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS in patients with HR+ breast cancer assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1 in the overall population (all randomized HR+ and HR- patients), OS in HR+ patients, and OS in the overall population. The median age was 57 years (range: 28 to 81); 24% were age 65 or older; 99.6% were female; 48% were White, 40% were Asian, and 2% were Black or African American; 3.8% of patients were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (55%) or 1 (45%) at baseline; 58% were IHC 1+, 42% were IHC 2+/ISH-; 70% had liver metastases, 33% had lung metastases, and 6% had brain metastases. In the metastatic setting, patients had a median of 3 prior lines of systemic therapy (range: 1 to 9) with 58% having 1 and 41% having 2 prior chemotherapy regimens; 3.9% were early progressors (progression in the neo/adjuvant setting). In HR+ patients, the median number of prior lines of endocrine therapy was 2 (range: 0 to 9) and 70% had prior CDK4/6i treatment. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 15 and Figures 2 and 3.

Patients were prospectively selected for treatment with ENHERTU based on the presence of activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations by local testing using tissue. Samples from DESTINY-Lung01 were retrospectively tested using Oncomine™ Dx Target Test (Life Technologies Corporation, Tissue-test) and Guardant360 ® CDx test (Guardant Health Inc., Plasma test). Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar for patients in DESTINY-Lung01 and DESTINY-Lung02, except for race (34% Asian vs 79% Asian, respectively). Response rates were consistent across dose levels. Increased rates of ILD/pneumonitis were observed at the higher dose. The approved recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in the DESTINY-Lung02 study is described below [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The efficacy of ENHERTU was evaluated in DESTINY-Lung02, a multicenter, multi-cohort, randomized, blinded, dose-optimization trial. Eligible patients were required to have unresectable or metastatic HER2-mutant non-squamous NSCLC with disease progression after one prior systemic therapy. Patients with a history of steroid dependent ILD/pneumonitis, clinically significant cardiac disease, clinically active brain metastases, and ECOG performance status >1 were excluded. Patients received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor imaging was obtained every 6 weeks and CT/MRI of the brain was mandatory for patients with stable brain metastases at baseline. Results from an interim efficacy analysis in a pre-specified patient cohort are described below. The major efficacy outcomes were confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1 and DOR. The median age was 58 years (range 30 to 78); 69% were female; 79% were Asian, 12% were White, and 10% were other races; 29% had an ECOG performance status of 0 and 71% had 1; 33% had stable brain metastases; 94% had a mutation in the ERBB2 kinase domain and 6% had a mutation in the extracellular domain. The median number of prior regimens was 2 (range: 1 to 12); 100% of patients received prior platinum therapy, 71% received prior immunotherapy, and 44% received both in combination. Fifty percent of patients were never-smokers and 50% were former smokers; 96% of patients had adenocarcinoma histology. Efficacy results are provided in Table 16.

HER2 expression was determined by a central lab on tissue obtained either before or after prior trastuzumab treatment. Patients were excluded for a history of treated or current ILD, a history of clinically significant cardiac disease, active brain metastases, or ECOG performance status >1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU (N=126) 6.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy: irinotecan monotherapy (N=55) 150 mg/m 2 intravenously every 2 weeks or paclitaxel monotherapy (N=7) 80 mg/m 2 intravenously weekly. Randomization was stratified by HER2 status (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+), ECOG performance status (0 or 1), and region (Japan or South Korea). Tumor imaging assessments were performed at screening and every 6 weeks from the first treatment dose. Treatment was administered until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The major efficacy outcomes were ORR assessed by ICR according to RECIST v1.1 and OS in the intent-to-treat population. Additional efficacy outcomes were PFS and DOR. The median age was 66 years (range 28 to 82); 76% were male; and 100% were Asian. All patients received a trastuzumab product. Patients had an ECOG performance status of either 0 (49%) or 1 (51%); 87% had gastric adenocarcinoma and 13% had GEJ adenocarcinoma; 76% were IHC 3+ and 23% were IHC 2+/ISH+; 65% had inoperable advanced cancer; 35% had postoperative recurrent cancer; 54% had liver metastases; 29% had lung metastases; 45% had three or more prior regimens in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. A total of 30% of patients were identified as HER2-positive using tissue obtained following prior treatment with a trastuzumab product. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 17, and the Kaplan-Meier curve for OS is shown in Figure 4.
