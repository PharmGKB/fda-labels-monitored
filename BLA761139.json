Symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) Permanently discontinue ENHERTU. 2.4 Preparation for Administration In order to prevent medication errors, check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) and not trastuzumab or ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Reconstitute and further dilute ENHERTU prior to intravenous infusion. Use appropriate aseptic technique. ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Reconstitution Reconstitute immediately before dilution. More than one vial may be needed for a full dose. Calculate the dose (mg), the total volume of reconstituted ENHERTU solution required, and the number of vial(s) of ENHERTU needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Reconstitute each 100 mg vial by using a sterile syringe to slowly inject 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP into each vial to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/mL. Swirl the vial gently until completely dissolved. Do not shake . Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution should be clear and colorless to light yellow. Do not use if visible particles are observed or if the solution is cloudy or discolored. If not used immediately, store the reconstituted ENHERTU vials in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours from the time of reconstitution, protected from light. Do not freeze . The product does not contain a preservative. Discard unused ENHERTU after 24 hours refrigerated. Dilution Dilute the calculated volume of reconstituted ENHERTU in an intravenous infusion bag containing 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. Do not use Sodium Chloride Injection, USP . ENHERTU is compatible with an infusion bag made of polyvinylchloride or polyolefin (copolymer of ethylene and polypropylene). Gently invert the infusion bag to thoroughly mix the solution. Do not shake . Cover the infusion bag to protect from light. If not used immediately, store at room temperature for up to 4 hours including preparation and infusion, or in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours, protected from light. Do not freeze . Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Administration If the prepared infusion solution was stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F]), allow the solution to reach room temperature prior to administration. Administer ENHERTU as an intravenous infusion only with an infusion set made of polyolefin or polybutadiene and a 0.20 or 0.22 micron in-line polyethersulfone (PES) or polysulfone (PS) filter. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Do not mix ENHERTU with other drugs or administer other drugs through the same intravenous line."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia: Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Manage through treatment interruption or dose reduction. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) Left Ventricular Dysfunction: Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage through treatment interruption or discontinuation. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF). ( 2.3 , 5.3 ) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD, consider corticosteroid treatment (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). Withhold ENHERTU until recovery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In cases of symptomatic ILD (Grade 2 or greater), promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients who are diagnosed with symptomatic (Grade 2 or greater) ILD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Metastatic Breast Cancer In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3). Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer In DESTINY-Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21.0). 5.2 Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Metastatic Breast Cance r In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients. Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer In DESTINY-Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. 5.3 Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY-Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on echocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF less than 50% prior to initiation of treatment. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of less than 40% or absolute decrease from baseline of greater than 20% is confirmed. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In postmarketing reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Based on its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase inhibitor component of ENHERTU, DXd, can also cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

Metastatic Breast Cancer The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31). In the pooled 234 patients, the median age was 56 years (range: 28-96), 74% of patients were <65 years, 99.6% of patients were female, and the majority were White (51%) or Asian (42%). Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (58%) or 1 (42%) at baseline. Ninety-four percent had visceral disease, 31% had bone metastases, and 13% had brain metastases. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock. ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea, white blood cell count decreased, hemoglobin decreased, neutrophil count decreased, fatigue, vomiting, alopecia, aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, platelet count decreased, constipation, decreased appetite, anemia, diarrhea, hypokalemia, and cough. Tables 3 and 4 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in ENHERTU-treated patients.

Patients intravenously received at least one dose of either ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m 2 biweekly or paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m 2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: 0.7 to 22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5 to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, pneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient each (0.8%). ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, leukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, and febrile neutropenia. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased, white blood cell decreased, neutrophil count decreased, lymphocyte count decreased, platelet count decreased, nausea, decreased appetite, anemia, aspartate aminotransferase increased, fatigue, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, diarrhea, hypokalemia, vomiting, constipation, blood bilirubin increased, pyrexia, and alopecia.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparisons of the incidence of antibodies to ENHERTU in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Treatment-induced anti-fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki antibodies (ADA) developed in 1.7% (14/807) patients who received ENHERTU across all doses. Due to the limited number of patients who tested positive for ADA, no conclusions can be drawn concerning a potential effect of immunogenicity on efficacy or safety. In addition, neutralizing activity of anti-ENHERTU antibodies has not been assessed."

( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of ENHERTU in pregnant women. In postmarketing reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death ( see Data ). Based on its mechanism of action, the topoisomerase inhibitor component of ENHERTU, DXd, can also cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU ( see Clinical Considerations ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received ENHERTU during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. Data Human Data There are no available data on the use of ENHERTU in pregnant women. In postmarketing reports in pregnant women receiving a HER2-directed antibody, cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death have been reported. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received a HER2-directed antibody either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In some case reports, amniotic fluid index increased after use of a HER2-directed antibody was stopped. Animal Data There were no animal reproductive or developmental toxicity studies conducted with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data regarding the presence of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception Females ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings in animal toxicity studies, ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were 65 years or older and 5% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged 65 years or older (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Gastric01, 56% were 65 years or older and 14% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of ENHERTU is required in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥60 and <90 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr ≥30 and <60 mL/min) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No data are available in patients with severe renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of ENHERTU is required in patients with mild (total bilirubin ≤ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) or moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. No data are available in patients with severe (total bilirubin >3 to 10 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "11 DESCRIPTION Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of three components: 1) a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), covalently linked to 2) a topoisomerase inhibitor, via 3) a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. Deruxtecan is composed of a protease-cleavable maleimide tetrapeptide linker and the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd, which is an exatecan derivative. The antibody is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology, and the topoisomerase inhibitor and linker are produced by chemical synthesis. Approximately 8 molecules of deruxtecan are attached to each antibody molecule. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki has the following structure: ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a sterile, white to yellowish white, preservative-free lyophilized powder in single-dose vials. Each vial delivers 100 mg of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, L-histidine (4.45 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (20.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.5 mg), and sucrose (450 mg). Following reconstitution with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the resulting concentration of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is 20 mg/mL with a pH of 5.5. The resulting solution is administered by intravenous infusion following dilution. Chemical Structure"

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody is a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1. The small molecule, DXd, is a topoisomerase I inhibitor attached to the antibody by a cleavable linker. Following binding to HER2 on tumor cells, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki undergoes internalization and intracellular linker cleavage by lysosomal enzymes. Upon release, the membrane-permeable DXd causes DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The administration of multiple doses of ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks did not show a large mean effect (i.e. >20 ms) on the QTc interval in an open-label, single-arm study in 51 patients with metastatic HER2-positive cancer. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was evaluated in patients with cancer. Following a single dose, exposures (C max and AUC) of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and released topoisomerase inhibitor (DXd) increased proportionally over a dose range of 3.2 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg (approximately 0.6 to 1.5 times the recommended dose). Metastatic Breast Cancer At the recommended dosage of ENHERTU for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation [CV]%) C max of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 122 µg/mL (20%) and 4.4 ng/mL (40%), respectively, and the AUC of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 735 µg∙day/mL (31%) and 28 ng∙day/mL (38%), respectively, based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. Accumulation of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was approximately 35% at steady-state (Cycle 3). Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer At the recommended dosage of ENHERTU for patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer, the geometric mean C max,ss of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 126 µg/mL (18%) and 5.2 ng/mL (42%), respectively, and the AUC ss of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and DXd were 743 µg∙day/mL (26%) and 33 ng∙day/mL (43%), respectively, based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. Accumulation of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was approximately 39% at steady-state (Cycle 3). Distribution Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated volume of distribution of the central compartment (V c ) of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 2.78 L. For humans, DXd plasma protein binding is approximately 97% and the blood-to-plasma ratio is approximately 0.6, in vitro. Elimination The median elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and gastric cancer was approximately 5.7-5.8 days. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated systemic clearance of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki was 0.42 L/day. The median apparent elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of DXd in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and gastric cancer was approximately 5.5-5.8 days. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated apparent systemic clearance of DXd was 19.6 L/h. Metabolism The humanized HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. In vitro, DXd is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki or DXd were observed for age (23-96 years), race (Asian [n=563] and non-Asian [n=245]), sex, body weight (27.3-125.4 kg), mild (total bilirubin ≤ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST, n=312) hepatic impairment, mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥60 and <90 mL/min, n=292) or moderate (CLcr ≥30 and <60 mL/min, n=54) renal impairment based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. The pharmacokinetics of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki or DXd in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 ULN with any AST) or severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on DXd: Coadministration of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, with multiple doses of ENHERTU increased steady state AUC 0-17 days of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki by 11% and DXd by 18%. The impact of these changes is not clinically meaningful. Effect of OATP Inhibitors on DXd: Coadministration of ritonavir, a dual inhibitor of OATP1B/CYP3A, with multiple doses of ENHERTU increased steady state AUC 0-17 days of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki by 19% and DXd by 22%. The impact of these changes is not clinically meaningful. In Vitro Studies Effects of DXd on CYP Enzymes: DXd does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A nor induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A. Effects of DXd on Transporters: At clinically relevant concentrations (steady-state C max of ~0.2 μmol/L), DXd has a low potential to inhibit OAT1 (IC 50 value of 12.7 μmol/L), OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1 (IC 50 value of 14.4 μmol/L), OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K, P-gp, BCRP, or BSEP transporters.

Patients were excluded for a history of treated ILD or current ILD at screening. Patients were also excluded for history of clinically significant cardiac disease, active brain metastases, and ECOG performance status >1. HER2 expression was based on archival tissue tested at a central laboratory prior to enrollment with HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3+ or ISH positive. Patients received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor imaging was obtained every 6 weeks and CT/MRI of the brain was mandatory for patients with brain metastases at baseline. The major efficacy outcomes were confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent central review (ICR) using RECIST v1.1 and duration of response (DOR). The median age was 55 years (range: 28-96); 76% of patients were <65 years. All 184 patients were female, and the majority were White (55%) or Asian (38%). Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (55%) or 1 (44%) at baseline. Ninety-two percent had visceral disease, 29% had bone metastases, and 13% had brain metastases. Fifty-three percent were hormone receptor positive. Sum of diameters of target lesions were <5 cm in 42%, and ≥5 cm in 50% (not evaluable by central review in 8% of patients). The median number of prior cancer regimens in the locally advanced/metastatic setting was 5 (range: 2-17). All patients received prior trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, and 66% had prior pertuzumab. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 7.

Median, months (95% CI) Median DOR based on Kaplan-Meier estimate; 95% CI calculated using Brookmeyer-Crowley method 14.8 (13.8, 16.9) 14.2 Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer The efficacy of ENHERTU was evaluated in study DESTINY-Gastric01 (NCT03329690), a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial conducted in Japan and South Korea that enrolled 188 adult patients with HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH positive), locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had progressed on at least two prior regimens including trastuzumab, a fluoropyrimidine- and a platinum-containing chemotherapy. HER2 expression was determined by a central lab on tissue obtained either before or after prior trastuzumab treatment. Patients were excluded for a history of treated or current ILD, a history of clinically significant cardiac disease, active brain metastases, or ECOG performance status >1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU (N=126) 6.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks or physician's choice of chemotherapy: irinotecan monotherapy (N=55) 150 mg/m 2 intravenously every 2 weeks or paclitaxel monotherapy (N=7) 80 mg/m 2 intravenously weekly. Randomization was stratified by HER2 status (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+), ECOG performance status (0 or 1), and region (Japan or South Korea). Tumor imaging assessments were performed at screening and every 6 weeks from the first treatment dose. Treatment was administered until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The major efficacy outcomes were ORR assessed by ICR according to RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat population. Additional efficacy outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and DOR. The median age was 66 years (range 28 to 82); 76% were male; and 100% were Asian. All patients received a trastuzumab product. Patients had an ECOG performance status of either 0 (49%) or 1 (51%); 87% had gastric adenocarcinoma and 13% had GEJ adenocarcinoma; 76% were IHC 3+ and 23% were IHC 2+/ISH+; 65% had inoperable advanced cancer; 35% had postoperative recurrent cancer; 54% had liver metastases; 29% had lung metastases; 45% had three or more prior regimens in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. A total of 30% of patients were identified as HER2-positive using tissue obtained following prior treatment with a trastuzumab product. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 8, and the Kaplan-Meier curve for OS is shown in Figure 1.
