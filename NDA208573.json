      "nonclinical_toxicology": [
        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityNeither venetoclax nor M27, a major human metabolite, were carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse study at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day of venetoclax, and at a single oral dose level of 250 mg/kg/day of M27.Venetoclax was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay, did not induce numerical or structural aberrations in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and was not clastogenic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay at doses up to 835 mg/kg. The M27 metabolite was negative for genotoxic activity in in vitro Ames and chromosome aberration assays.Fertility and early embryonic development studies were conducted in male and female mice. These studies evaluate mating, fertilization, and embryonic development through implantation. There were no effects of venetoclax on estrous cycles, mating, fertility, corpora lutea, uterine implants or live embryos per litter at dosages up to 600 mg/kg/day. However, a risk to human male fertility exists based on testicular toxicity (germ cell loss) observed in dogs at exposures as low as 0.5 times the human AUC exposure at a dose of 400 mg.13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or PharmacologyIn dogs, venetoclax caused single-cell necrosis in various tissues, including the gallbladder, exocrine pancreas, and stomach with no evidence of disruption of tissue integrity or organ dysfunction; these findings were minimal to mild in magnitude. Following a 4-week dosing period and subsequent 4-week recovery period, minimal single-cell necrosis was still present in some tissues and reversibility has not been assessed following longer periods of dosing or recovery. In addition, after approximately 3 months of daily dosing in dogs, venetoclax caused progressive white discoloration of the hair coat, due to loss of melanin pigment."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of ActionVenetoclax is a selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, an anti-apoptotic protein. Overexpression of BCL-2 has been demonstrated in CLL and AML cells where it mediates tumor cell survival and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics. Venetoclax helps restore the process of apoptosis by binding directly to the BCL-2 protein, displacing pro-apoptotic proteins like BIM, triggering mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the activation of caspases. In nonclinical studies, venetoclax has demonstrated cytotoxic activity in tumor cells that overexpress BCL-2."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 PharmacokineticsVenetoclax mean (± standard deviation) steady state Cmax was 2.1 ± 1.1 mcg/mL and AUC0-24 was32.8 ± 16.9 mcg•h/mL following administration of 400 mg once daily with a low-fat meal. Venetoclax steady state AUC increased proportionally over the dose range of 150 to 800 mg (0.25 to 1.33 times the maximum approved recommended dosage). The pharmacokinetics of venetoclax does not change over time.AbsorptionMaximum plasma concentration of venetoclax was reached 5 to 8 hours following multiple oral administration under fed conditions. Effect of FoodAdministration with a low-fat meal (approximately 512 kilocalories, 25% fat calories, 60% carbohydrate calories, and 15% protein calories) increased venetoclax exposure by approximately 3.4-fold and administration with a high-fat meal (approximately 753 kilocalories, 55% fat calories, 28% carbohydrate calories, and 17% protein calories) increased venetoclax exposure by 5.1- to 5.3-fold compared with fasting conditions. DistributionVenetoclax is highly bound to human plasma protein with unbound fraction in plasma <0.01 across a concentration range of 1-30 micromolar (0.87-26 mcg/mL). The mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.57. The apparent volume of distribution (Vdss/F) of venetoclax ranged from 256-321 L in patients. EliminationThe terminal elimination half-life of venetoclax was approximately 26 hours. MetabolismVenetoclax is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A in vitro. The major metabolite identified in plasma, M27, has an inhibitory activity against BCL-2 that is at least 58-fold lower than venetoclax in vitro and its AUC represented 80% of the parent AUC. ExcretionAfter single oral dose of radiolabeled [14C]-venetoclax 200 mg to healthy subjects, > 99.9% of the dose was recovered in feces (20.8% as unchanged) and < 0.1% in urine within 9 days. Specific PopulationsNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax were observed based on age (19 to 90 years), sex, race (White, Black, Asians, and Others), weight, mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min, calculated by Cockcroft-Gault), or mild to moderate hepatic impairment (normal total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase (AST) > upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin 1 to 3 times ULN). The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) or dialysis on venetoclax pharmacokinetics is unknown. Patients with Hepatic ImpairmentFollowing a single dose of VENCLEXTA 50 mg, venetoclax systemic exposure (AUCinf) was 2.7-fold higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. No clinically relevant differences in venetoclax systemic exposure were observed between subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function.Drug Interactions StudiesClinical StudiesNo clinically significant differences in venetoclax pharmacokinetics were observed when co-administered with azacitidine, azithromycin, cytarabine, decitabine, gastric acid reducing agents, obinutuzumab, or rituximab.KetoconazoleConcomitant use of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) 400 mg once daily for 7 days increased venetoclax Cmax by 130% and AUCinf by 540% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].RitonavirConcomitant use of ritonavir (a strong CYP3A, P-gp and OATP1B1/B3 inhibitor) 50 mg once daily for 14 days increased venetoclax Cmax by 140% and AUC by 690% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].Posaconazole Concomitant use of posaconazole (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor) 300 mg with venetoclax 50 mg and 100 mg for 7 days resulted in 61% and 86% higher venetoclax Cmax, respectively, compared with venetoclax 400 mg administered alone. The venetoclax AUC24 was 90% and 144% higher, respectively.RifampinConcomitant use of a single dose of rifampin(an OATP1B1/1B3 and P-gp inhibitor) 600 mg increased venetoclax Cmax by 106% and AUCinf by 78%. Concomitant use of multiple doses of rifampin (as a strong CYP3A inducer) 600 mg once daily for 13 days decreased venetoclax Cmax by 42% and AUCinf by 71% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. WarfarinConcomitant use of a single 400 mg dose of venetoclax with 5 mg warfarin resulted in 18% to 28% increase in Cmax and AUCinf of R-warfarin and S-warfarin [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].DigoxinConcomitant use of a single dose of venetoclax 100 mg with digoxin (a P-gp substrate) 0.5 mg increased digoxin Cmax by 35% and AUCinf by 9% [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].In Vitro StudiesVenetoclax is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4. Venetoclax is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and UGT1A1.Venetoclax is not an inhibitor of UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. Venetoclax is an inhibitor and substrate of P-gp and BCRP and weak inhibitor of OATP1B1. Venetoclax is not an inhibitor of OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, or MATE2K."

Clinical signs of toxicity included decreased activity, dehydration, skin pallor, and hunched posture at ≥30 mg/kg/day. In addition, mortality and body weight effects occurred at 100 mg/kg/day. Other venetoclax-related effects were reversible decreases in lymphocytes at ≥10 mg/kg/day; a dose of 10 mg/kg/day is approximately 0.06 times the clinical dose of 400 mg on a mg/m2 basis for a 20 kg child."

Based on toxicity observed in mice, VENCLEXTA may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In mice, venetoclax was fetotoxic at exposures 1.2 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC at a human dose of 400 mg daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. DataAnimal dataIn embryo-fetal development studies, venetoclax was administered to pregnant mice and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. In mice, venetoclax was associated with increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body weight at 150 mg/kg/day (maternal exposures approximately 1.2 times the human AUC exposure at a dose of 400 mg daily). No teratogenicity was observed in either the mouse or the rabbit."

Venetoclax was present in the milk when administered to lactating rats (see Data).Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from VENCLEXTA is unknown, advise nursing women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with VENCLEXTA. DataAnimal DataVenetoclax was administered (single dose; 150 mg/kg oral) to lactating rats 8 to 10 days parturition. Venetoclax in milk was 1.6 times lower than in plasma.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSTumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Anticipate TLS; assess risk in all patients. Premedicate with anti-hyperuricemics and ensure adequate hydration. Employ more intensive measures (intravenous hydration, frequent monitoring, hospitalization) as overall risk increases. (2.2, 5.1)Neutropenia: Monitor blood counts and for signs of infection; manage as medically appropriate. (2.3, 5.2)Infections: Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection and treat promptly. Withhold treatment for Grade 3 and higher infection until resolution. (5.3)Immunization: Do not administer live attenuated vaccines prior to, during, or after VENCLEXTA treatment. (5.4)Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: May cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment. (5.5)Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with VENCLEXTA in combination with bortezomib plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. (5.6)5.1 Tumor Lysis SyndromeTumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal events and renal failure requiring dialysis, has occurred in patients with high tumor burden when treated with VENCLEXTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. In patients with CLL who followed the current (5 week) dose ramp-up and the TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures, the rate of TLS was 2% in the VENCLEXTA CLL monotherapy studies. The rate of TLS remained consistent with VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab. With a 2 to 3 week dose ramp-up and higher starting dose in patients with CLL/SLL, the TLS rate was 13% and included deaths and renal failure [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].VENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS at initiation and during the ramp-up phase. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase.The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including tumor burden and comorbidities. Reduced renal function further increases the risk. Patients should be assessed for risk and should receive appropriate prophylaxis for TLS, including hydration and anti-hyperuricemics. Monitor blood chemistries and manage abnormalities promptly. Interrupt dosing if needed. Employ more intensive measures (intravenous hydration, frequent monitoring, hospitalization) as overall risk increases [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].Concomitant use of VENCLEXTA with P-gp inhibitors or strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors increases venetoclax exposure, may increase the risk of TLS at initiation and during ramp-up phase and requires VENCLEXTA dose adjustment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].5.2 NeutropeniaIn patients with CLL, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia developed in 63% to 64% of patients and Grade 4 neutropenia developed in 31% to 33% of patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination and monotherapy studies (see Tables 10, 12, 14). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 4% to 6% of patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination and monotherapy studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].In patients with AML, baseline neutrophil counts worsened in 97% to 100% of patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine or decitabine or low-dose cytarabine. Neutropenia can recur with subsequent cycles of therapy.Monitor complete blood counts throughout the treatment period. Interrupt dosing or reduce dose for severe neutropenia. Consider supportive measures including antimicrobials for signs of infection and use of growth factors (e.g., G-CSF) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].5.3 InfectionsFatal and serious infections such as pneumonia and sepsis have occurred in patients treated with VENCLEXTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of infection and treat promptly. Withhold VENCLEXTA for Grade 3 and higher infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].5.4 ImmunizationDo not administer live attenuated vaccines prior to, during, or after treatment with VENCLEXTA until B-cell recovery occurs. The safety and efficacy of immunization with live attenuated vaccines during or following VENCLEXTA therapy have not been studied. Advise patients that vaccinations may be less effective.5.5 Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, VENCLEXTA may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an embryo-fetal study conducted in mice, administration of venetoclax to pregnant animals at exposures equivalent to that observed in patients at a dose of 400 mg daily resulted in post-implantation loss and decreased fetal weight. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using VENCLEXTA. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy during treatment. If VENCLEXTA is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking VENCLEXTA, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].5.6 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when VENCLEXTA is Added to Bortezomib and DexamethasoneIn a randomized trial (BELLINI; NCT02755597) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, the addition of VENCLEXTA to bortezomib plus dexamethasone, a use for which VENCLEXTA is not indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with VENCLEXTA in combination with bortezomib plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.",

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONSee Full Prescribing Information for recommended VENCLEXTA starting and ramp-up dosages. (2.1)VENCLEXTA tablets should be taken orally once daily with a meal and water. Do not chew, crush, or break tablets. (2.1)Perform prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome. (2.2)2.1 Recommended DosageAssess patient-specific factors for level of risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Instruct patients to take VENCLEXTA tablets with a meal and water at approximately the same time each day. VENCLEXTA tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, or broken prior to swallowing. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic LymphomaVENCLEXTA dosing begins with a 5-week ramp-up.VENCLEXTA 5-week Dose Ramp-Up ScheduleAdminister the VENCLEXTA dose according to a weekly ramp-up schedule over 5 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 400 mg as shown in Table 1. The 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule is designed to gradually reduce tumor burden (debulk) and decrease the risk of TLS. Table 1. Dosing Schedule for Ramp-Up Phase in Patients with CLL/SLL VENCLEXTA Daily DoseWeek 120 mgWeek 250 mgWeek 3100 mgWeek 4200 mgWeek 5 and beyond400 mgThe CLL/SLL Starting Pack provides the first 4 weeks of VENCLEXTA according to the ramp-up schedule. The 400 mg dose is achieved using 100 mg tablets supplied in bottles [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. VENCLEXTA in Combination with ObinutuzumabStart obinutuzumab administration at 100 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed by 900 mg on Cycle 1 Day 2. Administer 1000 mg on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle, for a total of 6 cycles. Refer to the obinutuzumab prescribing information for recommended obinutuzumab dosing information.On Cycle 1 Day 22, start VENCLEXTA according to the 5-week ramp-up schedule (see Table 1). After completing the ramp-up schedule on Cycle 2 Day 28, patients should continue VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily from Cycle 3 Day 1 until the last day of Cycle 12.VENCLEXTA in Combination with RituximabStart rituximab administration after the patient has completed the 5-week dose ramp-up schedule with VENCLEXTA (see Table 1) and has received the 400 mg dose of VENCLEXTA for 7 days. Administer rituximab on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles, with rituximab dosed at 375 mg/m2 intravenously for Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m2 intravenously for Cycles 2-6. Patients should continue VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily for 24 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of rituximab.VENCLEXTA as MonotherapyThe recommended dose of VENCLEXTA is 400 mg once daily after the patient has completed the 5-week dose ramp-up schedule. VENCLEXTA should be taken orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed. Acute Myeloid LeukemiaThe dose of VENCLEXTA depends upon the combination agent.The VENCLEXTA dosing schedule (including ramp-up) is shown in Table 2. Initiate the azacitidine or decitabine or low-dose cytarabine on Day 1.Table 2.

Refer to the appropriate section below for specific details on management. Assess patient-specific factors for level of risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS.Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic LymphomaVENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week ramp-up phase. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase.The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, including tumor burden and comorbidities. Reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] <80 mL/min) further increases the risk. Perform tumor burden assessments, including radiographic evaluation (e.g., CT scan), assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) in all patients and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA. The risk may decrease as tumor burden decreases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].Table 3 below describes the recommended TLS prophylaxis and monitoring during VENCLEXTA treatment based on tumor burden determination from clinical trial data. Consider all patient comorbidities before final determination of prophylaxis and monitoring schedule.Table 3.

Cytoreduction prior to treatment may be required.Prior to first VENCLEXTA dose, provide all patients with prophylactic measures including adequate hydration and anti-hyperuricemic agents and continue during ramp-up phase.Assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA.Monitor blood chemistries for TLS at pre-dose, 6 to 8 hours after each new dose during ramp-up and 24 hours after reaching final dose. For patients with risk factors for TLS (e.g., circulating blasts, high burden of leukemia involvement in bone marrow, elevated pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, or reduced renal function) additional measures should be considered, including increased laboratory monitoring and reducing VENCLEXTA starting dose.2.3 Dosage Modifications Based on ToxicitiesChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic LymphomaInterrupt dosing or reduce dose for toxicities. See Table 4 and Table 5 for recommended dose modifications for toxicities related to VENCLEXTA. For patients who have had a dosing interruption greater than 1 week during the first 5 weeks of ramp-up phase or greater than 2 weeks after completing the ramp-up phase, reassess for risk of TLS to determine if reinitiation with a reduced dose is necessary (e.g., all or some levels of the dose ramp-up schedule) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic LymphomaCLL14The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) versus obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) was evaluated in a randomized, open-label, actively controlled trial in patients with previously untreated CLL [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].Patients randomized to the VEN+G arm were treated with VENCLEXTA and obinutuzumab in combination for six cycles, then with VENCLEXTA as monotherapy for an additional six cycles. Patients initiated the first dose of the 5-week ramp-up for VENCLEXTA on Day 22 of Cycle 1 and once completed, continued VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily for a total of 12 cycles. The trial required a total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) >6 or CLcr <70 mL/min, hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin ≤2 times upper limit of normal, and excluded patients with any individual organ/system impairment score of 4 by CIRS except eye, ear, nose, and throat organ system.A total of 426 patients were treated (212 with VEN+G, 214 with GClb). The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 10.5 months (range: 0 to 13.5 months). The median number of cycles was 6 for obinutuzumab and 12 for chlorambucil.In the VEN+G arm, fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 28 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2% (4/212) of patients, most often from infection. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 49% of patients in the VEN+G arm, most often due to febrile neutropenia and pneumonia (5% each).In the VEN+G arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 21%, and dose interruption in 74%. In the VEN+G arm, neutropenia led to dose interruption of VENCLEXTA in 41% of patients, reduction in 13%, and discontinuation in 2%.Table 9 and Table 10 present adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities identified in the CLL14 trial, respectively. The most common (≥15%) adverse reactions observed with VEN+G were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, anemia, and upper respiratory tract infection.Table 9.

Patients randomized to VEN+R completed the scheduled ramp-up (5 weeks) and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily in combination with rituximab for 6 cycles followed by single agent VENCLEXTA for a total of 24 months after ramp-up. Patients randomized to B+R received 6 cycles (28 days per cycle) for a total of 6 months.At the time of analysis, the median duration of exposure was 22 months in the VEN+R arm compared with 6 months in the B+R arm.In the VEN+R arm, fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of the last VENCLEXTA treatment and/or 90 days of last rituximab were reported in 2% (4/194) of patients. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 46% of patients in the VEN+R arm, with most frequent (≥5%) being pneumonia (9%).In the VEN+R arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 15%, and dose interruption in 71%. In the B+R arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 10% of patients, dose reduction in 15%, and dose interruption in 40%. In the VEN+R arm, neutropenia led to dose interruption of VENCLEXTA in 46% of patients and discontinuation in 3%, and thrombocytopenia led to discontinuation in 3% of patients.

In the pooled dataset, consisting of 352 patients with previously treated CLL or SLL, the median age was 66 years (range: 28 to 85 years), 93% were white, and 68% were male. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 0 to 15). The median duration of treatment with VENCLEXTA at the time of data analysis was 14.5 months (range: 0 to 50 months). Fifty-two percent of patients received VENCLEXTA for more than 60 weeks.Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of venetoclax treatment were reported in 2% of patients in the VENCLEXTA monotherapy studies, most commonly (2 patients) from septic shock. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 52% of patients, with the most frequent (≥5%) being pneumonia (9%), febrile neutropenia (5%), and sepsis (5%).Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 9% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 36%. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The most frequent adverse reaction (≥5%) leading to dose reductions or interruptions was neutropenia (8%).Adverse reactions identified in these trials of single-agent VENCLEXTA are presented in Table 13.Table 13.

All three events of TLS resolved and did not lead to withdrawal from the study. Obinutuzumab administration was delayed in two cases in response to the TLS events.MURANOIn the open-label randomized phase 3 study, the incidence of TLS was 3% (6/194) in patients treated with VEN+R. After 77/389 patients were enrolled in the study, the protocol was amended to incorporate the current TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in sections 2.1 and 2.2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. All events of TLS occurred during the VENCLEXTA ramp-up period and were resolved within two days. All six patients completed the ramp-up and reached the recommended daily dose of 400 mg of VENCLEXTA. No clinical TLS was observed in patients who followed the current 5-week ramp-up schedule and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in sections 2.1 and 2.2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. Rates of laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS for patients treated with VEN+R are presented in Table 12.Monotherapy Studies (M13-982 and M14-032)In 168 patients with CLL treated according to recommendations described in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the rate of TLS was 2% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. All events either met laboratory TLS criteria (laboratory abnormalities that met ≥2 of the following within 24 hours of each other: potassium >6 mmol/L, uric acid >476 µmol/L, calcium <1.75 mmol/L, or phosphorus >1.5 mmol/L); or were reported as TLS events. The events occurred in patients who had a lymph node(s) ≥5 cm and/or ALC ≥25 x 109/L. All events resolved within 5 days. No TLS with clinical consequences such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias or sudden death and/or seizures was observed in these patients. All patients had CLcr ≥50 mL/min. Laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS were hyperkalemia (17% all Grades, 1% Grade ≥3), hyperphosphatemia (14% all Grades, 2% Grade ≥3), hypocalcemia (16% all Grades, 2% Grade ≥3), and hyperuricemia (10% all Grades, <1% Grade ≥3).In the initial Phase 1 dose-finding trials, which had shorter (2-3 week) ramp-up phase and higher starting doses, the incidence of TLS was 13% (10/77; 5 laboratory TLS, 5 clinical TLS), including 2 fatal events and 3 events of acute renal failure, 1 requiring dialysis. After this experience, TLS risk assessment, dosing regimen, TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures were revised [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].Acute Myeloid LeukemiaThe safety of VENCLEXTA (400 mg daily dose) in combination with azacitidine (n=67) or decitabine (n= 13) and VENCLEXTA (600 mg daily dose) in combination with low-dose cytarabine (n= 61) is based on two non-randomized trials of patients with newly-diagnosed AML [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The median duration of exposure for patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine and decitabine was 6.5 months (range: 0.1 to 31.9 months) and 8.4 months (range: 0.5 to 22.3 months), respectively. The median duration of exposure for patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with low dose cytarabine was 3.9 months (range: 0.2 to 29.2 months).VENCLEXTA in Combination with Azacitidine or DecitabineAzacitidineThe most common adverse reactions (≥30%) of any grade were nausea, diarrhea, constipation, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, peripheral edema, vomiting, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, rash, and anemia. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 75% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥5%) were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia (excluding fungal), sepsis (excluding fungal), respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The incidence of fatal adverse drug reactions was 1.5% within 30 days of starting treatment. No reaction had an incidence of ≥2%.Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation (≥2%) were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia (excluding fungal).Dosage interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 61% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption (≥5%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia (excluding fungal).

        "6.1 Clinical Trials ExperienceBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely variable conditions, adverse event rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates of clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic LymphomaCLL14The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) versus obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) was evaluated in a randomized, open-label, actively controlled trial in patients with previously untreated CLL [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].Patients randomized to the VEN+G arm were treated with VENCLEXTA and obinutuzumab in combination for six cycles, then with VENCLEXTA as monotherapy for an additional six cycles. Patients initiated the first dose of the 5-week ramp-up for VENCLEXTA on Day 22 of Cycle 1 and once completed, continued VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily for a total of 12 cycles. The trial required a total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) >6 or CLcr <70 mL/min, hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin ≤2 times upper limit of normal, and excluded patients with any individual organ/system impairment score of 4 by CIRS except eye, ear, nose, and throat organ system.A total of 426 patients were treated (212 with VEN+G, 214 with GClb). The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 10.5 months (range: 0 to 13.5 months). The median number of cycles was 6 for obinutuzumab and 12 for chlorambucil.In the VEN+G arm, fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 28 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2% (4/212) of patients, most often from infection. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 49% of patients in the VEN+G arm, most often due to febrile neutropenia and pneumonia (5% each).In the VEN+G arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 21%, and dose interruption in 74%. In the VEN+G arm, neutropenia led to dose interruption of VENCLEXTA in 41% of patients, reduction in 13%, and discontinuation in 2%.Table 9 and Table 10 present adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities identified in the CLL14 trial, respectively. The most common (≥15%) adverse reactions observed with VEN+G were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, anemia, and upper respiratory tract infection.Table 9.

Serious adverse reactions were reported in 46% of patients in the VEN+R arm, with most frequent (≥5%) being pneumonia (9%).In the VEN+R arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 15%, and dose interruption in 71%. In the B+R arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 10% of patients, dose reduction in 15%, and dose interruption in 40%. In the VEN+R arm, neutropenia led to dose interruption of VENCLEXTA in 46% of patients and discontinuation in 3%, and thrombocytopenia led to discontinuation in 3% of patients.

In the pooled dataset, consisting of 352 patients with previously treated CLL or SLL, the median age was 66 years (range: 28 to 85 years), 93% were white, and 68% were male. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 0 to 15). The median duration of treatment with VENCLEXTA at the time of data analysis was 14.5 months (range: 0 to 50 months). Fifty-two percent of patients received VENCLEXTA for more than 60 weeks.Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of venetoclax treatment were reported in 2% of patients in the VENCLEXTA monotherapy studies, most commonly (2 patients) from septic shock. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 52% of patients, with the most frequent (≥5%) being pneumonia (9%), febrile neutropenia (5%), and sepsis (5%).Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 9% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 36%. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The most frequent adverse reaction (≥5%) leading to dose reductions or interruptions was neutropenia (8%).Adverse reactions identified in these trials of single-agent VENCLEXTA are presented in Table 13.Table 13.

All three events of TLS resolved and did not lead to withdrawal from the study. Obinutuzumab administration was delayed in two cases in response to the TLS events.MURANOIn the open-label randomized phase 3 study, the incidence of TLS was 3% (6/194) in patients treated with VEN+R. After 77/389 patients were enrolled in the study, the protocol was amended to incorporate the current TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in sections 2.1 and 2.2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. All events of TLS occurred during the VENCLEXTA ramp-up period and were resolved within two days. All six patients completed the ramp-up and reached the recommended daily dose of 400 mg of VENCLEXTA. No clinical TLS was observed in patients who followed the current 5-week ramp-up schedule and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in sections 2.1 and 2.2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. Rates of laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS for patients treated with VEN+R are presented in Table 12.Monotherapy Studies (M13-982 and M14-032)In 168 patients with CLL treated according to recommendations described in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the rate of TLS was 2% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. All events either met laboratory TLS criteria (laboratory abnormalities that met ≥2 of the following within 24 hours of each other: potassium >6 mmol/L, uric acid >476 µmol/L, calcium <1.75 mmol/L, or phosphorus >1.5 mmol/L); or were reported as TLS events. The events occurred in patients who had a lymph node(s) ≥5 cm and/or ALC ≥25 x 109/L. All events resolved within 5 days. No TLS with clinical consequences such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias or sudden death and/or seizures was observed in these patients. All patients had CLcr ≥50 mL/min. Laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS were hyperkalemia (17% all Grades, 1% Grade ≥3), hyperphosphatemia (14% all Grades, 2% Grade ≥3), hypocalcemia (16% all Grades, 2% Grade ≥3), and hyperuricemia (10% all Grades, <1% Grade ≥3).In the initial Phase 1 dose-finding trials, which had shorter (2-3 week) ramp-up phase and higher starting doses, the incidence of TLS was 13% (10/77; 5 laboratory TLS, 5 clinical TLS), including 2 fatal events and 3 events of acute renal failure, 1 requiring dialysis. After this experience, TLS risk assessment, dosing regimen, TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures were revised [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].Acute Myeloid LeukemiaThe safety of VENCLEXTA (400 mg daily dose) in combination with azacitidine (n=67) or decitabine (n= 13) and VENCLEXTA (600 mg daily dose) in combination with low-dose cytarabine (n= 61) is based on two non-randomized trials of patients with newly-diagnosed AML [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The median duration of exposure for patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine and decitabine was 6.5 months (range: 0.1 to 31.9 months) and 8.4 months (range: 0.5 to 22.3 months), respectively. The median duration of exposure for patients taking VENCLEXTA in combination with low dose cytarabine was 3.9 months (range: 0.2 to 29.2 months).VENCLEXTA in Combination with Azacitidine or DecitabineAzacitidineThe most common adverse reactions (≥30%) of any grade were nausea, diarrhea, constipation, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, peripheral edema, vomiting, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, rash, and anemia. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 75% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥5%) were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia (excluding fungal), sepsis (excluding fungal), respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The incidence of fatal adverse drug reactions was 1.5% within 30 days of starting treatment. No reaction had an incidence of ≥2%.Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation (≥2%) were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia (excluding fungal).Dosage interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 61% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption (≥5%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia (excluding fungal). Dosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to dose reduction (≥5%) was neutropenia.DecitabineThe most common adverse reactions (≥30%) of any grade were febrile neutropenia, constipation, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, abdominal pain, dizziness, hemorrhage, nausea, pneumonia (excluding fungal), sepsis (excluding fungal), cough, diarrhea, neutropenia, back pain, hypotension, myalgia, oropharyngeal pain, peripheral edema, pyrexia, and rash. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 85% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥5%) were febrile neutropenia, sepsis (excluding fungal), pneumonia (excluding fungal), diarrhea, fatigue, cellulitis, and localized infection. One (8%) fatal adverse drug reaction of bacteremia occurred within 30 days of starting treatment.Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to drug discontinuation (≥5%) was pneumonia (excluding fungal).Dosage interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption (≥5%) were febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and pneumonia (excluding fungal).Dosage reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients.

Following a 4-week dosing period and subsequent 4-week recovery period, minimal single-cell necrosis was still present in some tissues and reversibility has not been assessed following longer periods of dosing or recovery. In addition, after approximately 3 months of daily dosing in dogs, venetoclax caused progressive white discoloration of the hair coat, due to loss of melanin pigment."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSLactation: Advise women not to breastfeed. (8.2)Hepatic Impairment: Reduce the VENCLEXTA dose by 50% in patients with severe hepatic impairment. (2.5, 8.7)8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryThere are no available data on VENCLEXTA use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. Based on toxicity observed in mice, VENCLEXTA may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In mice, venetoclax was fetotoxic at exposures 1.2 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC at a human dose of 400 mg daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. DataAnimal dataIn embryo-fetal development studies, venetoclax was administered to pregnant mice and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. In mice, venetoclax was associated with increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body weight at 150 mg/kg/day (maternal exposures approximately 1.2 times the human AUC exposure at a dose of 400 mg daily). No teratogenicity was observed in either the mouse or the rabbit. 8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of VENCLEXTA in human milk, the effects of VENCLEXTA on the breastfed child, or the effects of VENCLEXTA on milk production. Venetoclax was present in the milk when administered to lactating rats (see Data).Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from VENCLEXTA is unknown, advise nursing women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with VENCLEXTA. DataAnimal DataVenetoclax was administered (single dose; 150 mg/kg oral) to lactating rats 8 to 10 days parturition. Venetoclax in milk was 1.6 times lower than in plasma. Parent drug (venetoclax) represented the majority of the total drug-related material in milk, with trace levels of three metabolites.8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialVENCLEXTA may cause fetal harm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].Pregnancy TestingConduct pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential before initiation of VENCLEXTA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].ContraceptionAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VENCLEXTA and for at least 30 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].InfertilityBased on findings in animals, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with VENCLEXTA [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.Juvenile Animal Toxicity DataIn a juvenile toxicology study, mice were administered venetoclax at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day by oral gavage from 7 to 60 days of age. Clinical signs of toxicity included decreased activity, dehydration, skin pallor, and hunched posture at ≥30 mg/kg/day. In addition, mortality and body weight effects occurred at 100 mg/kg/day. Other venetoclax-related effects were reversible decreases in lymphocytes at ≥10 mg/kg/day; a dose of 10 mg/kg/day is approximately 0.06 times the clinical dose of 400 mg on a mg/m2 basis for a 20 kg child.8.5 Geriatric UseChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic LymphomaOf the 352 patients with previously treated CLL/SLL evaluated for safety from 3 open-label trials of VENCLEXTA monotherapy, 57% (201/352) were ≥65 years of age and 18% (62/352) were ≥75 years of age. No clinically meaningful differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between older and younger patients in the combination and monotherapy studies.Acute Myeloid LeukemiaOf the 67 patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine in the clinical trial, 96% were ≥65 years of age and 50% were ≥ 75 years of age. Of the 13 patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with decitabine in the clinical trial, 100% were ≥65 years of age and 26% were ≥ 75 years of age. Of the 61 patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine, 97% were ≥65 years of age and 66% were ≥75 years of age. The efficacy and safety data presented in the Adverse Reactions and Clinical Studies sections were obtained from these patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. There are insufficient patient numbers to show differences in safety and effectiveness between geriatric and younger patients. 8.6 Renal ImpairmentDue to the increased risk of TLS, patients with reduced renal function (CLcr <80 mL/min, calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula) require more intensive prophylaxis and monitoring to reduce the risk of TLS when initiating treatment with VENCLEXTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥ 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A recommended dose has not been determined for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) or patients on dialysis.8.7 Hepatic ImpairmentNo dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment.Reduce the dose of VENCLEXTA for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C); monitor these patients more closely for signs of toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",

        "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATIONAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).Tumor Lysis Syndrome Advise patients of the potential risk of TLS, particularly at treatment initiation and during ramp-up phase, and to immediately report any signs and symptoms associated with this event (fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, confusion, shortness of breath, seizure, irregular heartbeat, dark or cloudy urine, unusual tiredness, muscle pain, and/or joint discomfort) to their health care provider (HCP) for evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Advise patients to be adequately hydrated every day when taking VENCLEXTA to reduce the risk of TLS. The recommended volume is 6 to 8 glasses (approximately 56 ounces total) of water each day. Patients should drink water starting 2 days before and on the day of the first dose, and every time the dose is increased [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Advise patients of the importance of keeping scheduled appointments for blood work or other laboratory tests [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Advise patients that it may be necessary to take VENCLEXTA in the hospital or medical office setting to allow monitoring for TLS. Neutropenia Advise patients to contact their HCP immediately if they develop a fever or any signs of infection. Advise patients of the need for periodic monitoring of blood counts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].Infections Advise patients to contact their HCP immediately if they develop a fever or any signs of infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].Drug Interactions Advise patients to avoid consuming grapefruit products, Seville oranges, or starfruit during treatment with VENCLEXTA. Advise patients that VENCLEXTA may interact with some drugs; therefore, advise patients to inform their health care provider of the use of any prescription medication, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins and herbal products [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].Immunizations Advise patients to avoid vaccination with live vaccines because they may not be safe or effective during treatment with VENCLEXTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].Pregnancy and Lactation Advise women of the potential risk to the fetus and to avoid pregnancy during treatment with VENCLEXTA. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for at least 30 days after completing of therapy. Advise females to contact their HCP if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, during treatment with VENCLEXTA. Also advise patients not to breastfeed while taking VENCLEXTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.3)].Male Infertility Advise patients of the possibility of infertility and possible use of sperm banking for males of reproductive potential [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].Instructions for Taking VENCLEXTAAdvise patients to take VENCLEXTA exactly as prescribed and not to change their dose or to stop taking VENCLEXTA unless they are told to do so by their HCP. Advise patients to take VENCLEXTA orally once daily, at approximately the same time each day, according to their HCP's instructions and that the tablets should be swallowed whole with a meal and water without being chewed, crushed, or broken [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].Advise patients with CLL/SLL to keep VENCLEXTA in the original packaging during the first 4 weeks of treatment, and not to transfer the tablets to a different container.Advise patients that if a dose of VENCLEXTA is missed by less than 8 hours, to take the missed dose right away and take the next dose as usual. If a dose of VENCLEXTA is missed by more than 8 hours, advise patients to wait and take the next dose at the usual time [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Advise patients not to take any additional dose that day if they vomit after taking VENCLEXTA, and to take the next dose at the usual time the following day.Manufactured and Marketed by: AbbVie Inc.

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES14.1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic LymphomaCombination TherapyCLL14CLL14 (BO25323) was a randomized (1:1), multicenter, open label, actively controlled, phase 3 trial (NCT02242942) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) versus obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) for patients with previously untreated CLL with coexisting medical conditions (total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS] score > 6 or CLcr < 70 mL/min). The trial required hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin ≤2 times upper limit of normal and excluded patients with Richter’s transformation or any individual organ/system impairment score of 4 by CIRS except eye, ear, nose, and throat organ system.All patients received obinutuzumab at 1000 mg on Day 1 (the first dose could be split as 100 mg and 900 mg on Days 1 and 2), and on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, for a total of 6 cycles. Patients in the VEN+G arm began the 5-week VENCLEXTA ramp-up schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] on Day 22 of Cycle 1, and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily from Cycle 3 Day 1 until the last day of Cycle 12. Patients randomized to the GClb arm received 0.5 mg/kg oral chlorambucil on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycles 1 to 12. Each cycle was 28 days.A total of 432 patients were randomized, 216 to each study arm. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the study arms. The median age was 72 years (range: 41 to 89 years), 89% were white, 67% were male; 36% and 43% were Binet stage B and C, respectively, and 88% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <2. The median CIRS score was 8.0 (range: 0 to 28) and 58% of patients had CLcr <70 mL/min. A 17p deletion was detected in 8% of patients, TP53 mutations in 10%, 11q deletion in 19%, and unmutated IgVH in 57%.The major efficacy outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). The median duration of follow-up for PFS was 28 months (range: 0 to 36 months).Efficacy results for CLL14 are shown in Table 19. The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 1.Table 19.

Kaplan-Meier Curve of IRC-Assessed Progression-free Survival in CLL14At the time of analysis, median overall survival (OS) had not been reached, with fewer than 10% of patients experiencing an event. The median duration of follow-up for OS was 28 months.Minimal residual disease (MRD) was evaluated using allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR). The definition of negative status was less than one CLL cell per 104 leukocytes. Rates of MRD negativity 3 months after the completion of treatment regardless of response and in patients who achieved CR are shown in Table 20. At this assessment, 134 patients in the VEN+G arm who were MRD negative in peripheral blood had matched bone marrow specimens; of these, 122 patients (91%) were MRD negative in both peripheral blood and bone marrow.Table 20.

Patients in the VEN+R arm completed the 5-week ramp-up schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily for 24 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of rituximab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Rituximab was initiated intravenously after the 5-week dose ramp-up at 375 mg/m2 on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6. Each cycle was 28 days. Patients randomized to B+R received bendamustine at 70 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 2 for 6 cycles (28-day cycle) and rituximab at the above described dose and schedule. A total of 389 patients were randomized: 194 to the VEN+R arm and 195 to the B+R arm. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the VEN+R and B+R arms. The median age was 65 years (range: 22 to 85 years), 97% were white, 74% were male, and 99% had ECOG performance status <2. Median prior lines of therapy was 1 (range: 1 to 5); 59% had received 1 prior therapy, 26% had received 2 prior therapies, and 16% had received 3 or more prior therapies. Prior therapies included alkylating agents (94%), anti-CD20 antibodies (77%), B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors (2%), and prior purine analogs (81%, including fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab in 55%). A 17p deletion was detected in 24% of patients, TP53 mutations in 25%, 11q deletion in 32%, and unmutated IgVH in 63%.Efficacy was based on PFS as assessed by an IRC. The median follow-up for PFS was 23.4 months (range: 0 to 37.4+ months). Efficacy results for MURANO are shown in Table 21. The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 2.Table 21.

Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier Curve of IRC-Assessed Progression-free Survival in MURANO At the time of analysis, median overall survival had not been reached in either arm after a median follow-up of 22.9 months.At 3 months after the last dose of rituximab, the MRD negativity rate in peripheral blood in patients who achieved PR or better was 53% (103/194) in the VEN+R arm and 12% (23/195) in the B+R arm. The MRD-negative CR/CRi rate at this timepoint was 3% (6/194) in the VEN+R arm and 2% (3/195) in the B+R arm.MonotherapyThe efficacy of VENCLEXTA monotherapy in previously-treated CLL or SLL is based on three single-arm studies.Study M13-982The efficacy of VENCLEXTA was established in study M13-982 (NCT01889186), an open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial of 106 patients with CLL with 17p deletion who had received at least one prior therapy. In the study, 17p deletion was confirmed in peripheral blood specimens from patients using Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit, which is FDA approved for selection of patients for VENCLEXTA treatment. Patients received VENCLEXTA via a weekly ramp-up schedule starting at 20 mg and ramping to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and finally 400 mg once daily. Patients continued to receive 400 mg of VENCLEXTA orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy was based on overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by an IRC. Table 22 summarizes the baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the study population. Table 22.

Based on a later data cutoff date and investigator-assessed efficacy, the duration of response (DOR) ranged from 2.9 to 32.8+ months. The median DOR has not been reached with median follow-up of 22 months. Minimal residual disease was evaluated in peripheral blood and bone marrow for patients who achieved CR or CRi, following treatment with VENCLEXTA. Three percent (3/106) achieved MRD negativity in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (less than one CLL cell per 104 leukocytes). Study M12-175Study M12-175 (NCT01328626) was a multicenter, open-label trial that enrolled previously treated patients with CLL or SLL, including those with 17p deletion. Efficacy was evaluated in 67 patients (59 with CLL, 8 with SLL) who had received a 400 mg daily dose of VENCLEXTA. Patients continued this dose until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment at the time of evaluation was 22.1 months (range: 0.5 to 71.7 months).The median age was 65 years (range: 42 to 84 years), 78% were male and 87% were white. The median number of prior treatments was 3 (range: 1 to 11). At baseline, 67% of patients had one or more nodes ≥5 cm, 30% of patients had ALC ≥25 x 109/L, 33% had documented unmutated IgVH, and 21% had documented 17p deletion.Efficacy was evaluated according to 2008 IWCLL guidelines and assessed by an IRC. The ORR was 76% (95% CI: 64%, 86%), CR + CRi rate was 10%, and PR rate was 66%. The median DOR was 36.2 months (range: 2.4 to 52.4 months).Study M14-032Study M14-032 (NCT02141282) was an open-label, multicenter, study that evaluated the efficacy of VENCLEXTA in patients with CLL who had been previously treated with and progressed on or after ibrutinib or idelalisib. Patients received a daily dose of 400 mg of VENCLEXTA following the ramp-up schedule. Patients continued to receive VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At the time of analysis, the median duration of treatment was 19.5 months (range: 0.1 to 39.5 months).Of the 127 patients treated (91 with prior ibrutinib, 36 with prior idelalisib), the median age was 66 years (range: 28 to 85 years), 70% were male and 92% were white. The median number of prior treatments was 4 (range: 1 to 15). At baseline, 41% of patients had one or more nodes ≥5 cm, 31% had an absolute lymphocyte count ≥25 x 109/L, 57% had documented unmutated IgVH, and 39% had documented 17p deletion.Efficacy was based on 2008 IWCLL guidelines and was assessed by an IRC. The ORR was 70% (95% CI: 61%, 78%), with a CR + CRi rate of 5%, and PR rate of 65%. The median DOR was not reached with a median follow-up time of 19.9 months (range: 2.9 to 36 months).fig-1-venclexta-km-irc-pfs-cll-14-2019-v8fig-1-km-curve14.2 Acute Myeloid LeukemiaVENCLEXTA was studied in two open-label non-randomized trials in patients with newly-diagnosed AML who were ≥75 years of age, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity. Efficacy was established based on the rate of complete remission (CR) and the duration of CR. Study M14-358VENCLEXTA was studied in a non-randomized, open-label clinical trial (NCT02203773) of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (N=84) or decitabine (N=31) in patients with newly-diagnosed AML. Of those patients, 67 who received azacitidine combination and 13 who received decitabine combination were age 75 years or older, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy.Patients received VENCLEXTA via a daily ramp-up to a final 400 mg once daily dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. During the ramp-up, patients received TLS prophylaxis and were hospitalized for monitoring. Azacitidine at 75 mg/m2 was administered either intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1. Decitabine at 20 mg/m2 was administered intravenously on Days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients continued to receive treatment cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine dose reduction was implemented in the clinical trial for management of hematologic toxicity, see azacitidine full prescribing information. Dose reductions for decitabine were not implemented in the clinical trial. Table 24 summarizes the baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the study population.Table 24.

CR (complete remission) was defined as absolute neutrophil count >1,000/microliter, platelets >100,000/microliter, red blood cell transfusion independence, and bone marrow with <5% blasts. Absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease. CRh (complete remission with partial hematological recovery) was defined as <5% of blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets >50,000/microliter and ANC >500/microliter).The median follow-up was 7.9 months (range: 0.4 to 36 months) for VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine. At the time of analysis, for patients who achieved a CR, the median observed time in remission was 5.5 months (range: 0.4 to 30 months). The observed time in remission is the time from the start of CR to the time of data cut-off date or relapse from CR.The median follow-up was 11 months (range: 0.7 to 21 months) for VENCLEXTA in combination with decitabine. At the time of analysis, for patients who achieved a CR, the median observed time in remission was 4.7 months (range: 1.0 to 18 months). The observed time in remission is the time from the start of CR to the time of data cut-off date or relapse from CR.Median time to first CR or CRh for patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine was 1.0 month (range: 0.7 to 8.9 months). Median time to first CR or CRh for patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with decitabine was 1.9 months (range: 0.8 to 4.2 months).Of patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, 7.5% (5/67) subsequently received stem cell transplant.The study enrolled 35 additional patients (age range: 65 to 74 years) who did not have known comorbidities that preclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy and were treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (N=17) or decitabine (N=18). For the 17 patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, the CR rate was 35% (95% CI: 14%, 62%). The CRh rate was 41% (95% CI: 18%, 67%). Seven (41%) patients subsequently received stem cell transplant.For the 18 patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with decitabine, the CR rate was 56% (95% CI: 31%, 79%). The CRh rate was 22% (95% CI: 6.4%, 48%). Three (17%) patients subsequently received stem cell transplant. Study M14-387VENCLEXTA was studied in a non-randomized, open-label clinical trial (NCT02287233) of VENCLEXTA in combination with low dose cytarabine (N=82) in patients with newly-diagnosed AML, including patients with previous exposure to a hypomethylating agent for an antecedent hematologic disorder. Of those patients, 61 were age 75 years or older, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr ≥30 to <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity.Patients initiated VENCLEXTA via daily ramp-up to a final 600 mg once daily dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. During the ramp-up, patients received TLS prophylaxis and were hospitalized for monitoring. Cytarabine at a dose of 20 mg/m2 was administered subcutaneously once daily on Days 1-10 of each 28-day cycle beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1.

CRh (complete remission with partial hematological recovery) was defined as <5% of blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets >50,000/microliter and ANC >500/microliter).The median follow-up was 6.5 months (range: 0.3 to 34 months). At the time of analysis, for patients who achieved a CR, the median observed time in remission was 6.0 months (range: 0.03 to 25 months). The observed time in remission is the time from the start of CR to the time of data cut-off date or relapse from CR.Median time to first CR or CRh for patients treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine was 1.0 month (range: 0.8 to 9.4 months).The study enrolled 21 additional patients (age range: 67 to 74 years) who did not have known comorbidities that preclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy and were treated with VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine. The CR rate was 33% (95% CI: 15%, 57%). The CRh rate was 24% (95% CI: 8.2%, 47%). One patient (4.8%) subsequently received stem cell transplant.",
        "14.1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic LymphomaCombination TherapyCLL14CLL14 (BO25323) was a randomized (1:1), multicenter, open label, actively controlled, phase 3 trial (NCT02242942) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) versus obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) for patients with previously untreated CLL with coexisting medical conditions (total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS] score > 6 or CLcr < 70 mL/min). The trial required hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin ≤2 times upper limit of normal and excluded patients with Richter’s transformation or any individual organ/system impairment score of 4 by CIRS except eye, ear, nose, and throat organ system.All patients received obinutuzumab at 1000 mg on Day 1 (the first dose could be split as 100 mg and 900 mg on Days 1 and 2), and on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, for a total of 6 cycles. Patients in the VEN+G arm began the 5-week VENCLEXTA ramp-up schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] on Day 22 of Cycle 1, and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily from Cycle 3 Day 1 until the last day of Cycle 12. Patients randomized to the GClb arm received 0.5 mg/kg oral chlorambucil on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycles 1 to 12. Each cycle was 28 days.A total of 432 patients were randomized, 216 to each study arm. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the study arms. The median age was 72 years (range: 41 to 89 years), 89% were white, 67% were male; 36% and 43% were Binet stage B and C, respectively, and 88% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status <2. The median CIRS score was 8.0 (range: 0 to 28) and 58% of patients had CLcr <70 mL/min. A 17p deletion was detected in 8% of patients, TP53 mutations in 10%, 11q deletion in 19%, and unmutated IgVH in 57%.The major efficacy outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). The median duration of follow-up for PFS was 28 months (range: 0 to 36 months).Efficacy results for CLL14 are shown in Table 19. The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 1.Table 19.

The median duration of follow-up for OS was 28 months.Minimal residual disease (MRD) was evaluated using allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR). The definition of negative status was less than one CLL cell per 104 leukocytes. Rates of MRD negativity 3 months after the completion of treatment regardless of response and in patients who achieved CR are shown in Table 20. At this assessment, 134 patients in the VEN+G arm who were MRD negative in peripheral blood had matched bone marrow specimens; of these, 122 patients (91%) were MRD negative in both peripheral blood and bone marrow.Table 20.

Patients in the VEN+R arm completed the 5-week ramp-up schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily for 24 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of rituximab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Rituximab was initiated intravenously after the 5-week dose ramp-up at 375 mg/m2 on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6. Each cycle was 28 days. Patients randomized to B+R received bendamustine at 70 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 2 for 6 cycles (28-day cycle) and rituximab at the above described dose and schedule. A total of 389 patients were randomized: 194 to the VEN+R arm and 195 to the B+R arm. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the VEN+R and B+R arms. The median age was 65 years (range: 22 to 85 years), 97% were white, 74% were male, and 99% had ECOG performance status <2. Median prior lines of therapy was 1 (range: 1 to 5); 59% had received 1 prior therapy, 26% had received 2 prior therapies, and 16% had received 3 or more prior therapies. Prior therapies included alkylating agents (94%), anti-CD20 antibodies (77%), B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors (2%), and prior purine analogs (81%, including fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab in 55%). A 17p deletion was detected in 24% of patients, TP53 mutations in 25%, 11q deletion in 32%, and unmutated IgVH in 63%.Efficacy was based on PFS as assessed by an IRC. The median follow-up for PFS was 23.4 months (range: 0 to 37.4+ months). Efficacy results for MURANO are shown in Table 21. The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 2.Table 21.

Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier Curve of IRC-Assessed Progression-free Survival in MURANO At the time of analysis, median overall survival had not been reached in either arm after a median follow-up of 22.9 months.At 3 months after the last dose of rituximab, the MRD negativity rate in peripheral blood in patients who achieved PR or better was 53% (103/194) in the VEN+R arm and 12% (23/195) in the B+R arm. The MRD-negative CR/CRi rate at this timepoint was 3% (6/194) in the VEN+R arm and 2% (3/195) in the B+R arm.MonotherapyThe efficacy of VENCLEXTA monotherapy in previously-treated CLL or SLL is based on three single-arm studies.Study M13-982The efficacy of VENCLEXTA was established in study M13-982 (NCT01889186), an open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial of 106 patients with CLL with 17p deletion who had received at least one prior therapy. In the study, 17p deletion was confirmed in peripheral blood specimens from patients using Vysis CLL FISH Probe Kit, which is FDA approved for selection of patients for VENCLEXTA treatment. Patients received VENCLEXTA via a weekly ramp-up schedule starting at 20 mg and ramping to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and finally 400 mg once daily. Patients continued to receive 400 mg of VENCLEXTA orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy was based on overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by an IRC. Table 22 summarizes the baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the study population. Table 22.

Based on a later data cutoff date and investigator-assessed efficacy, the duration of response (DOR) ranged from 2.9 to 32.8+ months. The median DOR has not been reached with median follow-up of 22 months. Minimal residual disease was evaluated in peripheral blood and bone marrow for patients who achieved CR or CRi, following treatment with VENCLEXTA. Three percent (3/106) achieved MRD negativity in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (less than one CLL cell per 104 leukocytes). Study M12-175Study M12-175 (NCT01328626) was a multicenter, open-label trial that enrolled previously treated patients with CLL or SLL, including those with 17p deletion. Efficacy was evaluated in 67 patients (59 with CLL, 8 with SLL) who had received a 400 mg daily dose of VENCLEXTA. Patients continued this dose until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment at the time of evaluation was 22.1 months (range: 0.5 to 71.7 months).The median age was 65 years (range: 42 to 84 years), 78% were male and 87% were white. The median number of prior treatments was 3 (range: 1 to 11). At baseline, 67% of patients had one or more nodes ≥5 cm, 30% of patients had ALC ≥25 x 109/L, 33% had documented unmutated IgVH, and 21% had documented 17p deletion.Efficacy was evaluated according to 2008 IWCLL guidelines and assessed by an IRC. The ORR was 76% (95% CI: 64%, 86%), CR + CRi rate was 10%, and PR rate was 66%. The median DOR was 36.2 months (range: 2.4 to 52.4 months).Study M14-032Study M14-032 (NCT02141282) was an open-label, multicenter, study that evaluated the efficacy of VENCLEXTA in patients with CLL who had been previously treated with and progressed on or after ibrutinib or idelalisib. Patients received a daily dose of 400 mg of VENCLEXTA following the ramp-up schedule. Patients continued to receive VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At the time of analysis, the median duration of treatment was 19.5 months (range: 0.1 to 39.5 months).Of the 127 patients treated (91 with prior ibrutinib, 36 with prior idelalisib), the median age was 66 years (range: 28 to 85 years), 70% were male and 92% were white. The median number of prior treatments was 4 (range: 1 to 15). At baseline, 41% of patients had one or more nodes ≥5 cm, 31% had an absolute lymphocyte count ≥25 x 109/L, 57% had documented unmutated IgVH, and 39% had documented 17p deletion.Efficacy was based on 2008 IWCLL guidelines and was assessed by an IRC. The ORR was 70% (95% CI: 61%, 78%), with a CR + CRi rate of 5%, and PR rate of 65%.

        "14.2 Acute Myeloid LeukemiaVENCLEXTA was studied in two open-label non-randomized trials in patients with newly-diagnosed AML who were ≥75 years of age, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity. Efficacy was established based on the rate of complete remission (CR) and the duration of CR. Study M14-358VENCLEXTA was studied in a non-randomized, open-label clinical trial (NCT02203773) of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (N=84) or decitabine (N=31) in patients with newly-diagnosed AML. Of those patients, 67 who received azacitidine combination and 13 who received decitabine combination were age 75 years or older, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy.Patients received VENCLEXTA via a daily ramp-up to a final 400 mg once daily dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. During the ramp-up, patients received TLS prophylaxis and were hospitalized for monitoring. Azacitidine at 75 mg/m2 was administered either intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1. Decitabine at 20 mg/m2 was administered intravenously on Days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients continued to receive treatment cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Azacitidine dose reduction was implemented in the clinical trial for management of hematologic toxicity, see azacitidine full prescribing information. Dose reductions for decitabine were not implemented in the clinical trial. Table 24 summarizes the baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the study population.Table 24.

        "MEDICATION GUIDE VENCLEXTA® (ven-KLEKS-tuh) (venetoclax tablets) What is the most important information I should know about VENCLEXTA?VENCLEXTA can cause serious side effects, including:Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. TLS can cause kidney failure, the need for dialysis treatment, and may lead to death. Your healthcare provider will do tests to check your risk of getting TLS before you start taking VENCLEXTA. You will receive other medicines before starting and during treatment with VENCLEXTA to help reduce your risk of TLS. You may also need to receive intravenous (IV) fluids into your vein.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY12.1 Mechanism of ActionVenetoclax is a selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, an anti-apoptotic protein. Overexpression of BCL-2 has been demonstrated in CLL and AML cells where it mediates tumor cell survival and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics. Venetoclax helps restore the process of apoptosis by binding directly to the BCL-2 protein, displacing pro-apoptotic proteins like BIM, triggering mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the activation of caspases. In nonclinical studies, venetoclax has demonstrated cytotoxic activity in tumor cells that overexpress BCL-2. 12.2 PharmacodynamicsBased on the exposure response analyses for efficacy, a relationship between drug exposure and a greater likelihood of response was observed in clinical studies in patients with CLL/SLL, and in patients with AML. Based on the exposure response analyses for safety, a relationship between drug exposure and a greater likelihood of some safety events was observed in clinical studies in patients with AML. No exposure-safety relationship was observed in patients with CLL/SLL at doses up to 1200 mg given as monotherapy and up to 600 mg given in combination with rituximab.Cardiac ElectrophysiologyThe effect of multiple doses of VENCLEXTA up to 1200 mg once daily (2 times the maximum approved recommended dosage) on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm study in 176 patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies. VENCLEXTA had no large effect on QTc interval (i.e., > 20 ms) and there was no relationship between venetoclax exposure and change in QTc interval. 12.3 PharmacokineticsVenetoclax mean (± standard deviation) steady state Cmax was 2.1 ± 1.1 mcg/mL and AUC0-24 was32.8 ± 16.9 mcg•h/mL following administration of 400 mg once daily with a low-fat meal. Venetoclax steady state AUC increased proportionally over the dose range of 150 to 800 mg (0.25 to 1.33 times the maximum approved recommended dosage). The pharmacokinetics of venetoclax does not change over time.AbsorptionMaximum plasma concentration of venetoclax was reached 5 to 8 hours following multiple oral administration under fed conditions. Effect of FoodAdministration with a low-fat meal (approximately 512 kilocalories, 25% fat calories, 60% carbohydrate calories, and 15% protein calories) increased venetoclax exposure by approximately 3.4-fold and administration with a high-fat meal (approximately 753 kilocalories, 55% fat calories, 28% carbohydrate calories, and 17% protein calories) increased venetoclax exposure by 5.1- to 5.3-fold compared with fasting conditions. DistributionVenetoclax is highly bound to human plasma protein with unbound fraction in plasma <0.01 across a concentration range of 1-30 micromolar (0.87-26 mcg/mL). The mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.57. The apparent volume of distribution (Vdss/F) of venetoclax ranged from 256-321 L in patients. EliminationThe terminal elimination half-life of venetoclax was approximately 26 hours. MetabolismVenetoclax is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A in vitro. The major metabolite identified in plasma, M27, has an inhibitory activity against BCL-2 that is at least 58-fold lower than venetoclax in vitro and its AUC represented 80% of the parent AUC. ExcretionAfter single oral dose of radiolabeled [14C]-venetoclax 200 mg to healthy subjects, > 99.9% of the dose was recovered in feces (20.8% as unchanged) and < 0.1% in urine within 9 days. Specific PopulationsNo clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax were observed based on age (19 to 90 years), sex, race (White, Black, Asians, and Others), weight, mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min, calculated by Cockcroft-Gault), or mild to moderate hepatic impairment (normal total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase (AST) > upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin 1 to 3 times ULN). The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) or dialysis on venetoclax pharmacokinetics is unknown. Patients with Hepatic ImpairmentFollowing a single dose of VENCLEXTA 50 mg, venetoclax systemic exposure (AUCinf) was 2.7-fold higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. No clinically relevant differences in venetoclax systemic exposure were observed between subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function.Drug Interactions StudiesClinical StudiesNo clinically significant differences in venetoclax pharmacokinetics were observed when co-administered with azacitidine, azithromycin, cytarabine, decitabine, gastric acid reducing agents, obinutuzumab, or rituximab.KetoconazoleConcomitant use of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) 400 mg once daily for 7 days increased venetoclax Cmax by 130% and AUCinf by 540% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].RitonavirConcomitant use of ritonavir (a strong CYP3A, P-gp and OATP1B1/B3 inhibitor) 50 mg once daily for 14 days increased venetoclax Cmax by 140% and AUC by 690% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].Posaconazole Concomitant use of posaconazole (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor) 300 mg with venetoclax 50 mg and 100 mg for 7 days resulted in 61% and 86% higher venetoclax Cmax, respectively, compared with venetoclax 400 mg administered alone. The venetoclax AUC24 was 90% and 144% higher, respectively.RifampinConcomitant use of a single dose of rifampin(an OATP1B1/1B3 and P-gp inhibitor) 600 mg increased venetoclax Cmax by 106% and AUCinf by 78%. Concomitant use of multiple doses of rifampin (as a strong CYP3A inducer) 600 mg once daily for 13 days decreased venetoclax Cmax by 42% and AUCinf by 71% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. WarfarinConcomitant use of a single 400 mg dose of venetoclax with 5 mg warfarin resulted in 18% to 28% increase in Cmax and AUCinf of R-warfarin and S-warfarin [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].DigoxinConcomitant use of a single dose of venetoclax 100 mg with digoxin (a P-gp substrate) 0.5 mg increased digoxin Cmax by 35% and AUCinf by 9% [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].In Vitro StudiesVenetoclax is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4. Venetoclax is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and UGT1A1.Venetoclax is not an inhibitor of UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. Venetoclax is an inhibitor and substrate of P-gp and BCRP and weak inhibitor of OATP1B1. Venetoclax is not an inhibitor of OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, or MATE2K."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityNeither venetoclax nor M27, a major human metabolite, were carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse study at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day of venetoclax, and at a single oral dose level of 250 mg/kg/day of M27.Venetoclax was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay, did not induce numerical or structural aberrations in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and was not clastogenic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay at doses up to 835 mg/kg. The M27 metabolite was negative for genotoxic activity in in vitro Ames and chromosome aberration assays.Fertility and early embryonic development studies were conducted in male and female mice. These studies evaluate mating, fertilization, and embryonic development through implantation. There were no effects of venetoclax on estrous cycles, mating, fertility, corpora lutea, uterine implants or live embryos per litter at dosages up to 600 mg/kg/day. However, a risk to human male fertility exists based on testicular toxicity (germ cell loss) observed in dogs at exposures as low as 0.5 times the human AUC exposure at a dose of 400 mg."

        "10 OVERDOSAGEThere is no specific antidote for VENCLEXTA. For patients who experience overdose, closely monitor and provide appropriate supportive treatment; during ramp-up phase interrupt VENCLEXTA and monitor carefully for signs and symptoms of TLS along with other toxicities [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Based on venetoclax large volume of distribution and extensive protein binding, dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of venetoclax."
