        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage of Beleodaq is 1,000 mg/m 2 administered over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion once daily on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle. Cycles can be repeated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ( 2.1 ) Treatment discontinuation or interruption with or without dosage reductions by 25% may be needed to manage adverse reactions ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dosage of Beleodaq is 1,000 mg/m 2 administered over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion once daily on Days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle. Cycles can be repeated every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.2 Dosage Modification for Hematologic and Non-Hematologic Toxicities Table 1 displays the recommended Beleodaq dosage modifications for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. Base dosage adjustments for thrombocytopenia and neutropenia on platelet and absolute neutrophil nadir (lowest value) counts in the preceding cycle of therapy. • Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be greater than or equal to 1.0 x 10 9 /L and the platelet count should be greater than or equal to 50 x 10 9 /L prior to the start of each cycle and prior to resuming treatment following toxicity. Resume subsequent treatment with Beleodaq according to the guidelines described in Table 1 below. Discontinue Beleodaq in patients who have recurrent ANC nadirs less than 0.5 x 10 9 /L and/or recurrent platelet count nadirs less than 25 x 10 9 /L after two dosage reductions. • Other toxicities must be NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 or less prior to re-treatment. Monitor complete blood counts at baseline and weekly. Perform serum chemistry tests, including renal and hepatic functions prior to the start of the first dose of each cycle.

Swirl the contents of the vial until there are no visible particles in the resulting solution. The reconstituted product may be stored for up to 12 hours at ambient temperature (15-25°C; 59-77°F). b) Aseptically withdraw the volume needed for the required dosage (based on the 50 mg/mL concentration and the patient’s BSA [m 2 ]) and transfer to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9 % Sodium Chloride injection. The infusion bag with drug solution may be stored at ambient room temperature (15-25°C; 59-77°F) for up to 36 hours including infusion time. c) Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter. Do not use if cloudiness or particulates are observed. d) Connect the infusion bag containing drug solution to an infusion set with a 0.22 µm in-line filter for administration. e) Infuse intravenously over 30 minutes.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of belinostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Beleodaq, and for 2 weeks after the last dose 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Beleodaq. Contraception Females Beleodaq can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Beleodaq and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Beleodaq and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Males Based on findings from animal studies, Beleodaq may impair male fertility. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Beleodaq in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Belinostat is metabolized in the liver and hepatic impairment is expected to increase exposure to belinostat.

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Beleodaq is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones and some non-histone proteins. In vitro , belinostat caused the accumulation of acetylated histones and other proteins, inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. Belinostat shows preferential cytotoxicity towards tumor cells compared to normal cells. Belinostat inhibited the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases at nanomolar concentrations (<250 nM). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology Multiple clinical trials have been conducted with Beleodaq, in many of which ECG data were collected and analyzed by a central laboratory. Analysis of clinical ECG and belinostat plasma concentration data demonstrated no meaningful effect of Beleodaq on cardiac repolarization. None of the trials showed any clinically relevant changes caused by Beleodaq on heart rate, PR duration or QRS duration as measures of autonomic state, atrio-ventricular conduction or depolarization; there were no cases of Torsades de Pointes. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic characteristics of belinostat were analyzed from pooled data from phase 1/2 clinical studies that used doses of belinostat ranging from 150 to 1200 mg/m 2 . The total mean plasma clearance and elimination half-life were 1240 mL/min and 1.1 hours, respectively. The total clearance approximates average hepatic blood flow (1500 mL/min), suggesting high hepatic extraction (clearance being flow dependent). Distribution The mean belinostat volume of distribution approaches total body water, indicating that belinostat has limited body tissue distribution. In vitro plasma studies have shown that between 92.9% and 95.8% of belinostat is bound to protein in an equilibrium dialysis assay, and was independent of belinostat plasma concentrations from 500 to 25,000 ng/mL. Elimination Metabolism Belinostat is primarily metabolized by hepatic UGT1A1. Strong UGT1A1 inhibitors are expected to increase exposure to belinostat. Belinostat also undergoes hepatic metabolism by CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 enzymes to form belinostat amide and belinostat acid. The enzymes responsible for the formation of methyl belinostat and 3-(anilinosulfonyl)-benzenecarboxylic acid, (3-ASBA) are not known. Excretion Following a single dose of [ 14 C]-labelled belinostat (100 μCi, 1500 mg) administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion in patients with recurrent or progressive malignancy (N=6), fecal excretion accounted for a mean (± SD) of 9.7% (± 6.5%) of the administered radioactive belinostat dose over 168 hours. The mean (± SD) of the administered radioactive belinostat dose that was excreted in urine over 168 hours was 84.8% (± 9.8%), of which unchanged belinostat accounted for only 1.7%. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies showed belinostat and its metabolites (including belinostat glucuronide, belinostat amide, methyl belinostat) inhibited metabolic activities of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. Other metabolites (3-ASBA and belinostat acid) inhibited CYP2C8. In cancer patients, co-administration of Beleodaq (1,000 mg/m 2 ) and warfarin (5 mg), a known CYP2C9 substrate, did not increase the AUC or C max of either R- or S-warfarin. Belinostat is likely a glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is unlikely to inhibit P-gp. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics UGT1A1 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity such as the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. Approximately 20% of the black population, 10% of the white population, and 2% of the Asian population are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. Additional reduced function alleles may be more prevalent in specific populations. Because belinostat is primarily (80 -90%) metabolized by UGT1A1, the clearance of belinostat could be decreased in patients with reduced UGT1A1 activity (e.g., patients with UGT1A1*28 allele). Reduce the starting dose of Beleodaq to 750 mg/m 2 in patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele to minimize dose limiting toxicities.",

There were 120 patients who had histologically confirmed PTCL by central review evaluable for efficacy. Patients were treated with repeat cycles every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy was evaluated using response rate (complete response and partial response) as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) using the International Workshop Criteria (IWC) (Cheson 2007). Response assessments were evaluated every 6 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks until 2 years from the start of study treatment. Duration of response was measured from the first day of documented response to disease progression or death. Response and progression of disease were evaluated by the IRC using the IWC. Table 3 summarizes the baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the study population, who were evaluable for efficacy.

Of the responders, the median time to response was 5.6 weeks (range 4.3 - 50.4 weeks). Nine patients (7.5%) were able to proceed to a stem cell transplant after treatment with Beleodaq."
