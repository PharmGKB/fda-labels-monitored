        "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE JEMPERLI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced: • endometrial cancer (EC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen, or • solid tumors, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that have progressed on or following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). JEMPERLI is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)–blocking antibody indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced: • endometrial cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen, or • solid tumors, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that have progressed on or following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Dose 1 through 4: 500 mg every 3 weeks. ( 2.2 ) • Subsequent dosing beginning 3 weeks after Dose 4 (Dose 5 onwards): 1,000 mg every 6 weeks. ( 2.2 ) • Administer as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Mismatch Repair Deficient Recurrent or Advanced Endometrial Cancer or Mismatch Repair Deficient Recurrent or Advanced Solid Tumors Select patients for treatment with JEMPERLI based on the presence of dMMR in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of dMMR status is available at https://www.fda.gov/companiondiagnostics. Because the effect of prior chemotherapy on test results for dMMR in patients with high-grade gliomas is unclear, it is recommended to test for this marker in the primary tumor specimen obtained prior to initiation of temozolomide chemotherapy in patients with high-grade gliomas. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of JEMPERLI is: • Dose 1 through Dose 4: 500 mg every 3 weeks • Subsequent dosing beginning 3 weeks after Dose 4 (Dose 5 onwards): 1,000 mg every 6 weeks Administer JEMPERLI as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Treat patients until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions No dose reductions of JEMPERLI are recommended. In general, withhold JEMPERLI for severe (Grade 3) immune‑mediated adverse reactions. Permanently discontinue JEMPERLI for life‑threatening (Grade 4) immune‑mediated adverse reactions, recurrent severe (Grade 3) immune-mediated reactions that require systemic immunosuppressive treatment, or an inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg or less of prednisone equivalent per day within 12 weeks of initiating steroids. Dosage modifications for JEMPERLI for adverse reactions that require management different from these general guidelines are summarized in Table 1 . Table 1. Recommended Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions AST = aspartate aminotransferase, ALT = alanine aminotransferase, ULN = upper limit of normal, SJS = Stevens-Johnson syndrome, TEN = toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS = drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. a Based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0. b Resume in patients with complete or partial resolution (Grade 0 to 1) after corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue if no complete or partial resolution within 12 weeks of initiating steroids or inability to reduce prednisone to less than 10 mg/day (or equivalent) within 12 weeks of initiating steroids. c If AST and ALT are less than or equal to ULN at baseline in patients with liver involvement, withhold or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI based on recommendations for hepatitis with no liver involvement.

The solution is clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to yellow. Discard the vial if visible particles are observed. • Do not shake. • For the 500-mg dose, withdraw 10 mL of JEMPERLI from a vial using a disposable sterile syringe made of polypropylene and dilute into an intravenous infusion bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to a final concentration between 2 to 10 mg/mL (maximum 250 mL). JEMPERLI is compatible with an infusion bag made of polyolefin, ethylene vinyl acetate, or polyvinyl chloride with di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). • For the 1,000-mg dose, withdraw 10 mL from each of 2 vials (withdraw 20 mL total) and dilute into an intravenous bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to a final concentration between 4 to 10 mg/mL (maximum 250 mL). • Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion. Do not shake. • Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Storage of Infusion Solution Store in the original carton until time of preparation in order to protect from light. The prepared dose may be stored either: • At room temperature for no more than 6 hours from the time of preparation until the end of infusion. • Under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36ºF to 46ºF) for no more than 24 hours from time of preparation until end of infusion. If refrigerated, allow the diluted solution to come to room temperature prior to administration. Discard after 6 hours at room temperature or after 24 hours under refrigeration. Do not freeze. Administration Administer infusion solution intravenously over 30 minutes through an intravenous line using tubing made of polyvinyl chloride or platinum cured silicon; fittings made of polyvinyl chloride or polycarbonate; and a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low‑protein binding, 0.2-micron, in-line or add-on filter. JEMPERLI must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. Do not co‑administer other drugs through the same infusion line."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune‑mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune‑mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction, immune‑mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, and solid organ transplant rejection. Monitor for signs and symptoms of immune‑mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries, including liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function, at baseline and periodically during treatment. Withhold or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI and administer corticosteroids based on the severity of reaction. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) • Infusion-related reactions: Interrupt, slow the rate of infusion, or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI based on severity of reaction. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) • Complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD‑1/PD-L1–blocking antibody. ( 5.3 ) • Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions JEMPERLI is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance, and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS may not include all possible severe and fatal immune‑mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which can be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune‑mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting a PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibodies, they can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibodies. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD‑1/PD‑L1–blocking antibodies. Monitor closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function tests at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . In general, if JEMPERLI requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reaction is not controlled with corticosteroids. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies, dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis JEMPERLI can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which can be fatal. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.4% (7/515) of patients receiving JEMPERLI, including Grade 2 (1.2%) and Grade 3 (0.2%) pneumonitis. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of JEMPERLI in 0.6% patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 86% of the 7 patients. Two patients reinitiated JEMPERLI after symptom improvement; of these, 1 patient had recurrence of pneumonitis. Immune-Mediated Colitis JEMPERLI can cause immune-mediated colitis. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation have occurred in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis treated with PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibodies. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.4% (7/515) of patients receiving JEMPERLI, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and Grade 3 (0.6%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to discontinuation of JEMPERLI in 1 (0.2%) patient. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 29% (2/7) of patients with colitis. Colitis resolved in 71% of the 7 patients. Of the 3 patients in whom JEMPERLI was withheld for colitis, all reinitiated treatment with JEMPERLI. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis JEMPERLI can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, which can be fatal. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.2% (1/515) of patients receiving JEMPERLI, which was Grade 3. Systemic corticosteroids were required and the event resolved. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency: JEMPERLI can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment per institutional guidelines, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1.4% (7/515) patients receiving JEMPERLI, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and Grade 3 (0.6%). Adrenal insufficiency resulted in discontinuation in 1 (0.2%) patient and resolved in 29% of the 7 patients. Hypophysitis: JEMPERLI can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field cuts. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Thyroid Disorders: JEMPERLI can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement or medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Thyroiditis: Thyroiditis occurred in 0.4% (2/515) of patients receiving JEMPERLI; both were Grade 2. Neither event of thyroiditis resolved; there were no discontinuations of JEMPERLI due to thyroiditis. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism occurred in 7.2% (37/515) of patients receiving JEMPERLI, all of which were Grade 2. Hypothyroidism did not lead to discontinuation of JEMPERLI and resolved in 35% of the 37 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were not required for any of the 37 patients with hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism: Hyperthyroidism occurred in 1.9% (10/515) of patients receiving JEMPERLI, including Grade 2 (1.7%) and Grade 3 (0.2%). Hyperthyroidism did not lead to discontinuation of JEMPERLI and resolved in 80% of the 10 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were not required for any of the 10 patients with hyperthyroidism. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Which Can Present with Diabetic Ketoacidosis: JEMPERLI can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction JEMPERLI can cause immune-mediated nephritis, which can be fatal. Nephritis occurred in 0.4% (2/515) of patients receiving JEMPERLI; both were Grade 2. Nephritis did not lead to discontinuation of JEMPERLI and resolved in both patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 1 of the 2 patients experiencing nephritis. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions JEMPERLI can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with PD‑1/PD‑L1–blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-bullous/exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in <1% of the 515 patients treated with JEMPERLI or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, Guillain‑Barre syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis. Ocular: Uveitis, iritis, other ocular inflammatory toxicities. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment to include blindness can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune‑mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt‑Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica. Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism. Other (Hematologic/Immune): Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenia, solid organ transplant rejection. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions Severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions have been reported with PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibodies. Severe infusion-related reactions (Grade 3) occurred in 0.2% (1/515) of patients receiving JEMPERLI. All patients recovered from the infusion-related reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion or permanently discontinue JEMPERLI based on severity of reaction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1–blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, JEMPERLI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus, resulting in fetal death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with JEMPERLI and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] • Infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients with dMMR solid tumors are fatigue/asthenia, anemia, diarrhea, and nausea. Most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥2%) are decreased lymphocytes, decreased sodium, increased alkaline phosphatase, and decreased albumin. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to JEMPERLI as a single-agent in 515 patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors in the non-randomized, open-label, multicohort GARNET trial that enrolled 290 patients with endometrial cancer and 225 patients with other solid tumors. JEMPERLI was administered intravenously at doses of 500 mg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by 1,000 mg every 6 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among the 515 patients, 42% were exposed for > 24 weeks and 26% were exposed for >48 weeks. Mismatch Repair Deficient (dMMR) Endometrial Cancer The safety of JEMPERLI was evaluated in GARNET in 104 patients with advanced or recurrent dMMR EC who received at least 1 dose of JEMPERLI [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Patients received JEMPERLI 500 mg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by 1,000 mg every 6 weeks as an intravenous infusion until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Among patients receiving JEMPERLI, 47% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 20% were exposed for >1 year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients receiving JEMPERLI. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included sepsis (2.9%), acute kidney injury (2.9%), urinary tract infection (2.9%), abdominal pain (2.9%), and pyrexia (2.9%). JEMPERLI was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5 (4.8%) patients, including increased transaminases, sepsis, bronchitis, and pneumonitis. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 23% of patients who received JEMPERLI. Adverse reactions that required dosage interruption in ≥1% of patients who received JEMPERLI were anemia, diarrhea, increased lipase, and pyrexia. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue/asthenia, nausea, diarrhea, anemia, and constipation. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥2%) were anemia and increased transaminases. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥2%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased sodium, decreased leukocytes, decreased albumin, increased creatinine, increased alkaline phosphatase and increased alanine aminotransferase. Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥10% of patients with dMMR EC on JEMPERLI in GARNET. Table 2.

Patients received JEMPERLI 500 mg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by 1,000 mg every 6 weeks as an intravenous infusion until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to JEMPERLI was 25 weeks (range: 1 to 139 weeks). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients receiving JEMPERLI. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included abdominal pain (3.7%), sepsis (2.6%), and acute kidney injury (2.2%). Fatal adverse reaction occurred in 1 patient who received JEMPERLI due to respiratory failure. JEMPERLI was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% patients; the most common adverse reaction ( > 1%) leading to discontinuation was increased alanine aminotransferase (1.1%). Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 23% of patients who received JEMPERLI. Adverse reactions that required dosage interruption in ≥1% of patients who received JEMPERLI were anemia, pneumonitis, diarrhea, adrenal insufficiency, increased alanine aminotransferase, and increased aspartate aminotransferase. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue/asthenia, anemia, diarrhea, and nausea. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥2%) were anemia, fatigue/asthenia, increased transaminases, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥2%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased sodium, increased alkaline phosphatase, and decreased albumin.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to dostarlimab-gxly in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. The immunogenicity of dostarlimab was evaluated in GARNET. Treatment‑emergent anti‑drug antibodies (ADAs) against dostarlimab-gxly were detected in 2.1% of 384 patients who received dostarlimab-gxly at the recommended dosage. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 1% of patients. Because of the small number of patients who developed ADAs, the effect of immunogenicity on the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab-gxly is inconclusive."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, JEMPERLI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no available data on the use of JEMPERLI in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death (see Data). Human IgG4 immunoglobulins (IgG4) are known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, dostarlimab-gxly has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with JEMPERLI to evaluate its effect on reproduction and fetal development. A central function of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. In murine models of pregnancy, blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore, potential risks of administering JEMPERLI during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related to the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 and PD-L1 knockout mice. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to dostarlimab-gxly may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of dostarlimab-gxly in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of JEMPERLI. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential JEMPERLI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating JEMPERLI [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Contraception Females: Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with JEMPERLI and for 4 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of JEMPERLI have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 515 patients treated with JEMPERLI, 51% were younger than 65 years, 37% were aged 65 through 75 years, and 12% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors, and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Dostarlimab-gxly is a humanized monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 isotype that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for safety and effectiveness of dostarlimab-gxly have not been fully characterized. Dostarlimab-gxly provides sustained target engagement as measured by direct PD-1 binding and stimulation of IL-2 production throughout the dosing interval at the recommended dose. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of dostarlimab-gxly were evaluated in patients with various solid tumors, including 288 patients with EC. Mean C max , AUC 0-inf , and AUC 0-tau increased proportionally over the dose range of 1 to 10 mg/kg. The Cycle 1 mean (coefficient of variation [%CV]) C max and AUC 0-tau of dostarlimab-gxly were 171 mcg/mL (20%) and 35,730 mcg*h/mL (20%) at the dosage of 500 mg once every 3 weeks and 309 mcg/mL (31%) and 95,820 mcg*h/mL (29%) at the dosage of 1,000 mg every 6 weeks, respectively. Distribution The mean (%CV) volume of distribution of dostarlimab-gxly at steady state is approximately 5.3 L (14%). Elimination The mean terminal elimination half-life of dostarlimab-gxly at steady state is 23.5 days and its mean (%CV) clearance is 0.007 L/h (30%) at steady state. Metabolism: Dostarlimab-gxly is expected to be metabolized into small peptides and amino acids by catabolic pathways. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of dostarlimab-gxly were observed based on age (24 to 86 years), sex, race/ethnicity (75% White, 2% Asian, and 4% African American), tumor type, and renal impairment based on the estimated creatinine clearance and mild [total bilirubin (TB) > ULN to 1.5 times ULN or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN] to moderate (TB > 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment."

The efficacy population consisted of a cohort of 71 patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced EC who had progressed on or after treatment with a platinum‑containing regimen. Patients with prior treatment with PD‑1/PD‑L1–blocking antibodies or other immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy with immunosuppressant agents within 2 years were excluded from the trial. Patients received JEMPERLI 500 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by 1,000 mg intravenously every 6 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Response (DOR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1. The baseline characteristics were: median age 64 years (49% aged 65 years or older); 82% White, 3% Asian, 1% Black; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 (32%) or 1 (68%). At time of trial entry, 66% of the patients with dMMR EC had International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage IV disease. The most common histology seen was endometrioid carcinoma type 1 (70%), followed by serous (6%) and mixed and undifferentiated (2.8% each). All patients with dMMR EC had received prior anticancer treatment, with 90% of patients receiving prior anticancer surgery and 79% receiving prior anticancer radiotherapy. Approximately 40% had 2 lines or more of prior anticancer treatment. Approximately 11% of patients had received 3 regimens and 4% had received 4 or more prior regimens. The dMMR tumor status was retrospectively confirmed using the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel assay. Efficacy results are presented in Table 6 . Table 6.

The efficacy population consisted of a cohort of 209 patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced solid tumors who progressed following systemic therapy and had no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Patients with dMMR endometrial cancer must have progressed on or after treatment with a platinum-containing regimen. Patients with dMMR colorectal cancer must have progressed after or been intolerant to a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Patients with prior treatment with PD‑1/PD‑L1–blocking antibodies or other immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy with immunosuppressant agents within 2 years were excluded from the trial. Patients received JEMPERLI 500 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by 1,000 mg intravenously every 6 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DOR as determined by a BICR according to RECIST v 1.1. The baseline characteristics were female (77%); median age 63 years (47% aged 65 years or older); 63% White, 3% Asian, 2% Black; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 (39%) or 1 (61%). At time of trial entry, 97.2% of patients (103/106) with non-endometrial dMMR solid tumors had Stage IV disease, and 68.0% (70/103) of patients with dMMR endometrial tumors had FIGO Stage IV disease. Approximately 43% of patients had received 1 prior line of systemic anticancer treatment, 36% had received 2 prior lines, and 21% had received 3 or more prior lines.
