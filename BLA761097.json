        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions ( 5.1 ) Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction, and solid organ transplant rejection. Monitor for early identification and management. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. Withhold or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO based on the severity of reaction. ( 2.3 ) Infusion-Related Reactions: Interrupt, slow the rate of infusion, or permanently discontinue based on severity of reaction. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT): Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions LIBTAYO is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. The incidence and severity of immune-mediated adverse reactions were similar when LIBTAYO was administered as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Immune-mediated adverse reactions affecting more than one body system can occur simultaneously. Early identification and management of immune‐mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In general, if LIBTAYO requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroids. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis LIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The definition of immune-mediated pneumonitis included the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate etiology. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% (33/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.6%), and Grade 2 (1.6%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 1.3% of patients and withholding of LIBTAYO in 1.4% of the patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 61% of the 33 patients. Of the 18 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for pneumonitis, 10 reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these, 4/10 (40%) had recurrence of pneumonitis. Immune-Mediated Colitis LIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated colitis. The definition of immune-mediated colitis included the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate etiology. The primary component of the immune-mediated colitis was diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2% (25/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 3 (0.8%) and Grade 2 (0.9%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 0.4% of patients and withholding of LIBTAYO in 1.2% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with colitis. Colitis resolved in 56% of the 25 patients. Of the 16 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for colitis, 6 reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these, 4/6 (67%) had recurrence of colitis. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis LIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. The definition of immune-mediated hepatitis included the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate etiology. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 2.4% (31/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including fatal (< 0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (1.6%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 1.4% of patients and withholding of LIBTAYO in 0.7% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with hepatitis. Thirteen percent (13%) of these patients (4/31) required additional immunosuppression with mycophenolate. Hepatitis resolved in 39% of the 31 patients. Of the 9 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for hepatitis, 5 patients reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these, 1/5 (20%) had recurrence of hepatitis. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency LIBTAYO can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold LIBTAYO depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.5% (6/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 3 (0.5%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. LIBTAYO was withheld in 1 (< 0.1%) patient due to adrenal insufficiency and not reinitiated. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 83% (5/6) patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 17% of the 6 patients. Hypophysitis LIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.5% (7/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 1 (< 0.1%) patient and withholding of LIBTAYO in 2 (0.2%) patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 86% (6/7) patients with hypophysitis. Hypophysitis resolved in 14% of the 7 patients. Of the 2 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for hypophysitis, none of the patients reinitiated. Thyroid Disorders LIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement or medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Thyroiditis: Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (8/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. No patient discontinued LIBTAYO due to thyroiditis. Thyroiditis led to withholding of LIBTAYO in 1 (< 0.1%) patient. Systemic corticosteroids were not required in any patient with thyroiditis. Thyroiditis resolved in 13% of the 8 patients. Blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased and blood thyroid stimulating hormone decreased have also been reported. Hyperthyroidism: Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3% (39/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 3 (< 0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.9%) adverse reactions. No patient discontinued treatment due to hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism led to withholding of LIBTAYO in 7 (0.5%) patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 8% (3/39) of patients with hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 56% of the 39 patients. Of the 7 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for hyperthyroidism, 2 patients reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence of hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism occurred in 7% (87/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 3 (< 0.1%) and Grade 2 (6%) adverse reactions . Hypothyroidism led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 3 (0.2%) patients. Hypothyroidism led to withholding of LIBTAYO in 9 (0.7%) patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 1.1% (1/87) of patients. Hypothyroidism resolved in 6% of the 87 patients. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. Of the 9 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for hypothyroidism, 1 reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement and did not have recurrence of hypothyroidism. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold LIBTAYO depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in < 0.1% (1/1281) of patients (Grade 4). No patient discontinued treatment due to Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes mellitus led to withholding of LIBTAYO in 0.1% of patients, treatment was reinitiated after symptom improvement. Patient received long-term insulin therapy. Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction LIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated nephritis. The definition of immune-mediated nephritis included the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate etiology. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.7% (9/1281) patients receiving LIBTAYO, including fatal (< 0.1%), Grade 3 (< 0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.5%) adverse reactions. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 0.2% of patients and withholding of LIBTAYO in 0.4% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with nephritis. Nephritis resolved in 78% of the 9 patients. Of the 5 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for nephritis, 4 reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these, 1/4 (25%) had recurrence of nephritis. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions LIBTAYO can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. The definition of immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reaction included the required use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants and the absence of a clear alternate etiology. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms), has occurred with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.9% (24/1281) of patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 3 (0.9%) and Grade 2 (0.8%) adverse reactions. Dermatologic adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 0.2% of patients and withholding of LIBTAYO in 1.3% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions resolved in 71% of the 24 patients. Of the 17 patients in whom LIBTAYO was withheld for dermatologic adverse reaction, 13 reinitiated LIBTAYO after symptom improvement; of these 5/13 (38%) had recurrence of the dermatologic adverse reaction. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of < 1% in 1281 patients who received LIBTAYO or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies . Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barre syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy Ocular: Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment to include blindness can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis, stomatitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis/dermatomyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism Other (Hematologic/Immune): Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenia, solid organ transplant rejection. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions Severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions occurred in 0.2% of patients receiving LIBTAYO as a single agent. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Common symptoms of infusion-related reaction include nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO based on severity of reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, LIBTAYO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LIBTAYO and for at least 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling. Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Infusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Complications of Allogeneic HSCT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] LIBTAYO as a Single Agent : The most common adverse reactions (≥15%) are fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, diarrhea, and anemia. ( 6.1 ) LIBTAYO in Combination with Platinum-based Chemotherapy The most common adverse reactions (≥15%) are alopecia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and decreased appetite. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Regeneron at 1-877-542-8296 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described in Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to LIBTAYO as a single agent in 1281 patients in three open-label, single-arm, multicohort studies, and two open-label randomized multi-center studies. These studies included 384 patients with advanced CSCC (Studies 1540 and 1423), 138 patients with advanced BCC (Study 1620), 355 patients with NSCLC (Study 1624), and 404 patients with other advanced solid tumors. LIBTAYO was administered intravenously at doses of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=235), 350 mg every 3 weeks (n=1014), or other doses (n=32). Among the 1281 patients, 53% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 26% were exposed for one year or longer. In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions (≥15%) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, diarrhea, and anemia. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (≥2%) were lymphopenia, anemia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and increased alanine aminotransferase. In addition, the data below reflect exposure to LIBTAYO in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in 312 patients with NSCLC enrolled in a randomized, active controlled trial (Study 16113). Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC) Study 1540 The safety of LIBTAYO was evaluated in 358 patients with advanced CSCC (metastatic or locally advanced disease) in Study 1540 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Of these 358 patients, 213 had mCSCC (nodal or distant) and 145 had laCSCC. Patients received LIBTAYO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=137) or 350 mg every 3 weeks (n=221) as an intravenous infusion until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of planned treatment. The median duration of exposure was 40 weeks (1 week to 109 weeks). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia (3.6%), skin infection (3.6%), and pneumonitis (2.8%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients who received LIBTAYO, including deaths due to infections (2.2%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 12% of patients. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation in at least 2 patients were pneumonitis, rash, confusional state, general physical health deterioration, hemorrhage, liver function test abnormalities, and musculoskeletal pain. Dosage interruptions of LIBTAYO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 36% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in ≥ 2% of patients included diarrhea, infusion-related reaction, upper respiratory tract infection, liver function test abnormalities, musculoskeletal pain, pneumonitis, and rash. The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, rash, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, pruritis, and nausea. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥ 2%) were hypertension, skin infection, pneumonia, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and pneumonitis. The most common (≥ 4%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities worsening from baseline were lymphopenia, hyponatremia, anemia, and hypophosphatemia.

( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, LIBTAYO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no available data on the use of LIBTAYO in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death (see Data ) . Human IgG4 immunoglobulins (IgG4) are known to cross the placenta; therefore, LIBTAYO has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with LIBTAYO to evaluate its effect on reproduction and fetal development. A central function of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. In murine models of pregnancy, blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore, potential risks of administering LIBTAYO during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related to the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 and PD-L1 knockout mice. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to cemiplimab-rwlc may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of cemiplimab-rwlc in human milk, or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of LIBTAYO. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LIBTAYO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception LIBTAYO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LIBTAYO and for at least 4 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LIBTAYO have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use LIBTAYO as a Single Agent Of the 1281 patients who received LIBTAYO as a single agent in clinical studies, 26% were 65 years up to 75 years and 22% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. Of the 358 patients with mCSCC or laCSCC who received LIBTAYO as a single agent in Study 1540, 30% were 65 years up to 75 years and 48% were 75 years or older.

        "11 DESCRIPTION Cemiplimab-rwlc is a human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody. Cemiplimab-rwlc is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. Cemiplimab-rwlc is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell suspension culture. Cemiplimab-rwlc has an approximate molecular weight of 146 kDa. LIBTAYO (cemiplimab-rwlc) injection for intravenous use is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution with a pH of 6. The solution may contain trace amounts of translucent to white particles. Each vial contains 350 mg of cemiplimab-rwlc. Each mL contains cemiplimab-rwlc 50 mg, L-histidine (0.74 mg), L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate (1.1 mg), sucrose (50 mg), L-proline (15 mg), Polysorbate 80 (2 mg), and Water for Injection, USP."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Binding of the PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Cemiplimab-rwlc is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cemiplimab exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response are not fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Cemiplimab-rwlc pharmacokinetic data were collected in 1063 patients with various solid tumors. The pharmacokinetics of cemiplimab-rwlc were linear and dose proportional in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg LIBTAYO administered intravenously every 2 weeks. At 350 mg every 3 weeks, the mean cemiplimab-rwlc concentrations (coefficient of variation, CV%) at steady-state ranged between a minimum concentration of 59 mg/L (47%) and a maximum concentration of 171 mg/L (27%). Steady-state exposure is achieved after 4 months of treatment. In patients with CSCC, cemiplimab-rwlc steady-state exposure at 350 mg every 3 weeks was comparable to the exposure at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Distribution The volume of distribution of cemiplimab-rwlc at steady state is 5.9 L (29%). Elimination Cemiplimab-rwlc clearance (CV%) after the first dose is 0.25 L/day (41%) and decreases over time by 11%, resulting in a steady-state clearance (CL ss ) (CV%) of 0.22 L/day (44%). The elimination half-life (CV%) at steady state is 22 days (42%). Specific Populations The following factors have no clinically important effect on the exposure of cemiplimab-rwlc in 1063 patients: age (27 to 96 years), sex, body weight (31 to 172 kg), cancer type, albumin level (20 to 93 g/L), renal function (creatinine clearance determined by Cockcroft-Gault 21 mL/min or greater) and hepatic function (total bilirubin greater than 1.0 times up to 3.0 times the ULN). Race [White (N=932), Asian (N=47), Black (N=21)] appears to have no clinically important effect on the exposure of cemiplimab-rwlc. LIBTAYO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin greater than 3.0 times the ULN). 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of cemiplimab-rwlc or of other cemiplimab products. During the treatment period ranging from 8 to 19 months in 5 clinical studies, the incidence of anti-cemiplimab-rwlc antibodies in LIBTAYO-treated patients was 2% (22/1029). There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-cemiplimab-rwlc antibodies on PK of LIBTAYO over the treatment duration ranging from 8 months to 19 months. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of LIBTAYO is unknown."

Both studies excluded patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy with immunosuppressant agents within 5 years; history of solid organ transplant; prior treatment with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies or other immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C; or ECOG PS ≥ 2. Patients received LIBTAYO 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks for up to 48 weeks in Study 1423 or up to 96 weeks (Groups 1 and 2), or 350 mg every 3 weeks for up to 54 weeks (Group 3) in Study 1540. Treatment continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of planned treatment. Tumor response assessments were performed every 8 or 9 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed objective response rate (ORR), defined as complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) as assessed by independent central review (ICR), and ICR-assessed duration of response (DOR). For patients with mCSCC without externally visible target lesions, ORR was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). For patients with externally visible target lesions (laCSCC and mCSCC), ORR was determined by a composite endpoint that integrated ICR assessments of radiologic data (RECIST 1.1) and digital medical photography (WHO criteria). Study 1540 In the efficacy analysis of 193 patients with advanced CSCC enrolled in Study 1540 who received LIBTAYO at either 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 350 mg every three weeks, 115 had mCSCC and 78 had laCSCC. The median age was 72 years (38 to 96 years); 83% were male; 97% were White, 2% were Asian, 1% were Black or African American, and 1% were race unknown; 45% had ECOG PS 0 and 55% had ECOG PS 1; 34% received at least one prior anti-cancer systemic therapy; 81% received prior cancer-related surgery; and 68% received prior radiotherapy. Among patients with mCSCC, 77% had distant metastases and 23% had only nodal metastases. For the responding patients presented in Table 10 below, the median time to response was 2.1 months (range: 1.7 to 22.8 months). Efficacy results based on the final analysis of Study 1540 are presented in Table 10. Table 10: Efficacy Results for Study 1540 in CSCC Efficacy Endpoints Median duration of follow up: mCSCC 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks: 18.5 months; laCSCC 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks: 15.5 months; mCSCC 350 mg every 3 weeks: 17.3 months; combined CSCC: 15.7 months Metastatic CSCC LIBTAYO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Group 1) Locally Advanced CSCC LIBTAYO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Group 2) Metastatic CSCC LIBTAYO 350 mg every 3 weeks (Group 3) Combined CSCC N = 59 N = 78 N = 56 N = 193 CI: confidence interval; NR: Not reached Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) (%) ORR (95% CI) 51 (37, 64) 45 (34, 57) 46 (33, 60) 47 (40, 54) Complete response rate Only includes patients with complete healing of prior cutaneous involvement; laCSCC patients in Study 1540 required biopsy to confirm CR 20 13 20 17 Partial response rate 31 32 27 30 Duration of Response (DOR) Number of Responders N = 30 N = 35 N = 26 N = 91 Median DOR in months Based on Kaplan-Meier estimate (Range) NR (2.8 – 38.9) 42 (1.9 – 54.6) 41 (4.2 – 46.3) 41 (1.9 – 54.6) Patients with observed DOR ≥ 6 months, n (%) The numerator includes the number of patients whose observed DOR reached at least the specified times of 6 or 12 months.

The median age was 73 years (52 to 88 years); 81% of patients were male; 92% of patients were White; the ECOG PS was 0 (38%) and 1 (62%); 58% of patients had received at least 1 prior anti-cancer systemic therapy; 92% of patients had received prior cancer-related surgery and 81% had received prior radiotherapy. One patient in the mCSCC group was dosed at 1 mg/kg. The rest received 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. With a median duration of follow-up of 13.3 months, the confirmed ORR was 50% (95% CI: 30, 70); all responses were PRs. The median time to response was 1.9 months (range: 1.7 to 7.3 months) and 85% of responders had a DOR ≥ 6 months. 14.2 Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) The efficacy of LIBTAYO in 138 patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) [unresectable locally advanced (laBCC) or metastatic (nodal or distant) (mBCC)] who had progressed on hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI) therapy, had not had an objective response after 9 months on HHI therapy, or were intolerant of prior HHI therapy was evaluated in Study 1620 (NCT03132636), an open-label, multi-center, non-randomized study. The study excluded patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy with immunosuppressant agents within 5 years; history of solid organ transplant; prior treatment with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 therapy or other immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C; or ECOG performance score (PS) ≥ 2. Patients received LIBTAYO 350 mg every 3 weeks for up to 93 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of planned treatment. Tumor assessments were performed every 9 weeks for the first 45 weeks of treatment and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by independent central review (ICR). For patients with mBCC without externally visible target lesions, ORR was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). For patients with externally visible target lesions (laBCC and mBCC), ORR was determined by a composite endpoint that integrated ICR assessments of radiologic data (RECIST 1.1) and digital medical photography (WHO criteria). A total of 138 patients with advanced BCC were included in the efficacy analysis of Study 1620. Of these, 39% had mBCC and 61% had laBCC. In patients with laBCC, the median age was 70 years (42 to 89 years); 67% were male; 68% were White and 32% were race not reported/unknown; 61% had ECOG PS 0 and 39% had ECOG PS 1; 83% had received at least 1 prior cancer-related surgery; and 50% had received prior radiotherapy. In patients with mBCC, the median age was 63.5 years (38 to 90 years); 70% were male; 87% were White and 13% were race not reported/unknown; 67% had ECOG PS 0 and 33% had ECOG PS 1; 85% had received at least 1 prior cancer-related surgery; and 59% had received prior radiotherapy. Among patients with mBCC, 35% had distant metastases only, 9% had nodal disease only, and 54% had both distant and nodal disease. Efficacy results are presented in Table 11. For the responding patients, the median time to response was 4 months (range 2 to 10.5 months) for the mBCC group and 4.3 months (range 2.1 to 21.4 months) for the laBCC group.

Patients were eligible regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression status. Patients with EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genomic tumor aberrations; a medical condition that required systemic immunosuppression; or ongoing or recent autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy were ineligible. Patients with a history of brain metastases were eligible if they had been adequately treated and had neurologically returned to baseline for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization. Randomization was stratified by histology (non-squamous vs squamous) and PD-L1 expression (<1% versus 1% to 49% versus ≥ 50%) according to the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either: LIBTAYO 350 mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks for 108 weeks plus platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, or placebo IV every 3 weeks for 108 weeks plus platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Platinum-based chemotherapy in either arm consisted of carboplatin AUC of 5 or 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 ; cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 ; carboplatin AUC of 5 or 6 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 ; or cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 . Maintenance pemetrexed was mandatory for patients with non-squamous NSCLC who received a pemetrexed-containing chemotherapy regimen in the first 4 treatment cycles. Study treatment continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or 108 weeks. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks during year 1 and every 12 weeks after year 1. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Additional efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 25 to 84), 40% age 65 or older; 84% male; 87% White, 13% Asian. Fifteen percent had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0 and 84% had ECOG PS 1; 85% had metastatic disease and 15% had stage IIIB or IIIC disease and were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation per investigator assessment; 57% had non-squamous and 43% had squamous histology; and 7% had history of treated brain metastases at baseline. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients randomized to LIBTAYO in combination with chemotherapy compared with placebo in combination with chemotherapy. Efficacy results are presented in Table 12 and Figure 1.

Only patients whose tumors had high PD-L1 expression [Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50%] as determined by an immunohistochemistry assay using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit and who had not received prior systemic treatment for metastatic NSCLC were eligible. Patients with EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genomic tumor aberrations; a medical condition that required systemic immunosuppression; autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; or who had never smoked were ineligible. Patients with a history of brain metastases were eligible if they had been adequately treated and had neurologically returned to baseline for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization. Randomization was stratified by histology (non-squamous vs squamous) and geographic region (Europe vs Asia vs Rest of world). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive LIBTAYO 350 mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks for up to 108 weeks or a platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimen for 4 to 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed maintenance for patients with non-squamous histology who received a pemetrexed containing regimen. Treatment with LIBTAYO continued until RECIST 1.1-defined progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 108 weeks. Patients who experienced IRC-assessed RECIST 1.1-defined progressive disease on LIBTAYO therapy were permitted to continue treatment with LIBTAYO (up to an additional 108 weeks) with the addition of 4 cycles of histology-specific chemotherapy until further progression was observed. Of the 203 patients randomized to receive chemotherapy who had IRC-assessed RECIST 1.1- defined disease progression, 150 (74%) patients crossed over to treatment with LIBTAYO. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). An additional efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR). The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 31 to 84), 45% age 65 or older; 85% male; 86% White, 11% Asian; and 0.6% Black. Nine percent were Hispanic or Latino. Twenty-seven percent had ECOG PS 0 and 73% had ECOG PS 1; 84% had metastatic disease and 16% had stage IIIB or IIIC disease and were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation per investigator assessment; 56% had non-squamous and 44% had squamous histology; and 12% had history of treated brain metastases at baseline. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS for patients randomized to LIBTAYO as compared with chemotherapy. Efficacy results are presented in Table 13 and Figure 2.
