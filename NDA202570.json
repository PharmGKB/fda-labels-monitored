        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hepatotoxicity: Fatal hepatotoxicity has occurred. Monitor with periodic liver testing. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI. ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) • Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Permanently discontinue in patients with ILD/pneumonitis. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) • QT Interval Prolongation: Monitor electrocardiograms and electrolytes in patients who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, or who are taking medications that prolong QT. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI. ( 2.4 , 5.3 ) • Bradycardia: XALKORI can cause bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI. ( 2.4 , 5.4 ) • Severe Visual Loss: XALKORI can cause visual changes including severe visual loss. Discontinue XALKORI in patients with severe visual loss. Monitor and evaluate for ocular toxicity throughout treatment. ( 2.4 , 5.5 ) • Gastrointestinal Toxicity in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients with ALCL or Pediatric Patients with IMT: XALKORI can cause severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis. Provide standard antiemetic and antidiarrheal agents. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI. ( 2.4 , 5.6 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.7 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome occurred in 0.1% of the 1719 patients treated with XALKORI for NSCLC across clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST ≥3 times the ULN and total bilirubin ≥2 times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in <1% of patients treated with XALKORI. Increased ALT or AST >5 times the ULN occurred in 11% and 6% of patients, respectively. One percent (1.0%) of patients required permanent discontinuation due to elevated transaminases. Increased transaminases generally occurred within the first 2 months of treatment. In Study ADVL0912, of 121 patients ages 1 to ≤21 years treated with XALKORI for relapsed or refractory tumors including ALCL and IMT, 71% and 79% had increases of AST and ALT, respectively, with increased ALT or AST >5 times the ULN in 6% each. Of the 26 patients with ALCL treated with XALKORI, 65% and 81% had increases of AST and ALT, respectively, with increases >5 times the ULN in 4% each. Of the 14 pediatric patients with IMT treated with XALKORI, 71% had increases of AST and 71% had increases of ALT. In Study A8081013, of the 7 adult patients with IMT treated with XALKORI, 57% and 43% had increases of AST and ALT, respectively. Monitor liver function tests, including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, then once a month, and as clinically indicated, with more frequent repeat testing for increased liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin in patients who develop increased transaminases. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue XALKORI for hepatotoxicity as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with XALKORI. Across clinical trials in patients with NSCLC (n=1719), 2.9% of XALKORI-treated patients had ILD of any grade, 1% had Grade 3 or 4 ILD, and 0.5% had fatal ILD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Interstitial lung disease generally occurred within 3 months after the initiation of XALKORI. In Study ADVL0912, among 121 patients ages 1 to ≤21 years with relapsed or refractory tumors, including ALCL and IMT, ILD occurred in 0.8% of patients. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Exclude other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients diagnosed with drug-related ILD/pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.3 QT Interval Prolongation QTc prolongation can occur in patients treated with XALKORI. Across clinical trials in patients with NSCLC, 2.1% of 1616 patients had QTcF (corrected QT for heart rate by the Fridericia method) greater than or equal to 500 ms and 5% of 1582 patients had an increase from baseline QTcF greater than or equal to 60 ms by automated machine-read evaluation of ECGs. In Study ADVL0912, QTc prolongation was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.1% of patients, including 8% of patients with ALCL and 7% of pediatric patients with IMT. Avoid use of XALKORI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Monitor ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue XALKORI for QT/QTc interval prolongation as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 5.4 Bradycardia Symptomatic bradycardia can occur in patients receiving XALKORI. Across clinical trials in patients with NSCLC, bradycardia occurred in 13% of 1719 patients treated with XALKORI. Grade 3 syncope occurred in 2.4% of XALKORI-treated patients and in 0.6% of the chemotherapy-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In Study ADVL0912, among 121 patients ages 1 to ≤21 years treated with XALKORI, bradycardia was reported in 14%, including Grade 3 bradycardia in 0.8% of patients. Of the 26 patients with ALCL treated with XALKORI, bradycardia (all Grade 1) was reported in 19%. Of the 14 pediatric patients with IMT treated with XALKORI, bradycardia was reported in 14% of patients, including Grade 3 bradycardia in 7% of patients. Avoid using XALKORI in combination with other medications known to cause bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine-calcium channel blockers, clonidine, and digoxin) to the extent possible. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. If bradycardia occurs, re-evaluate for the use of concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue XALKORI for bradycardia as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.5 Severe Visual Loss Across all clinical trials in patients with NSCLC, the incidence of Grade 4 visual field defect with visual loss was 0.2% of 1719 patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Optic atrophy and optic nerve disorder have been reported as potential causes of visual loss. In Study ADVL0912, visual disorders occurred in 46% of 121 patients with XALKORI, including 65% of 26 patients with ALCL and 50% of 14 patients with IMT. Of the 56 patients who experienced visual disorders, one pediatric patient with IMT experienced Grade 3 myopic optic nerve disorder. The most common visual symptoms were blurred vision and visual impairment. Assessment of visual symptoms for all patients is recommended monthly during treatment. Report new visual symptoms to an eye specialist. For pediatric and young adult patients with ALCL or IMT, obtain baseline and follow-up ophthalmologic examinations including retinal examination within 1 month of starting XALKORI and every 3 months thereafter. The ophthalmological evaluation should consist of best corrected visual acuity, retinal photographs, visual fields, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and other evaluations as appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Permanently discontinue XALKORI for Grade 3 or 4 ocular disorders or severe visual loss (best corrected vision less than 20/200 in one or both eyes) unless another cause is identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . There is insufficient information to characterize the risks of resumption of XALKORI in patients who develop visual symptoms or visual loss. A decision to resume XALKORI should consider the potential benefits versus risks to the patient. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Toxicity in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients with ALCL or Pediatric Patients with IMT XALKORI can cause severe gastrointestinal toxicities in pediatric and young adult patients with ALCL or pediatric patients with IMT [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In patients with ALCL (n=26), gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 100% of patients; Grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 27% of patients and included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis. In pediatric patients with IMT (n=14), vomiting occurred in 93%, nausea occurred in 86%, and diarrhea occurred in 64% of patients. Provide standard antiemetic and antidiarrheal agents for gastrointestinal toxicities in pediatric and young adult patients with ALCL or pediatric patients with IMT. Antiemetics are recommended prior to and during treatment with XALKORI to prevent nausea and vomiting. If patients develop Grade 3 nausea lasting 3 days or Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or vomiting despite maximum medical therapy, withhold XALKORI until resolved, and then resume at the next lower dose level. Consider supportive care such as hydration, electrolyte supplementation, and nutritional support as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of crizotinib in pregnant rats during organogenesis at exposures similar to those observed with the maximum recommended human dose resulted in embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 45 days following the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 90 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]."

The data in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to XALKORI in 1719 patients with NSCLC who received XALKORI 250 mg twice daily enrolled on Studies 1 (including an additional 109 patients who crossed over from the control arm), 2, 3, a single-arm trial (n=1063) of ALK-positive NSCLC, and an additional ALK-positive NSCLC expansion cohort of a dose finding study (n=154). The data also reflect exposure to XALKORI in 121 patients ages 1 to ≤21 years with relapsed or refractory tumors, including 26 patients with systemic ALCL and 14 pediatric patients with IMT, in a single-arm trial (Study ADVL0912). The data are also described for 7 adult patients with IMT treated with XALKORI in a single-arm trial (Study A8081013). ALK- or ROS1-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The data described below is based primarily on 343 patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC who received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily from 2 open-label, randomized, active-controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2). The safety of XALKORI was also evaluated in 50 patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC from a single-arm study (Study 3). The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) of XALKORI in patients with NSCLC are vision disorders, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, edema, constipation, elevated transaminases, fatigue, decreased appetite, upper respiratory infection, dizziness, and neuropathy. Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC - Study 1 (PROFILE 1014) The data in Table 8 are derived from 340 patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC who had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease who received treatment in a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial (Study 1). Patients in the XALKORI arm (n=171) received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. A total of 169 patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 with cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 (n=91) or carboplatin at a dose calculated to produce an AUC of 5 or 6 mg×min/mL (n=78). Chemotherapy was given by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, in the absence of dose-limiting chemotherapy-related toxicities. After 6 cycles, patients remained on study with no additional anticancer treatment, and tumor assessments continued until documented disease progression. The median duration of study treatment was 10.9 months for patients in the XALKORI arm and 4.1 months for patients in the chemotherapy arm. Median duration of treatment was 5.2 months for patients who received XALKORI after cross over from chemotherapy. Across the 340 patients who were treated in Study 1, the median age was 53 years; 16% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of 62% of patients were female and 46% were Asian. Serious adverse events were reported in 34% of patients treated with XALKORI. The most frequent serious adverse events reported in patients treated with XALKORI were dyspnea (4.1%) and pulmonary embolism (2.9%). Fatal adverse events in XALKORI-treated patients occurred in 2.3% patients, consisting of septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 6% of XALKORI-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in these patients were nausea (1.8%) and elevated transaminases (1.8%). Permanent discontinuation of XALKORI treatment for adverse reactions was 8%. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in XALKORI-treated patients were elevated transaminases (1.2%), hepatotoxicity (1.2%), and ILD (1.2%). Tables 8 and 9 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in XALKORI-treated patients. Table 8.

Patients in the XALKORI arm (n=172) received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. A total of 171 patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 (n=99) or docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 (n=72) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. Patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed unless they had received pemetrexed as part of first-line or maintenance treatment. The median duration of study treatment was 7.1 months for patients who received XALKORI and 2.8 months for patients who received chemotherapy. Across the 347 patients who were randomized to study treatment (343 received at least 1 dose of study treatment), the median age was 50 years; 14% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of 56% of patients were female and 45% of patients were Asian. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 37% of patients treated with XALKORI and 23% of patients in the chemotherapy arm. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with XALKORI were pneumonia (4.1%), pulmonary embolism (3.5%), dyspnea (2.3%), and ILD (2.9%). Fatal adverse reactions in XALKORI-treated patients in Study 2 occurred in 5% of patients, consisting of: acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, dyspnea, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, ILD, respiratory failure, and sepsis. Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 16% of XALKORI-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients treated with XALKORI were increased ALT (8%) including some patients with concurrent increased AST, QTc prolongation (2.9%), and neutropenia (2.3%). XALKORI was discontinued for adverse reactions in 15% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of XALKORI were ILD (1.7%), increased ALT and AST (1.2%), dyspnea (1.2%), and pulmonary embolism (1.2%). Tables 10 and 11 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in XALKORI-treated patients. Table 10.

Vision disorders occurred in 92% of patients in Study 3; 90% were Grade 1 and 2% were Grade 2. The median duration of exposure to XALKORI was 34.4 months. Description of Selected Adverse Reactions in Patients with Metastatic NSCLC Vision disorders: Vision disorders, most commonly visual impairment, photopsia, blurred vision, or vitreous floaters, occurred in 63% of 1719 patients. The majority (95%) of these patients had Grade 1 visual adverse reactions. There were 0.8% of patients with Grade 3 and 0.2% of patients with Grade 4 visual impairment. Based on the Visual Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (VSAQ-ALK), patients treated with XALKORI in Studies 1 and 2 reported a higher incidence of visual disturbances compared to patients treated with chemotherapy. The onset of vision disorder generally was within the first week of drug administration. The majority of patients on the XALKORI arms in Studies 1 and 2 (>50%) reported visual disturbances which occurred at a frequency of 4–7 days each week, lasted up to 1 minute, and had mild or no impact (scores 0 to 3 out of a maximum score of 10) on daily activities as captured in the VSAQ-ALK questionnaire. Neuropathy: Neuropathy, most commonly sensory in nature, occurred in 25% of 1719 patients. Most events (95%) were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. Renal cysts: Renal cysts were experienced by 3.0% of 1719 patients. The majority of renal cysts in XALKORI-treated patients were complex. Local cystic invasion beyond the kidney occurred, in some cases with imaging characteristics suggestive of abscess formation. However, across clinical trials no renal abscesses were confirmed by microbiology tests. Renal toxicity: The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from a baseline median of 96.42 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (n=1681) to a median of 80.23 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at 2 weeks (n=1499) in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC who received XALKORI in clinical trials. No clinically relevant changes occurred in median eGFR from 12 to 104 weeks of treatment. Median eGFR slightly increased (83.02 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) 4 weeks after the last dose of XALKORI. Overall, 76% of patients had a decrease in eGFR to <90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 38% had a decrease to eGFR to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and 3.6% had a decrease to eGFR to <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Relapsed or Refractory, Systemic ALK-Positive ALCL - Study ADVL0912 The safety of XALKORI was evaluated in Study ADVL0912 [see Clinical Studies 14.2 ] , which included 26 patients with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALCL after at least one systemic therapy. Eligible patients were 1 to ≤21 years of age and were required to have an absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mm 3 (750/mm 3 if bone marrow was involved), platelet count ≥75,000/mm 3 (25,000/mm 3 if bone marrow was involved), creatinine clearance ≥70ml/min/1.73m 2 , and QTc ≤480 msec. The study excluded patients with ALT >2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN, and central nervous system tumors. Patients with ALCL received XALKORI 165 mg/m 2 or 280 mg/m 2 orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure was 5.4 months (range 1.8, 82.3 months), with 46% of patients treated for at least 6 months and 35% of patients treated for at least 12 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients with ALCL treated with XALKORI. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were neutropenia (12%) and hypotension (8%). Dose interruptions and dose reductions occurred in 77% and 19% of patients with ALCL, respectively. XALKORI was discontinued for an adverse reaction in 8% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥35%), excluding laboratory abnormalities, were diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, vision disorder, headache, musculoskeletal pain, stomatitis, fatigue, decreased appetite, pyrexia, abdominal pain, cough, and pruritis. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥15%) included neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥15%) included neutropenia (62%), lymphopenia (35%), and thrombocytopenia (19%). Selected adverse reactions are summarized in Table 12. Table 12.

Pediatric patients with IMT received XALKORI 280 mg/m 2 orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Two patients received a lower dose. The median duration of treatment with XALKORI was 20.5 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 7% of pediatric patients with IMT treated with XALKORI. The most frequent serious adverse reaction was neutropenia and hypotension (7% for each). Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 71% of patients. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 29% of patients. Permanent discontinuation occurred in 29% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥35%) were vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, vision disorder, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, edema, constipation, and headache. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality (>15%) was neutropenia. Table 13 and Table 14 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in Study ADVL0912.

The safety profile of this patient group was generally consistent with the safety profile of XALKORI evaluated in patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC. The most frequent adverse reactions (≥20%) were vision disorders, nausea, and edema. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of XALKORI. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no available data on the use of XALKORI during pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of crizotinib in pregnant rats during organogenesis at exposures similar to those expected with the maximum recommended human dose resulted in embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Crizotinib was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis to study the effects on embryo-fetal development. Postimplantation loss was increased at doses ≥50 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 times the recommended human dose based on AUC) in rats. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats at doses up to the maternally toxic dose of 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.7 times the recommended human dose based on AUC) or in rabbits at doses of up to 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.6 times the recommended human dose based on AUC), though fetal body weights were reduced at these doses. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of crizotinib or its metabolites in human milk, or the effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with XALKORI and for 45 days after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating XALKORI [see Use in Specific Population (8.1) ]. Contraception XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 45 days after the final dose. Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 90 days after the final dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Based on reproductive organ findings in animals, XALKORI may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of XALKORI have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALK-positive ALCL or with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory ALK-positive IMT [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14.2 , 14.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age with ALCL or with IMT, or in any pediatric patients with NSCLC. In a study that evaluated XALKORI in combination with chemotherapy in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ALCL (Study ANHL12P1; NCT01979536), 13 of 66 (20%) patients had a Grade 2 or higher thromboembolic event, including pulmonary embolism in 6%. The safety and effectiveness of XALKORI in combination with chemotherapy have not been established in patients with newly diagnosed ALCL. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Decreased bone formation in growing long bones was observed in immature rats at 150 mg/kg/day following once daily dosing for 28 days (approximately 5.4 times the recommended human dose based on AUC). Other toxicities of potential concern to pediatric patients have not been evaluated in juvenile animals. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in clinical studies of XALKORI (n=1669), 16% were 65 years or older and 3.8% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. Clinical studies of XALKORI in patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Crizotinib concentrations increased in patients with pre-existing moderate (any AST and total bilirubin greater than 1.5 times ULN and less than or equal to 3 times ULN) or severe (any AST and total bilirubin greater than 3 times ULN) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Reduce XALKORI dosage in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with pre-existing mild hepatic impairment (AST > ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1 times ULN or any AST and total bilirubin greater than 1 times ULN but less than or equal to1.5 times ULN). 8.7 Renal Impairment Increased exposure to crizotinib occurred in patients with pre-existing severe renal impairment (CL cr less than 30 mL/min calculated using the modified Cockcroft-Gault equation for adult patients and the Schwartz equation for pediatric patients) not requiring dialysis, therefore reduce dosage of XALKORI in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (CL cr 30 to 89 mL/min)."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Crizotinib is an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases including ALK, Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (HGFR, c-Met), ROS1 (c-ros), and Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON). Translocations can affect the ALK gene resulting in the expression of oncogenic fusion proteins. The formation of ALK fusion proteins results in activation and dysregulation of the gene's expression and signaling which can contribute to increased cell proliferation and survival in tumors expressing these proteins. Crizotinib demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of ALK, ROS1, and c-Met phosphorylation in cell-based assays using tumor cell lines and demonstrated antitumor activity in mice bearing tumor xenografts that expressed echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)- or nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK fusion proteins or c-Met. In vitro, crizotinib induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation and ALK-mediated signaling in ALCL-derived cell lines (containing NPM-ALK) at clinically achievable exposures. In vivo data obtained in an ALCL-derived mouse model showed complete regression of the tumor at a dose of 100 mg/kg once daily. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In an ECG substudy conducted in 52 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, the maximum mean QTcF (corrected QT by the Fridericia method) change from baseline was 12.3 ms (2-sided 90% upper CI: 19.5 ms) following administration of XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily. An exposure-QT analysis suggested a crizotinib plasma concentration-dependent increase in QTcF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following XALKORI 250 mg twice daily, steady-state was reached within 15 days and remained stable, with a median accumulation ratio of 4.8. Steady-state observed minimum concentration (C min ) and AUC increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner over the dose range of 200 mg to 300 mg twice daily (0.8 to 1.2 times the approved recommended dosage). Absorption A single crizotinib dose was absorbed with median time to achieve peak concentration of 4 to 6 hours, and the mean absolute bioavailability of crizotinib was 43% (range: 32% to 66%). Effect of Food A high-fat meal reduced crizotinib AUC 0–INF and maximum observed plasma concentration (C max ) by approximately 14%. Distribution The geometric mean volume of distribution (V ss ) of crizotinib was 1772 L following a single intravenous dose. Protein binding of crizotinib is 91% and is independent of drug concentration in vitro. Crizotinib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is approximately 1. Elimination The mean apparent plasma terminal half-life of crizotinib was 42 hours following single doses of crizotinib in patients. The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of crizotinib was lower at steady-state (60 L/h) after 250 mg twice daily than after a single 250 mg oral dose (100 L/h). Metabolism Crizotinib is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A. Excretion Following administration of a single oral 250 mg dose of radiolabeled crizotinib dose to healthy subjects, 63% (53% as unchanged) of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 22% (2.3% as unchanged) in urine. Specific Populations No clinically significant difference in crizotinib pharmacokinetics were observed based on age, sex, or ethnicity (Asian, non-Asian). For patients <18 years of age, body weight has a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of crizotinib, with lower crizotinib exposures observed in patients with higher body weight. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, crizotinib steady-state exposure increased proportionally with dose over the dose range of 165 mg/m 2 to 280 mg/m 2 orally twice daily. At a dosing regimen of 280 mg/m 2 (approximately 2 times the recommended adult dose), geometric mean (CV%) steady-state maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of crizotinib was 621 (73%) ng/mL and AUC 0–tau was 6530 (34%) ng∙hr/mL. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Steady-state mean crizotinib AUC and C max decreased by 9% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (AST >ULN and total bilirubin ≤1 times ULN or any AST and total bilirubin >1 times ULN but ≤1.5 times ULN) compared to patients with normal hepatic function following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily. Steady-state mean crizotinib AUC increased by 14% and C max increased by 9% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (any AST and total bilirubin >1.5 times ULN and ≤3 times ULN) following XALKORI 200 mg orally twice daily compared with patients with normal hepatic function following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily. Mean crizotinib AUC decreased by 35% and C max decreased by 27% in patients with severe hepatic impairment (any AST and total bilirubin >3 times ULN) following XALKORI 250 mg orally once daily compared with patients with normal hepatic function following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Mild or moderate renal impairment (CL cr of 60–89 ml/min or 30–59 ml/min, respectively, calculated using the modified Cockcroft-Gault equation) has no clinically significant effect on the exposure of crizotinib. Following a single 250 mg dose, the mean AUC 0–INF of crizotinib increased by 79% and the mean C max increased by 34% in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min) who did not require dialysis compared to those with normal renal function (CL cr ≥90 mL/min). Similar changes in AUC 0–INF and C max were observed for the active metabolite of crizotinib [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: No clinically significant differences in crizotinib pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of a single 150 mg oral dose of crizotinib with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased crizotinib AUC 0–INF by 216% and C max by 44% compared to crizotinib alone. Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally once daily with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased crizotinib steady-state AUC by 57% and C max by 33% compared to crizotinib alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Strong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased crizotinib steady-state AUC 0–Tau by 84% and C max by 79%, compared to crizotinib alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily for 28 days increased AUC 0–INF of oral midazolam (CYP3A substrate) 3.7-fold compared to midazolam alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: Crizotinib inhibits CYP2B6 in vitro. Crizotinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. Crizotinib does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): Crizotinib does not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 or UGT2B7. Transporters: Crizotinib inhibits P-gp, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, and OCT2. Crizotinib does not inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) B1, OATP1B3, organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, or bile salt export pump transporter (BSEP)."

For patients <18 years of age, body weight has a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of crizotinib, with lower crizotinib exposures observed in patients with higher body weight. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, crizotinib steady-state exposure increased proportionally with dose over the dose range of 165 mg/m 2 to 280 mg/m 2 orally twice daily. At a dosing regimen of 280 mg/m 2 (approximately 2 times the recommended adult dose), geometric mean (CV%) steady-state maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) of crizotinib was 621 (73%) ng/mL and AUC 0–tau was 6530 (34%) ng∙hr/mL. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Steady-state mean crizotinib AUC and C max decreased by 9% in patients with mild hepatic impairment (AST >ULN and total bilirubin ≤1 times ULN or any AST and total bilirubin >1 times ULN but ≤1.5 times ULN) compared to patients with normal hepatic function following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily. Steady-state mean crizotinib AUC increased by 14% and C max increased by 9% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (any AST and total bilirubin >1.5 times ULN and ≤3 times ULN) following XALKORI 200 mg orally twice daily compared with patients with normal hepatic function following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily. Mean crizotinib AUC decreased by 35% and C max decreased by 27% in patients with severe hepatic impairment (any AST and total bilirubin >3 times ULN) following XALKORI 250 mg orally once daily compared with patients with normal hepatic function following XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Mild or moderate renal impairment (CL cr of 60–89 ml/min or 30–59 ml/min, respectively, calculated using the modified Cockcroft-Gault equation) has no clinically significant effect on the exposure of crizotinib. Following a single 250 mg dose, the mean AUC 0–INF of crizotinib increased by 79% and the mean C max increased by 34% in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/min) who did not require dialysis compared to those with normal renal function (CL cr ≥90 mL/min). Similar changes in AUC 0–INF and C max were observed for the active metabolite of crizotinib [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: No clinically significant differences in crizotinib pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of a single 150 mg oral dose of crizotinib with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased crizotinib AUC 0–INF by 216% and C max by 44% compared to crizotinib alone. Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally once daily with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased crizotinib steady-state AUC by 57% and C max by 33% compared to crizotinib alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Strong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased crizotinib steady-state AUC 0–Tau by 84% and C max by 79%, compared to crizotinib alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . CYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily for 28 days increased AUC 0–INF of oral midazolam (CYP3A substrate) 3.7-fold compared to midazolam alone [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: Crizotinib inhibits CYP2B6 in vitro. Crizotinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. Crizotinib does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): Crizotinib does not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 or UGT2B7. Transporters: Crizotinib inhibits P-gp, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, and OCT2. Crizotinib does not inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) B1, OATP1B3, organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, or bile salt export pump transporter (BSEP)."

Crizotinib was genotoxic in an in vitro micronucleus assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cultures, in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, and in in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assays. Crizotinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay. No specific studies with crizotinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility; however, crizotinib is considered to have the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in humans based on findings in repeat-dose toxicity studies in the rat. Findings observed in the male reproductive tract included testicular pachytene spermatocyte degeneration in rats given greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/day for 28 days (greater than 1.7 times the recommended human dose based on AUC).

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 ALK- or ROS1-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC - Study 1 (PROFILE 1014; NCT01154140) The efficacy of XALKORI for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC, who had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease, was demonstrated in a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled study (Study 1). Patients were required to have ALK-positive NSCLC as identified by the FDA-approved assay, Vysis ALK Break-Apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Probe Kit, prior to randomization. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as assessed by independent radiology review (IRR) committee. Additional efficacy outcome measures included objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by IRR, DOR, and overall survival (OS). Patient-reported lung cancer symptoms were assessed at baseline and periodically during treatment. Patients were randomized to receive XALKORI (n=172) or chemotherapy (n=171). Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0–1, 2), race (Asian, non-Asian), and brain metastases (present, absent). Patients in the XALKORI arm received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. Chemotherapy consisted of pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 with cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC of 5 or 6 mg×min/mL by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles. Patients in the chemotherapy arm were not permitted to receive maintenance chemotherapy. At the time of documented disease progression, as per independent radiology review, patients randomized to chemotherapy were offered XALKORI. The demographic characteristics of the overall study population were 62% female, median age of 53 years, baseline ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (95%), 51% White and 46% Asian, 4% current smokers, 32% past smokers, and 64% never smokers. The disease characteristics of the overall study population were metastatic disease in 98% of patients, 92% of patients' tumors were classified as adenocarcinoma histology, 27% of patients had brain metastases, and 7% received systemic chemotherapy as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. At the time of the final analysis of overall survival, 84% of patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm subsequently received XALKORI. Study 1 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in patients treated with XALKORI. There was no statistically significant difference in OS between patients treated with XALKORI and patients treated with chemotherapy. Table 15 and Figure 1 summarize the efficacy results. Exploratory patient-reported symptom measures of baseline and post-treatment dyspnea, cough, and chest pain suggested a delay in time to development of or worsening of dyspnea, but not cough or chest pain, in patients treated with XALKORI as compared to chemotherapy. The patient-reported delay in onset or worsening of dyspnea may be an overestimation, because patients were not blinded to treatment assignment.

The major efficacy outcome was PFS according to RECIST version 1.1 as assessed by IRR. Additional efficacy outcomes included ORR as assessed by IRR, DOR, and OS. Patients were randomized to receive XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily (n=173) or chemotherapy (n=174). Chemotherapy consisted of pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 (if pemetrexed-naïve; n=99) or docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 (n=72) intravenously (IV) every 21 days. Patients in both treatment arms continued treatment until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. Randomization was stratified by ECOG performance status (0–1, 2), brain metastases (present, absent), and prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment (yes, no). Patients were required to have ALK-positive NSCLC as identified by the FDA-approved assay, Vysis ALK Break-Apart FISH Probe Kit, prior to randomization. The demographic characteristics of the overall study population were 56% female, median age of 50 years, baseline ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (90%), 52% White and 45% Asian, 4% current smokers, 33% past smokers, and 63% never smokers. The disease characteristics of the overall study population were metastatic disease in at least 95% of patients and at least 93% of patients' tumors were classified as adenocarcinoma histology. At the time of the final analysis of overall survival, 89% of patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm subsequently received XALKORI. Study 2 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the patients treated with XALKORI. Table 16 and Figure 2 summarize the efficacy results. Table 16.

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Progression-Free Survival as Assessed by IRR in Study 2 Figure 2 ROS1-Positive Metastatic NSCLC - Study 3 (PROFILE 1001; NCT00585195) The efficacy and safety of XALKORI was investigated in a multicenter, single-arm study (Study 3), in which patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC received XALKORI 250 mg orally twice daily. Patients were required to have histologically-confirmed advanced NSCLC with a ROS1 rearrangement, age 18 years or older, ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and measurable disease. The efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DOR according to RECIST version 1.0 as assessed by IRR and investigator, with imaging performed every 8 weeks for the first 60 weeks. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were female (56%), median age of 53 years, baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (98%), White (54%), Asian (42%), past smokers (22%), never smokers (78%), metastatic disease (92%), adenocarcinoma (96%), no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease (14%), and prior platinum-based chemotherapy for metastatic disease (80%). The ROS1 status of NSCLC tissue samples was determined by laboratory-developed break-apart FISH (96%) or RT-PCR (4%) clinical trial assays. For assessment by FISH, ROS1 positivity required that ≥15% of a minimum of 50 evaluated nuclei contained a ROS1 gene rearrangement. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 17. Table 17.

ALK-positive status (confirmation of an ALK fusion) was determined locally by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization. The study excluded patients with primary cutaneous ALCL or central nervous system involvement by lymphoma. Patients received XALKORI 280 mg/m 2 (20 patients) or 165 mg/m 2 (6 patients) orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were permitted to discontinue XALKORI to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Of the 26 patients evaluated, the median age was 11 years (range: 3 to 20); 69% were male, 54% were White, 19% Black, 8% Asian. Patient enrollment by age category was 4 patients from 3 to <6 years, 11 patients from 6 to <12 years, 7 patients from 12 to <18 years, and 4 patients from 18 to ≤21 years. All patients had received multi-agent systemic therapy, 2 (8%) had received a prior HSCT and 4 (15%) had received at least 3 prior therapies. Efficacy was based on objective response rate and duration of response, as assessed by an independent review committee (Table 18). The median time to first response was 3.9 weeks (range: 3.5 to 9.1 weeks). Table 18.

Patients were required to have an ALK fusion determined locally by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Patients (n=12) received XALKORI 280 mg/m 2 twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Two patients received a lower dose. The demographic characteristics were median age 6.5 years (range: 2 to 13); 64% female; 71% White; 7% Black, 21% unknown; 21% Hispanic; and 71% had a Lansky/Karnofsky Score of 100. Patient enrollment by age was 4 patients from 2 to <6 years, 8 patients from 6 to <12 years, and 2 patients from 12 to <18 years. A total of 12 (86%) patients received prior therapy. The most common prior therapy was surgery (57%). The major efficacy outcome was objective response rate according to RECIST version 1.0 as assessed by an independent review committee (Table 19).
