        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has been evaluated in two species: rasH2 transgenic mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, once daily oral administration of cabozantinib resulted in a statistically significant increase in the incidence of malignant/complex malignant pheochromocytoma in combination with benign pheochromocytoma or in benign pheochromocytoma alone in male rats at a dose of 1 mg/kg (approximately 0.6 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended 140 mg dose). Cabozantinib was not carcinogenic in a 26-week carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice at a slightly higher exposure than the intended human therapeutic exposure. Cabozantinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in both the in vitro cytogenetic assay using human lymphocytes or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be impaired by treatment with COMETRIQ. In a fertility study in which cabozantinib was administered to male and female rats at doses of 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day, male fertility was significantly compromised at doses equal to or greater than 2.5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose), with a decrease in sperm counts and reproductive organ weights. In females, fertility was significantly reduced at doses equal to or greater than 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 50% of the human exposure by AUC at the 140 mg recommended dose) with a significant decrease in the number of live embryos and a significant increase in pre- and post-implantation losses. Observations of effects on reproductive tract tissues in general toxicology studies were supportive of effects noted in the dedicated fertility study and included hypospermia and absence of corpora lutea in male and female dogs in a 6-month repeat dose study at exposures equal to 6% and 3%, respectively, the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. In addition, female rats administered 5 mg/kg/day for 14 days (approximately equal to the human exposure by AUC at the 140 mg recommended dose) exhibited ovarian necrosis."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action In vitro biochemical and/or cellular assays have shown that cabozantinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of RET, MET, VEGFR-1, -2 and -3, KIT, TRKB, FLT-3, AXL, ROS1, TYRO3, MER, and TIE-2. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics A population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib was performed using data collected from 289 patients with solid tumors including MTC following oral administration of 140 mg daily doses. Repeat daily dosing of COMETRIQ at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in 4- to 5-fold mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady state was achieved by Day 15. Absorption Following oral administration of COMETRIQ, median time to peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations (Tmax) ranged from 2 to 5 hours post-dose. A 19% increase in the Cmax of the tablet formulation (CABOMETYX™) compared to the capsule formulation (COMETRIQ) was observed following a single 140 mg dose. A less than 10% difference in the AUC was observed between cabozantinib tablet (CABOMETYX) and capsule (COMETRIQ) formulations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Cabozantinib Cmax and AUC values increased by 41% and 57%, respectively, following a high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions in healthy subjects administered a single 140 mg oral COMETRIQ dose. Distribution The oral volume of distribution (V/F) of cabozantinib is approximately 349 L. Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Elimination The predicted effective half-life is approximately 55 hours and the clearance (CL/F) at steady-state is estimated to be 4.4 L/hr. Metabolism Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro. Excretion Approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered within a 48-day collection period following a single 140 mg dose of an investigational 14C-cabozantinib formulation in healthy subjects. Approximately 54% was recovered in feces and 27% in urine. Unchanged cabozantinib accounted for 43% of the total radioactivity in feces and was not detectable in urine following a 72 hour collection. Specific Populations The following patient characteristics did not result in a clinically relevant difference in the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib: age (20-86 years), sex, race (Whites and non-Whites), or mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as estimated by MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease equation)). The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib is unknown in patients with worse than moderate renal impairment (eGFR less than 29 mL/min/1.73m2) as estimated by MDRD equation or renal impairment requiring dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following a single oral 60 mg COMETRIQ, mean AUC0-inf for cabozantinib increased by 81% in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment and 63% in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib has not been studied in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inhibition on Cabozantinib Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy subjects increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC0-inf) by 38%. CYP3A4 Induction on Cabozantinib Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin (600 mg daily for 31 days) to healthy subjects decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC0-inf) by 77%. Cabozantinib on CYP2C8 substrates No clinically-significant effect on single-dose rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC) was observed when co-administered with cabozantinib at steady-state plasma concentrations (≥ 100 mg/day daily for a minimum of 21 days) in patients with solid tumors. Gastric pH modifying agents on Cabozantinib No clinically-significant effect on plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) was observed following co-administration of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (40 mg daily for 6 days) with a single dose of 100 mg cabozantinib to healthy volunteers. In vitro Studies Metabolic Pathways: Inhibition of CYP3A4 reduced the formation of the XL184 N-oxide metabolite by >80%. Inhibition of CYP2C9 had a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (i.e., a <20% reduction). Inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. Although cabozantinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro, a clinical study of this potential interaction concluded that concurrent use did not result in a clinically relevant effect on CYP2C8 substrate exposure. Given this finding, other less sensitive substrates of pathways affected by cabozantinib in vitro (i.e., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) were not evaluated in a clinical study because, although a clinically relevant exposure effect cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely. Cabozantinib does not inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozymes in vitro. Cabozantinib is an inducer of CYP1A1 mRNA; however, the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Cabozantinib does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4. Drug Transporter Systems: Cabozantinib is an inhibitor, but not a substrate, of P-gp transport activities and has the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Cabozantinib is a substrate of MRP2 in vitro and MRP2 inhibitors have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown."

Mortalities occurred at doses equal and greater than 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.07 times the clinical dose of 140 mg/day based on body surface area). Hypoactivity was observed at both doses tested on Postnatal Day 22. Targets were generally similar to those seen in adult animals, occurred at both doses, and included the kidney (nephropathy, glomerulonephritis), reproductive organs, gastrointestinal tract (cystic dilatation and hyperplasia in Brunner’s gland and inflammation of duodenum; and epithelial hyperplasia of colon and cecum), bone marrow (hypocellularity and lymphoid depletion), and liver. Tooth abnormalities and whitening as well as effects on bones including reduced bone mineral content and density, physeal hypertrophy, and decreased cortical bone also occurred at all dose levels. Recovery was not assessed at the 2 mg/kg dose level (approximately 0.14 times the clinical dose of 140 mg based on body surface area) due to high levels of mortality. At the low dose level, effects on bone parameters were partially resolved but effects on the kidney and epididymis/testis persisted after treatment ceased."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, COMETRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies administration of cabozantinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal lethality and structural anomalies at exposures that were below those occurring clinically at the recommended dose (see Data ). Advise pregnant women or women of childbearing potential of the potential hazard to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats, daily oral administration of cabozantinib throughout organogenesis caused increased embryo-fetal lethality compared to controls at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg (less than 1% of the human exposure by AUC at the 140 mg dose). Findings included delayed ossifications and skeletal variations at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.03% of the human exposure by AUC at the 140 mg dose). In pregnant rabbits, daily oral administration of cabozantinib throughout organogenesis resulted in findings of visceral malformations and variations including reduced spleen size and missing lung lobe at 3 mg/kg (approximately 11% of the human exposure by AUC at the 140 mg dose). In a pre- and postnatal study in rats, cabozantinib was administered orally from gestation day 10 through postnatal day 20. Cabozantinib did not produce adverse maternal toxicity or affect pregnancy, parturition or lactation of female rats, and did not affect the survival, growth or postnatal development of the offspring at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.02 times the recommended clinical dose of 140 mg based on body surface area)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Perforations and Fistulas: Monitor for symptoms. Discontinue COMETRIQ for Grade 4 fistula or perforation. (5.1) Hemorrhage: Do not administer COMETRIQ if recent history of hemorrhage. (5.2) Thrombotic Events: Discontinue COMETRIQ for myocardial infarction or serious arterial or venous thromboembolic events. (5.3) Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold COMETRIQ for at least 3 weeks before elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of COMETRIQ after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. (5.4) Hypertension and hypertensive crisis: Monitor blood pressure regularly. Interrupt for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with anti- hypertensive therapy. Discontinue COMETRIQ for hypertensive crisis or severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy. (5.5) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ): Withhold COMETRIQ for at least 3 weeks prior to invasive dental procedure and for development of ONJ. (5.6). Diarrhea: May be severe. Interrupt COMETRIQ immediately until diarrhea resolves or decreases to Grade 1. Recommend standard antidiarrheal treatments. (5.7) Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE): Interrupt COMETRIQ until PPE resolves or decreases to Grade 1. (5.8) Proteinuria: Monitor urine protein. Discontinue for nephrotic syndrome. (5.9) Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): Discontinue COMETRIQ. (5.10) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.11, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Perforations and Fistulas Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistulas, including fatal cases, were reported in 3% and 1% of COMETRIQ-treated patients (N=214), respectively. Non-GI fistulas including tracheal/esophageal, including fatal cases, were reported in 4% of COMETRIQ-treated patients. Monitor patients for symptoms of perforations and fistulas, including abscess and sepsis. Discontinue COMETRIQ in patients who experience a Grade 4 fistula or a GI perforation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Hemorrhage Severe and fatal hemorrhage occurred with COMETRIQ. The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhagic events was higher in COMETRIQ-treated patients compared with placebo (3% vs. 1%). Discontinue COMETRIQ for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Do not administer COMETRIQ to patients with a recent history of hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, hematemesis, or melena. 5.3 Thrombotic Events COMETRIQ increased the incidence of thrombotic events (venous thromboembolism: 6% vs. 3% and arterial thromboembolism: 2% vs. 0% in COMETRIQ-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively). Discontinue COMETRIQ in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or arterial or venous thromboembolic events that require medical intervention [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.4 Impaired Wound Healing Wound complications have been reported with COMETRIQ. Withhold COMETRIQ for at least 3 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer COMETRIQ for at least 2 weeks after major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of COMETRIQ after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.5 Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis COMETRIQ can an increase the incidence of treatment-emergent hypertension with Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (modified JNC criteria) stage 1 or 2 hypertension identified in 61% in COMETRIQ-treated patients compared with 30% of placebo-treated patients in the randomized trial [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Do not initiate COMETRIQ in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Monitor blood pressure regularly during COMETRIQ treatment. Withhold COMETRIQ for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with medical management; when controlled, resume COMETRIQ at a reduced dose. Discontinue COMETRIQ for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy and for hypertensive crisis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.6 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) occurred in 1% of COMETRIQ-treated patients. ONJ can manifest as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration or erosion, persistent jaw pain or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery. Perform an oral examination prior to initiation of COMETRIQ and periodically during COMETRIQ therapy. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. Withhold COMETRIQ treatment for at least 3 weeks prior to scheduled dental surgery, or invasive dental procedures, if possible. Withhold COMETRIQ for development of ONJ until complete resolution [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.7 Diarrhea Diarrhea occurred in 63% of patients treated with COMETRIQ. Grade 3-4 diarrhea occurred in 16% of patients treated with COMETRIQ [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Withhold COMETRIQ until improvement to Grade 1 and resume COMETRIQ at a reduced dose for intolerable Grade 2 diarrhea, Grade 3 diarrhea that cannot be managed with standard antidiarrheal treatments, or Grade 4 diarrhea. 5.8 Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) occurred in 50% of patients treated with COMETRIQ, including 13% Grade 3 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Withhold COMETRIQ until improvement to Grade 1 and resume COMETRIQ at a reduced dose for intolerable Grade 2 PPE or Grade 3 PPE. 5.9 Proteinuria Proteinuria was observed in 2% of patients receiving COMETRIQ, including one with nephrotic syndrome. Monitor urine protein regularly during COMETRIQ treatment. Discontinue COMETRIQ in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. 5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic finding on MRI, occurred in one (<1%) patient. Perform an evaluation for RPLS in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Discontinue COMETRIQ in patients who develop RPLS [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, COMETRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Cabozantinib administration to pregnant animals during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality at exposures below those occurring clinically at the recommended dose, and in increased incidences of skeletal variations in rats and visceral variations and malformations in rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with COMETRIQ and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.3), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]."

The safety of COMETRIQ was evaluated in 330 patients with progressive metastatic medullary thyroid cancer randomized to receive 140 mg COMETRIQ (n = 214) or placebo (n = 109) administered daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity in a randomized, doubleblind, controlled trial (Study 1) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The data described below reflect a median exposure to COMETRIQ for 204 days. The population exposed to COMETRIQ was 70% male, 90% white, and had a median age of 55 years. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients receiving COMETRIQ and resulted from hemorrhage, pneumonia, septicemia, fistulas, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and unspecified death. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients receiving placebo and resulted from septicemia, pneumonia, and general deterioration. The COMETRIQ dose was reduced in 79% of patients receiving COMETRIQ and in 9% of patients receiving placebo. The median number of dosing delays was one in patients receiving COMETRIQ and in no patients receiving placebo. Adverse reactions led to study treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients receiving COMETRIQ. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of COMETRIQ were: hypocalcemia, increased lipase, PPE, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, nausea, pancreatitis, tracheal fistula formation and vomiting. Increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were observed in 57% of patients receiving COMETRIQ after the first dose compared to 19% of patients receiving placebo (regardless of baseline value). Ninety-two percent (92%) of patients on the COMETRIQ arm had a prior thyroidectomy, and 89% were taking thyroid hormone replacement prior to the first dose. Adverse reactions which occurred in ≥ 25% of COMETRIQ-treated patients occurring more frequently in the COMETRIQ arm with a between-arm difference of ≥ 5% included, in order of decreasing frequency: diarrhea, stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), decreased weight, decreased appetite, nausea, fatigue, oral pain, hair color changes, dysgeusia, hypertension, abdominal pain, and constipation. The most common laboratory abnormalities (≥25%) were increased AST, increased ALT, lymphopenia, increased ALP, hypocalcemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Grade 3-4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities which occurred in ≥ 5% of COMETRIQ-treated patients occurring more frequently in the COMETRIQ arm with a between-arm difference of ≥ 2% included, in order of decreasing frequency; diarrhea, PPES, lymphopenia, hypocalcemia, fatigue, hypertension, asthenia, increased ALT, decreased weight, stomatitis, and decreased appetite (Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in Study 1).

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, COMETRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies administration of cabozantinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal lethality and structural anomalies at exposures that were below those occurring clinically at the recommended dose (see Data ). Advise pregnant women or women of childbearing potential of the potential hazard to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats, daily oral administration of cabozantinib throughout organogenesis caused increased embryo-fetal lethality compared to controls at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg (less than 1% of the human exposure by AUC at the 140 mg dose). Findings included delayed ossifications and skeletal variations at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.03% of the human exposure by AUC at the 140 mg dose). In pregnant rabbits, daily oral administration of cabozantinib throughout organogenesis resulted in findings of visceral malformations and variations including reduced spleen size and missing lung lobe at 3 mg/kg (approximately 11% of the human exposure by AUC at the 140 mg dose). In a pre- and postnatal study in rats, cabozantinib was administered orally from gestation day 10 through postnatal day 20. Cabozantinib did not produce adverse maternal toxicity or affect pregnancy, parturition or lactation of female rats, and did not affect the survival, growth or postnatal development of the offspring at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.02 times the recommended clinical dose of 140 mg based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of cabozantinib or its metabolites in human milk, or their effects on the breastfed infant, or milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant from COMETRIQ, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with COMETRIQ and for 4 months after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating COMETRIQ [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Contraception COMETRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with COMETRIQ and for 4 months after the final dose. Infertility Females and Males Based on findings in animals, COMETRIQ may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of COMETRIQ in pediatric patients have not been studied. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Juvenile rats were administered cabozantinib daily at doses of 1 or 2 mg/kg/day from Postnatal Day 12 (comparable to less than 2 years in humans) through Postnatal Day 35 or 70. Mortalities occurred at doses equal and greater than 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.07 times the clinical dose of 140 mg/day based on body surface area). Hypoactivity was observed at both doses tested on Postnatal Day 22. Targets were generally similar to those seen in adult animals, occurred at both doses, and included the kidney (nephropathy, glomerulonephritis), reproductive organs, gastrointestinal tract (cystic dilatation and hyperplasia in Brunner’s gland and inflammation of duodenum; and epithelial hyperplasia of colon and cecum), bone marrow (hypocellularity and lymphoid depletion), and liver. Tooth abnormalities and whitening as well as effects on bones including reduced bone mineral content and density, physeal hypertrophy, and decreased cortical bone also occurred at all dose levels. Recovery was not assessed at the 2 mg/kg dose level (approximately 0.14 times the clinical dose of 140 mg based on body surface area) due to high levels of mortality. At the low dose level, effects on bone parameters were partially resolved but effects on the kidney and epididymis/testis persisted after treatment ceased. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of COMETRIQ did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Increased exposure to cabozantinib has been observed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Reduce the starting dose of COMETRIQ in patients with mild (Child-Pugh score (C-P) A) or moderate (C-P B) hepatic impairment. COMETRIQ is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is not required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There is no experience with COMETRIQ in patients with severe renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of COMETRIQ was assessed in an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (Study 1) of 330 patients with metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Patients were required to have evidence of actively progressive disease within 14 months prior to study entry confirmed by an Independent Radiology Review Committee (IRRC) masked to treatment assignment (89%) or the treating physician (11%). Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive COMETRIQ 140 mg (n = 219) or placebo (n = 111) orally once daily, without food, until disease progression determined by the treating physician or until intolerable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by age (≤ 65 years vs. > 65 years) and prior use of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (yes vs. no). No cross-over was allowed at the time of progression. The main efficacy outcome measures of progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (OR), and response duration were based on IRRC-confirmed events using modified RECIST criteria. Of 330 patients randomized, 67% were male, the median age was 55 years, 23% were 65 years or older, 89% were white, 54% had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0, and 92% had undergone a thyroidectomy. The RET mutation status determined by a research-use assay was positive in 51%, negative in 14%, and was unknown in 35%. Twenty-five percent (25%) had two or more prior systemic therapies and 21% had been previously treated with a TKI. A statistically significant prolongation in PFS was demonstrated among COMETRIQ-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo [HR 0.28 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.40); p<0.0001], with median PFS times of 11.2 months and 4.0 months in the COMETRIQ and placebo arms, respectively. Partial responses were observed only among patients in the COMETRIQ arm (27% vs. 0; p<0.0001). The median duration of objective responses was 14.7 months (95% CI: 11.1, 19.3) for patients treated with COMETRIQ. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (median OS: 26.6 months in the COMETRIQ arm vs. 21.1 months in the placebo arm [HR = 0.85 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.12), p = 0.2409]).

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action In vitro biochemical and/or cellular assays have shown that cabozantinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of RET, MET, VEGFR-1, -2 and -3, KIT, TRKB, FLT-3, AXL, ROS1, TYRO3, MER, and TIE-2. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of orally administered COMETRIQ 140 mg on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in patients with MTC. A mean increase in QTcF of 10 - 15 ms was observed at 4 weeks after initiating COMETRIQ. A concentration-QTc relationship could not be definitively established. Changes in cardiac wave form morphology or new rhythms were not observed. No COMETRIQ-treated patients had a QTcF > 500 ms [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib was performed using data collected from 289 patients with solid tumors including MTC following oral administration of 140 mg daily doses. Repeat daily dosing of COMETRIQ at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in 4- to 5-fold mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady state was achieved by Day 15. Absorption Following oral administration of COMETRIQ, median time to peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations (Tmax) ranged from 2 to 5 hours post-dose. A 19% increase in the Cmax of the tablet formulation (CABOMETYX™) compared to the capsule formulation (COMETRIQ) was observed following a single 140 mg dose. A less than 10% difference in the AUC was observed between cabozantinib tablet (CABOMETYX) and capsule (COMETRIQ) formulations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Cabozantinib Cmax and AUC values increased by 41% and 57%, respectively, following a high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions in healthy subjects administered a single 140 mg oral COMETRIQ dose. Distribution The oral volume of distribution (V/F) of cabozantinib is approximately 349 L. Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Elimination The predicted effective half-life is approximately 55 hours and the clearance (CL/F) at steady-state is estimated to be 4.4 L/hr. Metabolism Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro. Excretion Approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered within a 48-day collection period following a single 140 mg dose of an investigational 14C-cabozantinib formulation in healthy subjects. Approximately 54% was recovered in feces and 27% in urine. Unchanged cabozantinib accounted for 43% of the total radioactivity in feces and was not detectable in urine following a 72 hour collection. Specific Populations The following patient characteristics did not result in a clinically relevant difference in the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib: age (20-86 years), sex, race (Whites and non-Whites), or mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as estimated by MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease equation)). The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib is unknown in patients with worse than moderate renal impairment (eGFR less than 29 mL/min/1.73m2) as estimated by MDRD equation or renal impairment requiring dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following a single oral 60 mg COMETRIQ, mean AUC0-inf for cabozantinib increased by 81% in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment and 63% in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib has not been studied in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inhibition on Cabozantinib Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy subjects increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC0-inf) by 38%. CYP3A4 Induction on Cabozantinib Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin (600 mg daily for 31 days) to healthy subjects decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC0-inf) by 77%. Cabozantinib on CYP2C8 substrates No clinically-significant effect on single-dose rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC) was observed when co-administered with cabozantinib at steady-state plasma concentrations (≥ 100 mg/day daily for a minimum of 21 days) in patients with solid tumors. Gastric pH modifying agents on Cabozantinib No clinically-significant effect on plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) was observed following co-administration of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (40 mg daily for 6 days) with a single dose of 100 mg cabozantinib to healthy volunteers. In vitro Studies Metabolic Pathways: Inhibition of CYP3A4 reduced the formation of the XL184 N-oxide metabolite by >80%. Inhibition of CYP2C9 had a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (i.e., a <20% reduction). Inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. Although cabozantinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro, a clinical study of this potential interaction concluded that concurrent use did not result in a clinically relevant effect on CYP2C8 substrate exposure. Given this finding, other less sensitive substrates of pathways affected by cabozantinib in vitro (i.e., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) were not evaluated in a clinical study because, although a clinically relevant exposure effect cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely. Cabozantinib does not inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozymes in vitro. Cabozantinib is an inducer of CYP1A1 mRNA; however, the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Cabozantinib does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4. Drug Transporter Systems: Cabozantinib is an inhibitor, but not a substrate, of P-gp transport activities and has the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Cabozantinib is a substrate of MRP2 in vitro and MRP2 inhibitors have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has been evaluated in two species: rasH2 transgenic mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, once daily oral administration of cabozantinib resulted in a statistically significant increase in the incidence of malignant/complex malignant pheochromocytoma in combination with benign pheochromocytoma or in benign pheochromocytoma alone in male rats at a dose of 1 mg/kg (approximately 0.6 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended 140 mg dose). Cabozantinib was not carcinogenic in a 26-week carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice at a slightly higher exposure than the intended human therapeutic exposure. Cabozantinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in both the in vitro cytogenetic assay using human lymphocytes or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be impaired by treatment with COMETRIQ. In a fertility study in which cabozantinib was administered to male and female rats at doses of 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day, male fertility was significantly compromised at doses equal to or greater than 2.5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose), with a decrease in sperm counts and reproductive organ weights. In females, fertility was significantly reduced at doses equal to or greater than 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 50% of the human exposure by AUC at the 140 mg recommended dose) with a significant decrease in the number of live embryos and a significant increase in pre- and post-implantation losses. Observations of effects on reproductive tract tissues in general toxicology studies were supportive of effects noted in the dedicated fertility study and included hypospermia and absence of corpora lutea in male and female dogs in a 6-month repeat dose study at exposures equal to 6% and 3%, respectively, the human exposure by AUC at the recommended dose. In addition, female rats administered 5 mg/kg/day for 14 days (approximately equal to the human exposure by AUC at the 140 mg recommended dose) exhibited ovarian necrosis."

      "overdosage": [
        "10 OVERDOSAGE One case of overdosage was reported in a patient who inadvertently took twice the intended dose (200 mg daily) for nine days. The patient suffered Grade 3 memory impairment, Grade 3 mental status changes, Grade 3 cognitive disturbance, Grade 2 weight loss, and Grade 1 increase in BUN. The extent of recovery was not documented."
