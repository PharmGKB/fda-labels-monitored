      "nonclinical_toxicology": [
        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has been evaluated in two species: rasH2 transgenic mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, once daily oral administration of cabozantinib resulted in a statistically significant increase in the incidence of malignant/complex malignant pheochromocytoma in combination with benign pheochromocytoma or in benign pheochromocytoma alone in male rats at a dose of 1 mg/kg (approximately 5 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended 60 mg dose). Cabozantinib was not carcinogenic in a 26-week carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice at a slightly higher exposure than the intended human therapeutic exposure. Cabozantinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in both the in vitro cytogenetic assay using human lymphocytes or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be impaired by treatment with CABOMETYX. In a fertility study in which cabozantinib was administered to male and female rats at doses of 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day, male fertility was significantly compromised at doses equal to or greater than 2.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 13-fold of human AUC at the recommended dose), with a decrease in sperm counts and reproductive organ weights. In females, fertility was significantly reduced at doses equal to or greater than 1 mg/kg/day (5-fold of human AUC at the recommended dose) with a significant decrease in the number of live embryos and a significant increase in pre- and post-implantation losses. Observations of effects on reproductive tract tissues in general toxicology studies were supportive of effects noted in the dedicated fertility study and included hypospermia and absence of corpora lutea in male and female dogs in a 6-month repeat dose study at plasma exposures (AUC) approximately 0.5-fold (males) and <0.1-fold (females) of those expected in humans at the recommended dose. In addition, female rats administered 5 mg/kg/day for 14 days (approximately 9-fold of human AUC at the recommended dose) exhibited ovarian necrosis."

        "12.1 Mechanism of Action In vitro biochemical and/or cellular assays have shown that cabozantinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of MET, VEGFR-1, -2 and -3, AXL, RET, ROS1, TYRO3, MER, KIT, TRKB, FLT-3, and TIE-2. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment."

        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Repeat daily dosing of a cabozantinib capsule formulation for 19 days resulted in 4- to 5-fold mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady state was achieved by Day 15. Absorption Median time to peak cabozantinib concentrations (T max ) ranged from 3 to 4 hours post-dose. A 19% increase in the C max of CABOMETYX compared to a cabozantinib capsule formulation was observed following a single 140 mg dose. A less than 10% difference in the AUC was observed between CABOMETYX and a cabozantinib capsule formulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Food Effect Cabozantinib C max and AUC increased by 41% and 57%, respectively, following a high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions in healthy subjects administered a single oral dose of a cabozantinib capsule formulation. Distribution The oral volume of distribution (V z /F) of cabozantinib is approximately 319 L. Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Elimination The predicted terminal half-life is approximately 99 hours and the clearance (CL/F) at steady-state is estimated to be 2.2 L/hr. Metabolism Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro. Excretion Approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered within a 48-day collection period following a single dose of radiolabeled 14 C-cabozantinib in healthy subjects. Approximately 54% was recovered in feces and 27% in urine. Unchanged cabozantinib accounted for 43% of the total radioactivity in feces and was not detectable in urine following a 72-hour collection. Specific Populations The following patient characteristics did not result in a clinically relevant difference in the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib: age (32-86 years), sex, race (Whites and non-Whites), or mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as estimated by MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease equation)). The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib is unknown in patients with eGFR < 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 as estimated by MDRD equation or requiring dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib in healthy subjects and patients with cancer, no clinically significant differences in the mean cabozantinib exposure were observed between subjects with normal liver function (total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN) and those with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5x ULN and any AST value). In a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, cabozantinib exposure (AUC 0-INF ) increased by 63% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied [see Dosage and Administration (2.7 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days), with a cabozantinib capsule formulation to healthy subjects increased single-dose cabozantinib exposure (AUC 0-INF ) by 38%. CYP3A4 Inducers: Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin (600 mg daily for 31 days), with a cabozantinib capsule formulation to healthy subjects decreased single-dose cabozantinib exposure (AUC 0-INF ) by 77%. CYP2C8 Substrates: No clinically-significant effect on single-dose rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) exposure (C max and AUC) was observed when co-administered with a cabozantinib capsule formulation at steady-state concentrations. Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: No clinically-significant effect on cabozantinib exposure (AUC) was observed following co- administration of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (40 mg daily for 6 days) with a single 100 mg dose of a cabozantinib capsule formulation to healthy subjects. In vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: Inhibition of CYP3A4 reduced the formation of the oxidative metabolite by > 80%. Inhibition of CYP2C9 had a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (i.e., a <20% reduction). Inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. Although cabozantinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro, a clinical study of this potential interaction concluded that concurrent use did not result in a clinically relevant effect on CYP2C8 substrate exposure. Given this finding, other less sensitive substrates of pathways affected by cabozantinib in vitro (i.e., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) were not evaluated in a clinical study, because, although a clinically relevant exposure effect cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely. Cabozantinib does not inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozymes in vitro. Cabozantinib is an inducer of CYP1A1 mRNA; however, the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Cabozantinib does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4. Transporters: Cabozantinib is an inhibitor, but not a substrate, of P-gp transport activities and has the potential to increase concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Cabozantinib is a substrate of MRP2 in vitro and MRP2 inhibitors have the potential to increase concentrations of cabozantinib. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown."

Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Juvenile rats were administered cabozantinib at doses of 1 or 2 mg/kg/day from Postnatal Day 12 (comparable to less than 2 years in humans) through Postnatal Day 35 or 70. Mortalities occurred at doses ≥1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.16 times the clinical dose of 60 mg/day based on body surface area). Hypoactivity was observed at both doses tested on Postnatal Day 22. Targets were generally similar to those seen in adult animals, occurred at both doses, and included the kidney (nephropathy, glomerulonephritis), reproductive organs, gastrointestinal tract (cystic dilatation and hyperplasia in Brunner’s gland and inflammation of duodenum; and epithelial hyperplasia of colon and cecum), bone marrow (hypocellularity and lymphoid depletion), and liver. Tooth abnormalities and whitening as well as effects on bones including reduced bone mineral content and density, physeal hypertrophy, and decreased cortical bone also occurred at all dose levels. Recovery was not assessed at a dose of 2 mg/kg (approximately 0.32 times the clinical dose of 60 mg based on body surface area) due to high levels of mortality. At the low dose level, effects on bone parameters were partially resolved but effects on the kidney and epididymis/testis persisted after treatment ceased."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , CABOMETYX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies administration of cabozantinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal lethality and structural anomalies at exposures that were below those occurring clinically at the recommended dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats, daily oral administration of cabozantinib throughout organogenesis caused increased embryo-fetal lethality compared to controls at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg (approximately 0.12-fold of human area under the curve [AUC] at the recommended dose). Findings included delayed ossification and skeletal variations at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.04-fold of human AUC at the recommended dose). In pregnant rabbits, daily oral administration of cabozantinib throughout organogenesis resulted in findings of visceral malformations and variations including reduced spleen size and missing lung lobe at 3 mg/kg (approximately 1.1-fold of the human AUC at the recommended dose). In a pre- and postnatal study in rats, cabozantinib was administered orally from gestation day 10 through postnatal day 20. Cabozantinib did not produce adverse maternal toxicity or affect pregnancy, parturition or lactation of female rats, and did not affect the survival, growth or postnatal development of the offspring at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.05-fold of the maximum recommended clinical dose)."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Exelixis, Inc. at 1-855-500-3935 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section and below reflect exposure to CABOMETYX as a single agent in 409 patients with RCC enrolled in randomized, active-controlled trials (CABOSUN, METEOR) and 467 patients with HCC enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (CELESTIAL). Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Renal Cell Carcinoma METEOR The safety of CABOMETYX was evaluated in METEOR, a randomized, open-label trial in which 331 patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma received CABOMETYX 60 mg once daily and 322 patients received everolimus 10 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients on both arms who had disease progression could continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The median duration of treatment was 7.6 months (range 0.3 – 20.5) for patients receiving CABOMETYX and 4.4 months (range 0.21 – 18.9) for patients receiving everolimus. Adverse reactions which occurred in ≥ 25% of CABOMETYX-treated patients, in order of decreasing frequency, were: diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), hypertension, vomiting, weight decreased, and constipation. Grade 3-4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities which occurred in ≥ 5% of patients were hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, PPE, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, lymphopenia, anemia, hypokalemia, and increased GGT. The dose was reduced in 60% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 24% of patients receiving everolimus. Twenty percent (20%) of patients received CABOMETYX 20 mg once daily as their lowest dose. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reduction in patients treated with CABOMETYX were: diarrhea, PPE, fatigue, and hypertension. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 70% patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 59% patients receiving everolimus. Adverse reactions led to study treatment discontinuation in 10% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 10% of patients receiving everolimus. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in patients treated with CABOMETYX were decreased appetite (2%) and fatigue (1%). Table 1.

NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0 CABOSUN The safety of CABOMETYX was evaluated in CABOSUN, a randomized, open-label trial in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, in which 78 patients received CABOMETYX 60 mg once daily and 72 patients received sunitinib 50 mg once daily (4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The median duration of treatment was 6.5 months (range 0.2 – 28.7) for patients receiving CABOMETYX and 3.1 months (range 0.2 – 25.5) for patients receiving sunitinib. Within 30 days of treatment, there were 4 deaths in patients treated with CABOMETYX and 6 deaths in patients treated with sunitinib. Of the 4 patients treated with CABOMETYX, 2 patients died due to gastrointestinal perforation, 1 patient had acute renal failure, and 1 patient died due to clinical deterioration. All Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were collected in the entire safety population. The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (≥5%) in patients treated with CABOMETYX were hypertension, diarrhea, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, PPE, fatigue, increased ALT, decreased appetite, stomatitis, pain, hypotension, and syncope. The median average daily dose was 50.3 mg for CABOMETYX and 44.7 mg for sunitinib (excluding scheduled sunitinib non-dosing days). The dose was reduced in 46% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 35% of patients receiving sunitinib. The dose was held in 73% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 71% of patients receiving sunitinib. Based on patient disposition, 21% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and 22% of patients receiving sunitinib discontinued due to an adverse reaction. Table 3.

The median duration of treatment was 3.8 months (range 0.1 – 37.3) for patients receiving CABOMETYX and 2.0 months (range 0.0 – 27.2) for patients receiving placebo. The population exposed to CABOMETYX was 81% male, 56% White, and had a median age of 64 years. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 25% of CABOMETYX-treated patients, in order of decreasing frequency were: diarrhea, decreased appetite, PPE, fatigue, nausea, hypertension, and vomiting. Grade 3-4 adverse reactions which occurred in ≥ 5% of patients were PPE, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, asthenia, and decreased appetite. There were 6 adverse reactions leading to death in patients receiving CABOMETYX (hepatic failure, hepatorenal syndrome, esophagobronchial fistula, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage). The median average daily dose was 35.8 mg for CABOMETYX. The dose was reduced in 62% of patients receiving CABOMETYX; 33% of patients required a reduction to 20 mg daily. The most frequent adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to dose reduction of CABOMETYX were: PPE, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, and increased AST. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 84% patients receiving CABOMETYX. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of CABOMETYX occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of CABOMETYX were PPE (2%), fatigue (2%), decreased appetite (1%), diarrhea (1%), and nausea (1%). Table 4.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic Impairment: Reduce the CABOMETYX dosage for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid in patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 2.7 , 8.6 ) Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , CABOMETYX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies administration of cabozantinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal lethality and structural anomalies at exposures that were below those occurring clinically at the recommended dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats, daily oral administration of cabozantinib throughout organogenesis caused increased embryo-fetal lethality compared to controls at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg (approximately 0.12-fold of human area under the curve [AUC] at the recommended dose). Findings included delayed ossification and skeletal variations at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.04-fold of human AUC at the recommended dose). In pregnant rabbits, daily oral administration of cabozantinib throughout organogenesis resulted in findings of visceral malformations and variations including reduced spleen size and missing lung lobe at 3 mg/kg (approximately 1.1-fold of the human AUC at the recommended dose). In a pre- and postnatal study in rats, cabozantinib was administered orally from gestation day 10 through postnatal day 20. Cabozantinib did not produce adverse maternal toxicity or affect pregnancy, parturition or lactation of female rats, and did not affect the survival, growth or postnatal development of the offspring at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.05-fold of the maximum recommended clinical dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of cabozantinib or its metabolites in human milk, or their effects on the breastfed child or milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with CABOMETYX and for 4 months after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CABOMETYX [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception CABOMETYX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CABOMETYX and for 4 months after the final dose. Infertility Females and Males Based on findings in animals, CABOMETYX may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CABOMETYX in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Juvenile rats were administered cabozantinib at doses of 1 or 2 mg/kg/day from Postnatal Day 12 (comparable to less than 2 years in humans) through Postnatal Day 35 or 70. Mortalities occurred at doses ≥1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.16 times the clinical dose of 60 mg/day based on body surface area). Hypoactivity was observed at both doses tested on Postnatal Day 22. Targets were generally similar to those seen in adult animals, occurred at both doses, and included the kidney (nephropathy, glomerulonephritis), reproductive organs, gastrointestinal tract (cystic dilatation and hyperplasia in Brunner’s gland and inflammation of duodenum; and epithelial hyperplasia of colon and cecum), bone marrow (hypocellularity and lymphoid depletion), and liver. Tooth abnormalities and whitening as well as effects on bones including reduced bone mineral content and density, physeal hypertrophy, and decreased cortical bone also occurred at all dose levels. Recovery was not assessed at a dose of 2 mg/kg (approximately 0.32 times the clinical dose of 60 mg based on body surface area) due to high levels of mortality. At the low dose level, effects on bone parameters were partially resolved but effects on the kidney and epididymis/testis persisted after treatment ceased. 8.5 Geriatric Use In CABOSUN and METEOR, 41% of 409 patients treated with CABOMETYX were age 65 years and older, and 8% were 75 years and older. In CELESTIAL, 49% of 467 patients treated with CABOMETYX were age 65 years and older, and 15% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Increased exposure to cabozantinib has been observed in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Reduce the CABOMETYX dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid CABOMETYX in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), since it has not been studied in this population [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. There is no experience with CABOMETYX in patients with severe renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Renal Cell Carcinoma Previously Treated with Anti-angiogenic Therapy The efficacy of CABOMETYX was evaluated in METEOR (NCT01865747), a randomized (1:1), open-label, multicenter trial of CABOMETYX versus everolimus conducted in patients with advanced RCC who had received at least 1 prior anti-angiogenic therapy. Patients had to have a Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 70%. Patients were stratified by the number of prior VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Risk Group. Patients were randomized to receive CABOMETYX (N=330) 60 mg orally once daily or everolimus (N=328) 10 mg orally once daily. The majority of the patients were male (75%), with a median age of 62 years. Sixty-nine percent (69%) received only one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. Patient distribution by MSKCC risk groups was 46% favorable (0 risk factors), 42% intermediate (1 risk factor), and 13% poor (2 or 3 risk factors). Fifty-four percent (54%) of patients had 3 or more organs with metastatic disease, including lung (63%), lymph nodes (62%), liver (29%), and bone (22%). The main efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a blinded independent radiology review committee among the first 375 subjects randomized. Other efficacy endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) in the Intent-to- Treat (ITT) population. Tumor assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months, then every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients received treatment until disease progression or experiencing unacceptable toxicity. Patients on both arms who had disease progression could continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Statistically significant improvements in PFS, OS, and ORR were demonstrated for CABOMETYX compared to everolimus. Efficacy results are presented in Tables 6 and 7 and Figures 1 and 2 .

Patients were randomized to receive CABOMETYX (N=79) 60 mg orally once daily or sunitinib (N=78) 50 mg orally once daily (4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients were required to have intermediate or poor risk disease as defined by the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group categories. Patients were stratified by IMDC risk group and presence of bone metastases (yes/no). The majority of patients were male (78%), with a median age of 63 years. Patient distribution by IMDC risk groups was 81% intermediate (1-2 risk factors) and 19% poor (≥3 risk factors). Thirty-six percent (36%) patients had bone metastases. Forty-six percent (46%) of patients were ECOG 0, 41% ECOG 1, and 13% ECOG 2. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) by a retrospective blinded independent radiology review committee (BIRC). A statistically significant improvement in PFS, as assessed by a blinded independent radiology review committee, was demonstrated for CABOMETYX compared to sunitinib.

Patients were randomized to receive CABOMETYX 60 mg orally once daily or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by etiology of disease (hepatitis B virus [HBV] with or without hepatitis C virus [HCV] vs. HCV [without HBV] vs. other [without HBV and HCV]), geographic region (Asia vs. other regions), and presence of extrahepatic spread of disease and/or macrovascular invasion (yes vs. no). The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Additional outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by investigators per RECIST 1.1. Tumor assessments were conducted every 8 weeks. In CELESTIAL, a total of 707 patients were randomized, 470 to CABOMETYX and 237 to placebo. The median age was 64 years (range 22 to 86 years), 82% were male, 56% were White and 34% were Asian. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (53%) or 1 (47%). The etiology of HCC was attributed to HBV in 38% of patients and HCV in 21%; etiology was attributed to causes other than HBV or HCV in 40%. Macroscopic vascular invasion or extra-hepatic tumor spread was present in 78% of patients and 41% had alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels ≥ 400 mcg/L. All patients received prior sorafenib and 27% received two prior systemic therapy regimens. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 9 , Figure 5 , and Figure 6 .

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action In vitro biochemical and/or cellular assays have shown that cabozantinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of MET, VEGFR-1, -2 and -3, AXL, RET, ROS1, TYRO3, MER, KIT, TRKB, FLT-3, and TIE-2. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response or –safety relationship for cabozantinib is unknown. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of cabozantinib on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in patients with medullary thyroid cancer administered a cabozantinib capsule formulation. A mean increase in QTcF of 10 - 15 ms was observed at 4 weeks after initiation. A concentration-QTc relationship could not be definitively established. Changes in cardiac wave form morphology or new rhythms were not observed. No patients in this study had a confirmed QTcF > 500 ms nor did any patients in METEOR, CABOSUN, or CELESTIAL. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Repeat daily dosing of a cabozantinib capsule formulation for 19 days resulted in 4- to 5-fold mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady state was achieved by Day 15. Absorption Median time to peak cabozantinib concentrations (T max ) ranged from 3 to 4 hours post-dose. A 19% increase in the C max of CABOMETYX compared to a cabozantinib capsule formulation was observed following a single 140 mg dose. A less than 10% difference in the AUC was observed between CABOMETYX and a cabozantinib capsule formulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Food Effect Cabozantinib C max and AUC increased by 41% and 57%, respectively, following a high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions in healthy subjects administered a single oral dose of a cabozantinib capsule formulation. Distribution The oral volume of distribution (V z /F) of cabozantinib is approximately 319 L. Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Elimination The predicted terminal half-life is approximately 99 hours and the clearance (CL/F) at steady-state is estimated to be 2.2 L/hr. Metabolism Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro. Excretion Approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered within a 48-day collection period following a single dose of radiolabeled 14 C-cabozantinib in healthy subjects. Approximately 54% was recovered in feces and 27% in urine. Unchanged cabozantinib accounted for 43% of the total radioactivity in feces and was not detectable in urine following a 72-hour collection. Specific Populations The following patient characteristics did not result in a clinically relevant difference in the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib: age (32-86 years), sex, race (Whites and non-Whites), or mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as estimated by MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease equation)). The pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib is unknown in patients with eGFR < 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 as estimated by MDRD equation or requiring dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of cabozantinib in healthy subjects and patients with cancer, no clinically significant differences in the mean cabozantinib exposure were observed between subjects with normal liver function (total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN) and those with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5x ULN and any AST value). In a dedicated pharmacokinetic study, cabozantinib exposure (AUC 0-INF ) increased by 63% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied [see Dosage and Administration (2.7 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days), with a cabozantinib capsule formulation to healthy subjects increased single-dose cabozantinib exposure (AUC 0-INF ) by 38%. CYP3A4 Inducers: Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin (600 mg daily for 31 days), with a cabozantinib capsule formulation to healthy subjects decreased single-dose cabozantinib exposure (AUC 0-INF ) by 77%. CYP2C8 Substrates: No clinically-significant effect on single-dose rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) exposure (C max and AUC) was observed when co-administered with a cabozantinib capsule formulation at steady-state concentrations. Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: No clinically-significant effect on cabozantinib exposure (AUC) was observed following co- administration of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (40 mg daily for 6 days) with a single 100 mg dose of a cabozantinib capsule formulation to healthy subjects. In vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: Inhibition of CYP3A4 reduced the formation of the oxidative metabolite by > 80%. Inhibition of CYP2C9 had a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (i.e., a <20% reduction). Inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. Although cabozantinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro, a clinical study of this potential interaction concluded that concurrent use did not result in a clinically relevant effect on CYP2C8 substrate exposure. Given this finding, other less sensitive substrates of pathways affected by cabozantinib in vitro (i.e., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) were not evaluated in a clinical study, because, although a clinically relevant exposure effect cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely. Cabozantinib does not inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozymes in vitro. Cabozantinib is an inducer of CYP1A1 mRNA; however, the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Cabozantinib does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4. Transporters: Cabozantinib is an inhibitor, but not a substrate, of P-gp transport activities and has the potential to increase concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Cabozantinib is a substrate of MRP2 in vitro and MRP2 inhibitors have the potential to increase concentrations of cabozantinib. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has been evaluated in two species: rasH2 transgenic mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, once daily oral administration of cabozantinib resulted in a statistically significant increase in the incidence of malignant/complex malignant pheochromocytoma in combination with benign pheochromocytoma or in benign pheochromocytoma alone in male rats at a dose of 1 mg/kg (approximately 5 times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended 60 mg dose). Cabozantinib was not carcinogenic in a 26-week carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice at a slightly higher exposure than the intended human therapeutic exposure. Cabozantinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in both the in vitro cytogenetic assay using human lymphocytes or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be impaired by treatment with CABOMETYX. In a fertility study in which cabozantinib was administered to male and female rats at doses of 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day, male fertility was significantly compromised at doses equal to or greater than 2.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 13-fold of human AUC at the recommended dose), with a decrease in sperm counts and reproductive organ weights. In females, fertility was significantly reduced at doses equal to or greater than 1 mg/kg/day (5-fold of human AUC at the recommended dose) with a significant decrease in the number of live embryos and a significant increase in pre- and post-implantation losses. Observations of effects on reproductive tract tissues in general toxicology studies were supportive of effects noted in the dedicated fertility study and included hypospermia and absence of corpora lutea in male and female dogs in a 6-month repeat dose study at plasma exposures (AUC) approximately 0.5-fold (males) and <0.1-fold (females) of those expected in humans at the recommended dose. In addition, female rats administered 5 mg/kg/day for 14 days (approximately 9-fold of human AUC at the recommended dose) exhibited ovarian necrosis."
