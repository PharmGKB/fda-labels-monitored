( 7.1 ) P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates: Monitor for adverse reactions of narrow therapeutic agents that are P-gp substrates when used concomitantly with NERLYNX. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on NERLYNX Table 12 includes drug interactions that affect the pharmacokinetics of neratinib. Table 12: Drug Interactions That Affect Neratinib AUC=Area Under Curve; C max =Maximum Concentration * These examples are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may fit this category. The healthcare provider should consult appropriate references for comprehensive information. Gastric Acid Reducing Agents Clinical Impact Concomitant use of NERLYNX with a proton pump inhibitor, H 2 -receptor antagonist, or antacid may decrease neratinib plasma concentration. Decreased neratinib AUC may reduce NERLYNX activity. Lansoprazole (PPI) resulted in a decrease of neratinib C max by 71% and AUC by 65% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Prevention or Management PPIs Avoid concomitant use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . H 2 -receptor antagonists Take NERLYNX at least 2 hours before the next dose of the H 2 -receptor antagonist or 10 hours after the H 2 -receptor antagonist [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Antacids Separate NERLYNX dosing by 3 hours after antacids [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Concomitant use of NERLYNX with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) increased neratinib C max by 221% and AUC by 381% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant use of NERLYNX with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase neratinib concentrations. Increased neratinib concentrations may increase the risk of toxicity. Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use of NERLYNX with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp Dual Inhibitors Clinical Impact Simulated concomitant use of NERLYNX with a moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp dual inhibitor (verapamil) suggest the neratinib C max and AUC may increase by 203% and 299%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant use of NERLYNX with other moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp dual inhibitors may increase neratinib concentrations. Increased neratinib concentrations may increase the risk of toxicity. Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use of NERLYNX with other moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp dual inhibitors. Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Concomitant use of NERLYNX with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) reduced neratinib C max by 76% and AUC by 87% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concomitant use of NERLYNX with other strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers may decrease NERLYNX concentrations. Decreased neratinib AUC may reduce NERLYNX activity. Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use of NERLYNX with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. 7.2 Effect of NERLYNX on Other Drugs P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates Concomitant use of NERLYNX with digoxin, a P-gp substrate, increased digoxin concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Increased concentrations of digoxin may lead to increased risk of adverse reactions including cardiac toxicity. Refer to the digoxin prescribing information for dosage adjustment recommendations due to drug interactions. NERLYNX may inhibit the transport of other P-gp substrates (e.g., dabigatran, fexofenadine)."

NERLYNX may cause serious side effects, including: Diarrhea. Diarrhea is a common side effect of NERLYNX, but it can also be severe. You may lose too much body salts and fluid, and get dehydrated. When you start NERLYNX, your healthcare provider should prescribe the medicine loperamide for you during your first 2 months (56 days) of NERLYNX and then as needed or alternatively, prescribe you a lower dose of NERLYNX, with loperamide as needed, for the first 2 weeks prior to reaching the recommended full dose NERLYNX regimen. If you are receiving the full dose of NERLYNX from the start of your treatment, be sure that your healthcare provider prescribes anti-diarrheals with NERLYNX. Anti-diarrheals must be started with the first dose of NERLYNX. To help prevent or reduce diarrhea: You should start taking loperamide with your first dose of NERLYNX. Keep taking loperamide during the first 2 months (56 days) of NERLYNX treatment and then as needed. Your healthcare provider will tell you exactly how much and how often to take this medicine. Your healthcare provider may also need to give you other medicines to manage diarrhea when you start treatment with NERLYNX. Follow your healthcare provider's instructions on how to use these anti-diarrheal medicines. Always take anti-diarrheals exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. While taking anti-diarrheals, you and your healthcare provider should try to keep the number of bowel movements that you have at 1 or 2 bowel movements each day. Tell your healthcare provider if you have more than 2 bowel movements in 1 day, or you have diarrhea that does not go away. Call your healthcare provider right away, as instructed, if you have severe diarrhea or if you have diarrhea along with weakness, dizziness, or fever. After 2 months (56 days) of treatment with NERLYNX, follow your healthcare provider's instructions about taking loperamide as needed to control diarrhea. If you are starting at a lower dose of NERLYNX for 2 weeks then increasing to full dose of NERLYNX, please ask your healthcare provider about taking antidiarrheals as needed for the management of your diarrehea. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of NERLYNX, temporarily stop or completely stop NERLYNX if needed to manage your diarrhea.

NERLYNX is a prescription medicine used alone to treat adults with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer and who have previously been treated with trastuzumab-based therapy. NERLYNX is also used with a medicine called capecitabine to treat adults with HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) and who have received 2 or more anti-HER2 therapy medicines for metastatic breast cancer. It is not known if NERLYNX is safe and effective in children. Before taking NERLYNX, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have liver problems. You may need a lower dose of NERLYNX. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. NERLYNX can harm your unborn baby. If you are a female who can become pregnant: Your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start taking NERLYNX. You should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment and for at least 1 month after your last dose of NERLYNX. Talk with your healthcare provider about forms of birth control that you can use during this time. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant during treatment with NERLYNX. Males with female partners who can become pregnant should use effective birth control during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of NERLYNX. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if NERLYNX passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment and for at least 1 month after your last dose of NERLYNX. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take medicines used to decrease stomach acid, called proton pump inhibitors or PPIs. You should avoid taking these medicines during treatment with NERLYNX. How should I take NERLYNX? Take NERLYNX exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of NERLYNX if needed. Take NERLYNX with food. Take NERLYNX at about the same time each day. Swallow NERLYNX tablets whole. Do not chew, crush, or split NERLYNX tablets. If you take an antacid medicine, take NERLYNX 3 hours after the antacid medicine. If you take an acid reducer (H 2 receptor blocker), NERLYNX should be taken at least 2 hours before or 10 hours after you take these medicines. If you miss a dose of NERLYNX, skip that dose and take your next dose at your regular scheduled time. If you take too much NERLYNX, call your healthcare provider right away or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. What should I avoid while taking NERLYNX?

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral neratinib doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day. Neratinib was not carcinogenic in male and female rats at exposure levels >25 times the AUC in patients receiving the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day. Neratinib was not carcinogenic in a 26-week study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice when administered daily by oral gavage at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in males and 125 mg/kg/day in females. Neratinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (AMES) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay or an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. In a fertility study in rats, neratinib administration up to 12 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day in patients on a mg/m 2 basis) caused no effects on mating or the ability of animals to become pregnant. In repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs with oral administration of neratinib daily for up to 39 weeks, tubular hypoplasia of the testes was observed at ≥0.5 mg/kg/day. This finding was observed at AUCs that were approximately 0.4 times the AUC in patients at the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg."

        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Neratinib is an intracellular kinase inhibitor that irreversibly binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, and HER4. In vitro , neratinib reduces EGFR and HER2 autophosphorylation, downstream MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, and showed antitumor activity in EGFR and/or HER2 expressing carcinoma cell lines. Neratinib human metabolites M3, M6, M7 and M11 inhibited the activity of EGFR, HER2, and HER4 in vitro. In vivo , oral administration of neratinib inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft models with tumor cell lines expressing HER2 and EGFR."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Neratinib exhibits a non-linear PK profile with less than dose proportional increase of AUC with the increasing daily dose over the range of 40 to 400 mg. Absorption The neratinib and major active metabolites M3, M6 and M7 peak concentrations are reached in the range of 2 to 8 hours after oral administration. Effect of Food The food-effect assessment was conducted in healthy volunteers who received NERLYNX 240 mg under fasting conditions and with high-fat food (approximately 55% fat, 31% carbohydrate, and 14% protein) or standard breakfast (approximately 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein). A high-fat meal increased neratinib C max and AUC inf by 70% (90% CI: 1.1–2.7) and 120% (90% CI: 1.4–3.5), respectively. A standard breakfast increased the C max and AUC inf by 20% (90% CI: 0.97–1.42) and 10% (90% CI: 1.02–1.24), respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Distribution In patients, following multiple doses of NERLYNX, the mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss /F) was 6433 (19%) L. In vitro protein binding of neratinib in human plasma was greater than 99% and independent of concentration. Neratinib bound predominantly to human serum albumin and human alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Elimination Following 7 days of daily 240 mg oral doses of NERLYNX in healthy subjects, the mean (%CV) plasma half-life of neratinib, M3, M6, and M7 was 14.6 (38%), 21.6 (77%), 13.8 (50%) and 10.4 (33%) hours, respectively. The mean elimination half-life of neratinib ranged from 7 to 17 hours following a single oral dose in patients. Following multiple doses of NERLYNX at once-daily 240 mg in cancer patients, the mean (%CV) CL/F after first dose and at steady state (day 21) were 216 (34%) and 281 (40%) L/hour, respectively. Metabolism Neratinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO). After oral administration of NERLYNX, neratinib represents the most prominent component in plasma. At steady state after 240 mg daily oral doses of NERLYNX in a healthy subject study (n=25), the systemic exposures (AUC) of the active metabolites M3, M6, M7 and M11were 15%, 33%, 22% and 4% of the systemic neratinib exposure (AUC) respectively. Excretion After oral administration of 200 mg (0.83 times of approved recommended dosage) radiolabeled neratinib oral formulation, fecal excretion accounted for approximately 97% and urinary excretion accounted for 1.1% of the total dose. Sixty-one percent of the excreted radioactivity was recovered within 96 hours and 98% was recovered after 10 days. Specific Populations Age, gender, race, and renal function do not have a clinically significant effect on neratinib pharmacokinetics. Patients With Hepatic Impairment Neratinib is mainly metabolized in the liver. Single doses of 120 mg NERLYNX were evaluated in non-cancer patients with chronic hepatic impairment (n=6 each in Child Pugh Class A, B, and C) and in healthy subjects (n=9) with normal hepatic function. Neratinib exposures in the patients with Child Pugh Class A (mild impairment) and Child Pugh Class B (moderate impairment) were similar to that in normal healthy volunteers. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) had neratinib C max and AUC increased by 173% and 181%, respectively, as compared to the normal hepatic function controls [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: NERLYNX solubility decreases with increasing GI tract pH values. Drugs that alter the pH values of the GI tract may alter the solubility of neratinib and hence its absorption and systemic exposure. When multiple doses of lansoprazole (30 mg daily), a proton pump inhibitor, were co-administered with a single 240 mg oral dose of NERLYNX, the neratinib C max and AUC decreased by 71% and 65%, respectively. When a single oral dose of 240 mg NERLYNX was administered 2 hours following a daily dose of 300 mg ranitidine, an H 2 receptor antagonist, the neratinib C max and AUC were reduced by 57% and 48%, respectively. When a single oral dose of 240 mg NERLYNX was administered 2 hours prior to 150 mg ranitidine twice daily (administered in the morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart), the neratinib C max and AUC were reduced by 44% and 32%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Concomitant use of ketoconazole (400 mg once-daily for 5 days), a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of P-gp, with a single oral 240 mg NERLYNX dose in healthy subjects (n=24) increased neratinib C max by 221% and AUC by 381% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp dual Inhibitors: Simulations using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models suggested that a moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp dual inhibitor (verapamil) may increase the C max and AUC of neratinib by 203% and 299%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: Simulations using PBPK models suggested that a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (fluconazole) may increase the C max and AUC of neratinib by 30% and 68%, respectively. Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Concomitant use of rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, with a single oral 240 mg NERLYNX dose in healthy subjects (n=24) reduced neratinib C max by 76% and AUC by 87%. The AUC of active metabolites M6 and M7 were also reduced by 37–49% when compared to NERLYNX administered alone. Simulations using PBPK models suggested that a moderate CYP3A4 inducer (efavirenz) may decrease the C max and AUC of neratinib by 36% and 52%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Effect of NERLYNX on P-gp Transporters: Concomitant use of digoxin (a single 0.5 mg oral dose), a P-gp substrate, with multiple oral doses of NERLYNX 240 mg in healthy subjects (n=18) increased the mean digoxin C max by 54% and AUC by 32% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, NERLYNX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of neratinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in abortions, embryo-fetal death and fetal abnormalities in rabbits at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 0.2 times exposures in patients at the recommended dose ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk of major birth defects is 2%–4% and of miscarriage is 15%–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population. Data Animal Data In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats, neratinib was administered orally for 15 days before mating to Day 7 of pregnancy, which did not cause embryonic toxicity at doses up to 12 mg/kg/day in the presence of maternal toxicity. A dose of 12 mg/kg/day in rats is approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day in patients on a mg/m 2 basis. In an embryo-fetal development study in rats, pregnant animals received oral doses of neratinib up to 15 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. No effects on embryo-fetal development or survival were observed. Maternal toxicity was evident at 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 times the AUC in patients receiving the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses of neratinib up to 9 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. Administration of neratinib at doses ≥6 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal toxicity, abortions, and embryo-fetal death (increased resorptions). Neratinib administration resulted in increased incidence of fetal gross external (domed head), soft tissue (dilation of the brain ventricles and ventricular septal defect), and skeletal (misshapen anterior fontanelles and enlarged anterior and/or posterior fontanelles) abnormalities at ≥3 mg/kg/day. The AUC (0-t) at 6 mg/kg/day and 9 mg/kg/day in rabbits were approximately 0.5 and 0.8 times, respectively, the AUCs in patients receiving the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day. In a peri- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of neratinib from gestation day 7 until lactation day 20 resulted in maternal toxicity at ≥10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4 times the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day in patients on a mg/m 2 basis) including decreased body weights, body weight gains, and food consumption. Effects on long-term memory were observed in male offspring at maternal doses ≥5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2 times the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day in patients on a mg/m 2 basis)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diarrhea: Aggressively manage diarrhea. If diarrhea occurs despite recommended prophylaxis, treat with additional antidiarrheals, fluids, and electrolytes as clinically indicated. Withhold NERLYNX in patients experiencing severe and/or persistent diarrhea. Permanently discontinue NERLYNX in patients experiencing Grade 4 diarrhea or Grade ≥2 diarrhea that occurs after maximal dose reduction. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests monthly for the first 3 months of treatment, then every 3 months while on treatment and as clinically indicated. Withhold NERLYNX in patients experiencing Grade 3 liver abnormalities and permanently discontinue NERLYNX in patients experiencing Grade 4 liver abnormalities. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: NERLYNX can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Diarrhea Severe diarrhea and sequelae, such as dehydration, hypotension, and renal failure occurred during treatment with NERLYNX. Diarrhea was reported in 95% of NERLYNX-treated patients in ExteNET, a randomized placebo-controlled trial in the extended adjuvant setting who were not required to receive antidiarrheal prophylaxis. In the NERLYNX arm, Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 40% and Grade 4 diarrhea occurred in 0.1% of patients. The majority of patients (93%) had diarrhea in the first month of treatment, the median time to first onset of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 8 days (range, 1–350), and the median cumulative duration of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 5 days (range, 1–139) . Severe diarrhea and sequelae, such as dehydration, hypotension, and renal failure occurred during treatment with NERLYNX. Diarrhea was reported in 95% of NERLYNX-treated patients in ExteNET, a randomized placebo-controlled trial in the extended adjuvant setting who were not required to receive antidiarrheal prophylaxis. In the NERLYNX arm, Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 40% and Grade 4 diarrhea occurred in 0.1% of patients. The majority of patients (93%) had diarrhea in the first month of treatment, the median time to first onset of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 8 days (range, 1–350), and the median cumulative duration of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 5 days (range, 1–139) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Diarrhea was reported in 83% of NERLYNX plus capecitabine treated patients in NALA, a randomized placebo-controlled trial in the metastatic breast cancer setting who were required to receive anti-diarrheal prophylaxis in the first 21-day cycle. The majority of patients (70%) had diarrhea in the first 21-day of treatment, the median time to first onset of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 11 days (range, 2–728) and the median cumulative duration of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 3 days (range, 1–21). In the NERLYNX plus capecitabine arm, Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 24% of patients . Diarrhea was reported in 83% of NERLYNX plus capecitabine treated patients in NALA, a randomized placebo-controlled trial in the metastatic breast cancer setting who were required to receive anti-diarrheal prophylaxis in the first 21-day cycle. The majority of patients (70%) had diarrhea in the first 21-day of treatment, the median time to first onset of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 11 days (range, 2–728) and the median cumulative duration of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 3 days (range, 1–21). In the NERLYNX plus capecitabine arm, Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 24% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Antidiarrheal prophylaxis has been shown to lower the incidence and severity of diarrhea. Instruct patients to initiate antidiarrheal prophylaxis with loperamide along with the first dose of NERLYNX and continue during the first 56 days of treatment; after day 56, titrate dose to achieve 1–2 bowel movements per day and not to exceed 16 mg loperamide per day . Consider adding other agents to loperamide as clinically indicated . Antidiarrheal prophylaxis has been shown to lower the incidence and severity of diarrhea.

Consider adding other agents to loperamide as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Alternatively, a 2 weeks NERLYNX dose escalation approach prior to initiation of the recommended treatment regimen with NERLYNX can also be considered for diarrhea management For patients who used neratinib dose escalation, the median time to first onset of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 45 days (range, 15–132) and the median cumulative duration of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 2.5 days (range, 1–6). Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 13% of patients who used neratinib dose escalation Alternatively, a 2 weeks NERLYNX dose escalation approach prior to initiation of the recommended treatment regimen with NERLYNX can also be considered for diarrhea management [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. For patients who used neratinib dose escalation, the median time to first onset of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 45 days (range, 15–132) and the median cumulative duration of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 2.5 days (range, 1–6). Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 13% of patients who used neratinib dose escalation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Monitor patients for diarrhea and treat with additional antidiarrheals as needed. When severe diarrhea with dehydration occurs, administer fluid and electrolytes as needed, interrupt NERLYNX, and reduce subsequent doses . Perform stool cultures as clinically indicated to exclude infectious causes of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or diarrhea of any grade with complicating features (dehydration, fever, neutropenia). Monitor patients for diarrhea and treat with additional antidiarrheals as needed.

Perform stool cultures as clinically indicated to exclude infectious causes of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or diarrhea of any grade with complicating features (dehydration, fever, neutropenia). 5.2 Hepatotoxicity NERLYNX has been associated with hepatotoxicity characterized by increased liver enzymes. In ExteNET, 10% of patients experienced an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase ≥2× ULN, 5% of patients experienced an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase ≥2× ULN, and 1.7% of patients experienced an AST or ALT elevation >5× ULN (≥Grade 3). Hepatotoxicity or increases in liver transaminases led to drug discontinuation in 1.7% of NERLYNX-treated patients. NERLYNX has been associated with hepatotoxicity characterized by increased liver enzymes. In ExteNET, 10% of patients experienced an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase ≥2× ULN, 5% of patients experienced an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase ≥2× ULN, and 1.7% of patients experienced an AST or ALT elevation >5× ULN (≥Grade 3). Hepatotoxicity or increases in liver transaminases led to drug discontinuation in 1.7% of NERLYNX-treated patients. In the NALA study, in NERLYNX and capecitabine-treated patients, 7% experienced an ALT or AST >3× ULN, 2% experienced ALT or AST >5× ULN, 7% experienced a bilirubin >1.5× ULN, and 1.3% experienced a bilirubin >3× ULN. Hepatotoxicity or increases in liver transaminases led to drug discontinuation in 0.3% of NERLYNX and capecitabine-treated patients. In the NALA study, in NERLYNX and capecitabine-treated patients, 7% experienced an ALT or AST >3× ULN, 2% experienced ALT or AST >5× ULN, 7% experienced a bilirubin >1.5× ULN, and 1.3% experienced a bilirubin >3× ULN. Hepatotoxicity or increases in liver transaminases led to drug discontinuation in 0.3% of NERLYNX and capecitabine-treated patients. Total bilirubin, AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase should be measured prior to starting treatment with NERLYNX monthly for the first 3 months of treatment, then every 3 months while on treatment and as clinically indicated. These tests should also be performed in patients experiencing Grade 3 diarrhea or any signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity, such as worsening of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia . Total bilirubin, AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase should be measured prior to starting treatment with NERLYNX monthly for the first 3 months of treatment, then every 3 months while on treatment and as clinically indicated. These tests should also be performed in patients experiencing Grade 3 diarrhea or any signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity, such as worsening of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, NERLYNX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of neratinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused abortions, embryo-fetal death, and fetal abnormalities in rabbits at maternal AUCs approximately 0.2 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose.

Extended Adjuvant Treatment of Early Stage Breast Cancer ExteNET The data described below reflect the safety data of NERLYNX as a single agent in ExteNET a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of NERLYNX within 2 years after completion of adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab-based therapy in women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer. Patients who received NERLYNX in this trial were not required to receive any prophylaxis with antidiarrheal agents to prevent the NERLYNX-related diarrhea. Patients were treated with 240 mg of NERLYNX given orally once daily with food, continuously until disease recurrence or for up to one year. The median duration of treatment was 11.6 months in the NERLYNX arm and 11.8 months in the placebo arm. The median age was 52 years (60% were ≥50 years old, 12% were ≥65 years old); 81% were Caucasian, 3% Black or African American, 14% Asian, and 3% other. A total of 1408 patients were treated with NERLYNX. NERLYNX dose reduction due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 31% of patients receiving NERLYNX compared to 2.6% of patients receiving placebo. Permanent discontinuation due to any adverse reaction was reported in 28% of NERLYNX-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was diarrhea, accounting for 17% of NERLYNX-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, vomiting, rash, stomatitis, decreased appetite, muscle spasms, dyspepsia, AST or ALT increased, nail disorder, dry skin, abdominal distention, epistaxis, weight decreased, and urinary tract infection. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. Serious adverse reactions in the NERLYNX arm included diarrhea (1.6%), vomiting (0.9%), dehydration (0.6%), cellulitis (0.4%), renal failure (0.4%), erysipelas (0.4%), ALT (0.3%), AST increased (0.3%), nausea (0.3%), fatigue (0.2%), and abdominal pain (0.2%).

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, NERLYNX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of neratinib to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in abortions, embryo-fetal death and fetal abnormalities in rabbits at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 0.2 times exposures in patients at the recommended dose ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk of major birth defects is 2%–4% and of miscarriage is 15%–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population. Data Animal Data In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats, neratinib was administered orally for 15 days before mating to Day 7 of pregnancy, which did not cause embryonic toxicity at doses up to 12 mg/kg/day in the presence of maternal toxicity. A dose of 12 mg/kg/day in rats is approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day in patients on a mg/m 2 basis. In an embryo-fetal development study in rats, pregnant animals received oral doses of neratinib up to 15 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. No effects on embryo-fetal development or survival were observed. Maternal toxicity was evident at 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 times the AUC in patients receiving the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses of neratinib up to 9 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. Administration of neratinib at doses ≥6 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal toxicity, abortions, and embryo-fetal death (increased resorptions). Neratinib administration resulted in increased incidence of fetal gross external (domed head), soft tissue (dilation of the brain ventricles and ventricular septal defect), and skeletal (misshapen anterior fontanelles and enlarged anterior and/or posterior fontanelles) abnormalities at ≥3 mg/kg/day. The AUC (0-t) at 6 mg/kg/day and 9 mg/kg/day in rabbits were approximately 0.5 and 0.8 times, respectively, the AUCs in patients receiving the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day. In a peri- and postnatal development study in rats, oral administration of neratinib from gestation day 7 until lactation day 20 resulted in maternal toxicity at ≥10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4 times the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day in patients on a mg/m 2 basis) including decreased body weights, body weight gains, and food consumption. Effects on long-term memory were observed in male offspring at maternal doses ≥5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2 times the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day in patients on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of neratinib or its metabolites in human milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from NERLYNX, advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking NERLYNX and for at least 1 month after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Based on animal studies, NERLYNX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Females of reproductive potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with NERLYNX. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, NERLYNX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with NERLYNX and for at least 1 month after the last dose. Males Based on findings in animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of NERLYNX [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of NERLYNX in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the ExteNET trial, in the NERLYNX arm; 1236 patients were <65 years, 172 patients were ≥65 years, of whom 25 patients were 75 years or older. There was a higher frequency of treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the ≥65 years age group than in the <65 years age group; in the NERLYNX arm, the percentages were 45% compared with 25%, respectively, and in the placebo arm 6% and 5%, respectively. The incidence of serious adverse reactions in the NERLYNX arm vs placebo arm was 7% vs 6% (<65 years old) and 10% vs 8% (≥65 years old). The serious adverse reactions most frequently reported in the ≥65 years old group were vomiting (2.3%), diarrhea (1.7%), renal failure (1.7%), and dehydration (1.2%). In the NALA trial, in the NERLYNX plus capecitabine arm; 242 patients were <65 years, 61 patients were ≥65 years, of whom 12 patients were 75 years or older. The incidence of serious adverse reactions in the NERLYNX plus capecitabine arm in the ≥65 years age group was 36% and in the <65 years age group was 34%. The serious adverse reactions most frequently reported in the ≥65 years-old group were diarrhea (16%), acute kidney injury (8%), and dehydration (7%). No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients ≥65 years old and patients <65 years old. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose modifications are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A or B). Patients with severe, pre-existing hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) experienced a reduction in neratinib clearance and an increase in C max and AUC. Reduce the NERLYNX dosage for patients with severe hepatic impairment. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

        "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Patient Information ). Diarrhea Inform patients that NERLYNX has been associated with diarrhea, which may be severe in some cases. Advise patients to initiate antidiarrheal prophylaxis with the first dose of NERLYNX or to initiate 2 weeks of lower dose NERLYNX prior to receiving the recommended full dose of NERLYNX. Instruct patients to maintain 1–2 bowel movements per day and on how to use antidiarrheal treatment regimens. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately if severe (≥Grade 3) diarrhea or diarrhea associated with weakness, dizziness, or fever occurs during treatment with NERLYNX [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Hepatotoxicity Inform patients that NERLYNX has been associated with hepatotoxicity which may be severe in some cases. Inform patients that they should report signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction to their healthcare provider immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Advise females to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or become pregnant. Inform female patients of the risk to a fetus and potential loss of the pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 month after receiving the last dose of NERLYNX [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with NERLYNX and for at least 1 month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.2 )] . Drug Interactions NERLYNX may interact with many drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medication or herbal products [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . NERLYNX may interact with gastric acid reducing agents. Advise patients to avoid concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors. When patients require gastric acid reducing agents, use an H 2 -receptor antagonist or antacid. Advise patients to separate the dosing of NERLYNX by 3 hours after antacid medicine, and to take NERLYNX at least 2 hours before or 10 hours after a H 2 -receptor antagonist [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . NERLYNX may interact with grapefruit. Advise patients to avoid taking NERLYNX with grapefruit products [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Dosing and Administration For patients undergoing extended adjuvant treatment for early stage breast cancer, instruct patients to take NERLYNX with food at approximately the same time each day consecutively until disease recurrence or for up to one year. For patients treatment for metastatic breast cancer, instruct patients to take NERLYNX with food on days 1–21 of a 21-day cycle with capecitabine on Days 1–14 of a 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient not to replace the missed dose, and to resume NERLYNX with the next scheduled daily dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] .

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Extended Adjuvant Treatment of Early Stage Breast Cancer The safety and efficacy of NERLYNX were investigated in the ExteNET trial (NCT00878709), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of NERLYNX after adjuvant treatment with a trastuzumab based therapy in women with HER2-positive breast cancer. A total of 2840 patients with early-stage (Stage 1 to 3c) HER2-positive breast cancer within two years of completing treatment with adjuvant trastuzumab was randomized to receive either NERLYNX (n=1420) or placebo (n=1420). Randomization was stratified by the following factors: hormone receptor status, nodal status (0, 1–3 vs 4 or more positive nodes) and whether trastuzumab was given sequentially versus concurrently with chemotherapy. NERLYNX 240 mg or placebo was given orally once daily for one year. The major efficacy outcome measure was invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) defined as the time between the date of randomization to the first occurrence of invasive recurrence (local/regional, ipsilateral, or contralateral breast cancer), distant recurrence, or death from any cause, with 2 years and 28 days of follow-up. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms. Patients had a median age of 52 years (range 23 to 83) and 12% of patients were 65 or older. The majority of patients were White (81%), and most patients (99.7%) had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Fifty-seven percent (57%) of patients had hormone receptor positive disease (defined as ER-positive and/or PR-positive), 24% were node negative, 47% had one to three positive nodes and 30% had four or more positive nodes. Ten percent (10%) of patients had Stage I disease, 41% had Stage II disease and 31% had Stage III disease. The majority of patients (81%) were enrolled within one year of completion of trastuzumab treatment. Median time from the last adjuvant trastuzumab treatment to randomization was 4.4 months in the NERLYNX arm versus 4.6 months in the placebo arm. Median duration of treatment was 11.6 months in the NERLYNX arm vs 11.8 months in the placebo arm. The efficacy results from the ExteNET trial are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 1 .

This exploratory analysis suggests that the iDFS results at 5 years are consistent with the 2-year iDFS results observed in ExteNET. After a median follow-up of 8 years, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between the NERLYNX arm and the placebo arm [HR 0.95 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.21)]. The 5-year estimate of OS was 94.1% (95% CI, 92.7%, 95.3%) in the NERLYNX arm and 93.3% (95% CI, 91.8%, 94.5%) in the placebo arm. Figure 1 14.2 Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer The safety and efficacy of NERLYNX in combination with capecitabine was studied in NALA (NCT01808573), a randomized, multicenter, open-label clinical trial in patients (n=621) with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who had received 2 or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting. HER2 expression was based on archival tissue tested at a central laboratory prior to enrollment. HER2 positivity was defined as a HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+ or IHC 2+ with confirmatory in situ hybridization (ISH) positive. Fifty-nine percent of these patients were hormone receptor positive (HR+) and 41% were hormone receptor negative (HR-); 69% had received two prior anti-HER2 based regimens, 31% had received three or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens, 81% had visceral disease, and 19% had non-visceral-only disease. Patients with asymptomatic or stable brain metastases were included in NALA trial (16%). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive NERLYNX 240 mg orally once daily on Days 1–21 in combination with capecitabine 750 mg/m 2 given orally twice daily on Days 1–14 for each 21-day cycle (n=307) or lapatinib 1250 mg orally once daily Days 1–21 in combination with capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 given orally twice daily on Days 1–14 for each 21-day cycle (n=314). Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The efficacy results from the NALA trial are summarized in Table 15 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . Table 15.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Neratinib is an intracellular kinase inhibitor that irreversibly binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, and HER4. In vitro , neratinib reduces EGFR and HER2 autophosphorylation, downstream MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, and showed antitumor activity in EGFR and/or HER2 expressing carcinoma cell lines. Neratinib human metabolites M3, M6, M7 and M11 inhibited the activity of EGFR, HER2, and HER4 in vitro. In vivo , oral administration of neratinib inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft models with tumor cell lines expressing HER2 and EGFR. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of NERLYNX on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo, and positive-controlled, double-blind, single-dose, crossover study in 60 healthy subjects. At 140% the therapeutic exposures of NERLYNX, there was no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Neratinib exhibits a non-linear PK profile with less than dose proportional increase of AUC with the increasing daily dose over the range of 40 to 400 mg. Absorption The neratinib and major active metabolites M3, M6 and M7 peak concentrations are reached in the range of 2 to 8 hours after oral administration. Effect of Food The food-effect assessment was conducted in healthy volunteers who received NERLYNX 240 mg under fasting conditions and with high-fat food (approximately 55% fat, 31% carbohydrate, and 14% protein) or standard breakfast (approximately 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein). A high-fat meal increased neratinib C max and AUC inf by 70% (90% CI: 1.1–2.7) and 120% (90% CI: 1.4–3.5), respectively. A standard breakfast increased the C max and AUC inf by 20% (90% CI: 0.97–1.42) and 10% (90% CI: 1.02–1.24), respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Distribution In patients, following multiple doses of NERLYNX, the mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (V ss /F) was 6433 (19%) L. In vitro protein binding of neratinib in human plasma was greater than 99% and independent of concentration. Neratinib bound predominantly to human serum albumin and human alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Elimination Following 7 days of daily 240 mg oral doses of NERLYNX in healthy subjects, the mean (%CV) plasma half-life of neratinib, M3, M6, and M7 was 14.6 (38%), 21.6 (77%), 13.8 (50%) and 10.4 (33%) hours, respectively. The mean elimination half-life of neratinib ranged from 7 to 17 hours following a single oral dose in patients. Following multiple doses of NERLYNX at once-daily 240 mg in cancer patients, the mean (%CV) CL/F after first dose and at steady state (day 21) were 216 (34%) and 281 (40%) L/hour, respectively. Metabolism Neratinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO). After oral administration of NERLYNX, neratinib represents the most prominent component in plasma. At steady state after 240 mg daily oral doses of NERLYNX in a healthy subject study (n=25), the systemic exposures (AUC) of the active metabolites M3, M6, M7 and M11were 15%, 33%, 22% and 4% of the systemic neratinib exposure (AUC) respectively. Excretion After oral administration of 200 mg (0.83 times of approved recommended dosage) radiolabeled neratinib oral formulation, fecal excretion accounted for approximately 97% and urinary excretion accounted for 1.1% of the total dose. Sixty-one percent of the excreted radioactivity was recovered within 96 hours and 98% was recovered after 10 days. Specific Populations Age, gender, race, and renal function do not have a clinically significant effect on neratinib pharmacokinetics. Patients With Hepatic Impairment Neratinib is mainly metabolized in the liver. Single doses of 120 mg NERLYNX were evaluated in non-cancer patients with chronic hepatic impairment (n=6 each in Child Pugh Class A, B, and C) and in healthy subjects (n=9) with normal hepatic function. Neratinib exposures in the patients with Child Pugh Class A (mild impairment) and Child Pugh Class B (moderate impairment) were similar to that in normal healthy volunteers. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) had neratinib C max and AUC increased by 173% and 181%, respectively, as compared to the normal hepatic function controls [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interaction Studies Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: NERLYNX solubility decreases with increasing GI tract pH values. Drugs that alter the pH values of the GI tract may alter the solubility of neratinib and hence its absorption and systemic exposure. When multiple doses of lansoprazole (30 mg daily), a proton pump inhibitor, were co-administered with a single 240 mg oral dose of NERLYNX, the neratinib C max and AUC decreased by 71% and 65%, respectively. When a single oral dose of 240 mg NERLYNX was administered 2 hours following a daily dose of 300 mg ranitidine, an H 2 receptor antagonist, the neratinib C max and AUC were reduced by 57% and 48%, respectively. When a single oral dose of 240 mg NERLYNX was administered 2 hours prior to 150 mg ranitidine twice daily (administered in the morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart), the neratinib C max and AUC were reduced by 44% and 32%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Concomitant use of ketoconazole (400 mg once-daily for 5 days), a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of P-gp, with a single oral 240 mg NERLYNX dose in healthy subjects (n=24) increased neratinib C max by 221% and AUC by 381% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp dual Inhibitors: Simulations using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models suggested that a moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp dual inhibitor (verapamil) may increase the C max and AUC of neratinib by 203% and 299%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: Simulations using PBPK models suggested that a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (fluconazole) may increase the C max and AUC of neratinib by 30% and 68%, respectively. Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Concomitant use of rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, with a single oral 240 mg NERLYNX dose in healthy subjects (n=24) reduced neratinib C max by 76% and AUC by 87%. The AUC of active metabolites M6 and M7 were also reduced by 37–49% when compared to NERLYNX administered alone. Simulations using PBPK models suggested that a moderate CYP3A4 inducer (efavirenz) may decrease the C max and AUC of neratinib by 36% and 52%, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Effect of NERLYNX on P-gp Transporters: Concomitant use of digoxin (a single 0.5 mg oral dose), a P-gp substrate, with multiple oral doses of NERLYNX 240 mg in healthy subjects (n=18) increased the mean digoxin C max by 54% and AUC by 32% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] ."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral neratinib doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day. Neratinib was not carcinogenic in male and female rats at exposure levels >25 times the AUC in patients receiving the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day. Neratinib was not carcinogenic in a 26-week study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice when administered daily by oral gavage at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in males and 125 mg/kg/day in females. Neratinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (AMES) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay or an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. In a fertility study in rats, neratinib administration up to 12 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg/day in patients on a mg/m 2 basis) caused no effects on mating or the ability of animals to become pregnant. In repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs with oral administration of neratinib daily for up to 39 weeks, tubular hypoplasia of the testes was observed at ≥0.5 mg/kg/day. This finding was observed at AUCs that were approximately 0.4 times the AUC in patients at the maximum recommended dose of 240 mg."
