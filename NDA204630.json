Administer PROVAYBLUE ® 1 mg/kg intravenously over 5-30 minutes. If the methemoglobin level remains greater than 30% or if clinical signs and symptoms persist, a repeat dose of PROVAYBLUE ® 1 mg/kg may be given one hour after the first dose. If methemoglobinemia does not resolve after 2 doses of PROVAYBLUE ® , consider initiating alternative interventions for treatment of methemoglobinemia. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Renal Impairment The recommended dosage of PROVAYBLUE in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) is a single dose of 1 mg/kg. If the methemoglobin level remains greater than 30% or if the clinical symptoms persist 1 hour after dosing, consider initiating alternative interventions for the treatment of methemoglobinemia. 2.3 Preparation and Storage Each mL of PROVAYBLUE ® contains 5 mg methylene blue. Each 10 mL ampule and vial of PROVAYBLUE ® contains 50 mg methylene blue. Each 2 mL ampule and vial of PROVAYBLUE ® contains 10 mg methylene blue. PROVAYBLUE ® is hypotonic and may be diluted before use in a solution of 50 mL 5% Dextrose Injection in order to avoid local pain, particularly in the pediatric population. Use the diluted solution immediately after preparation. Avoid diluting with sodium chloride solutions, because it has been demonstrated that chloride reduces the solubility of methylene blue. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Keep the ampule and the vial in the original package to protect from light. Discard unused portion."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: If severe or life threatening allergic reaction occurs, discontinue PROVAYBLUE ® , treat the allergic reaction, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve ( 5.2 ) Lack of Effectiveness: Consider alternative treatments if there is no resolution of methemoglobinemia after 2 doses ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Hemolytic Anemia: Discontinue PROVAYBLUE ® and transfuse ( 5.4 ) Interference with In-Vivo Monitoring Devices: Use methods other than pulse oximetry to assess oxygen saturation ( 5.5 ) Effects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery: Advise patients to refrain from these activities until neurologic and visual symptoms have resolved ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs and Opioids The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with the use of methylene blue class products. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Opioids and dextromethorphan may increase the risk of developing serotonin syndrome. Some of the reported cases were fatal. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Avoid concomitant use of PROVAYBLUE ® with serotonergic drugs and opioids. Patients treated with PROVAYBLUE ® should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue use of PROVAYBLUE ® , and initiate supportive treatment. Inform patients of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome and advise them to not to take serotonergic drugs within 72 hours after the last dose of PROVAYBLUE ® [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.2 Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reactions to methylene blue class products have been reported. Patients treated with PROVAYBLUE ® should be monitored for anaphylaxis. If anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, bronchospasm) should occur, discontinue use of PROVAYBLUE ® and initiate supportive treatment. PROVAYBLUE ® is contraindicated in patients who have experienced anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reactions to a methylene blue class product in the past. 5.3 Lack of Effectiveness Methemoglobinemia may not resolve or may rebound after response to treatment with PROVAYBLUE ® in patients with methemoglobinemia due to aryl amines such as aniline or sulfa drugs such as dapsone. Monitor response to therapy with PROVAYBLUE ® through resolution of methemoglobinemia. If methemoglobinemia does not respond to 2 doses of PROVAYBLUE ® or if methemoglobinemia rebounds after a response, consider additional treatment options [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may not reduce PROVAYBLUE ® to its active form in vivo. PROVAYBLUE ® may not be effective in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. 5.4 Hemolytic Anemia Hemolysis can occur during treatment of methemoglobinemia with PROVAYBLUE ® . Laboratory testing may show Heinz bodies, elevated indirect bilirubin and low haptoglobin, but the Coombs test is negative. The onset of anemia may be delayed 1 or more days after treatment with PROVAYBLUE ® . The anemia may require red blood cell transfusions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Use the lowest effective number of doses of PROVAYBLUE ® to treat methemoglobinemia. Discontinue PROVAYBLUE ® and consider alternative treatments of methemoglobinemia if severe hemolysis occurs. Treatment of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with PROVAYBLUE ® may result in severe hemolysis and severe anemia. PROVAYBLUE ® is contraindicated for use in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.5 Interference with In Vivo Monitoring Devices • Inaccurate Pulse Oximeter Readings The presence of methylene blue in the blood may result in an underestimation of the oxygen saturation reading by pulse oximetry. If a measure of oxygen saturation is required during or shortly after infusion of PROVAYBLUE ® , it is advisable to obtain an arterial blood sample for testing by an alternative method. • Bispectral index monitor A fall in the Bispectral Index (BIS) has been reported following administration of methylene blue class products. If PROVAYBLUE ® is administered during surgery, alternative methods for assessing the depth of anesthesia should be employed. 5.6 Effects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery Treatment with PROVAYBLUE ® may cause confusion, dizziness and disturbances in vision [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Advise patients to refrain from driving or engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery until such adverse reactions to PROVAYBLUE ® have resolved. 5.7 Interference with Laboratory Tests PROVAYBLUE ® is a blue dye which passes freely into the urine and may interfere with the interpretation of any urine test which relies on a blue indicator, such as the dipstick test for leucocyte esterase."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Clinically significant drug interactions with PROVAYBLUE ® are described below: The concomitant use of PROVAYBLUE ® with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Although the mechanism is not clearly understood, literature reports suggest PROVAYBLUE ® is a potent reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Avoid concomitant use of PROVAYBLUE ® with medicinal products that enhance serotonergic transmission including antidepressants like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), bupropion, buspirone, clomipramine, mirtazapine, linezolid, opioids, and dextromethorphan because of the potential for serious CNS reactions, including potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. If the intravenous use of PROVAYBLUE ® cannot be avoided in patients treated with serotonergic medicinal products, choose the lowest possible dose and observe the patient closely for CNS effects for up to 4 hours after administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Only use during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Discontinue breast-feeding for up to 8 days after treatment. ( 8.2 ). Hepatic Impairment: Monitor patients longer for toxicity and drug interactions due to delayed clearance. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary PROVAYBLUE ® may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Intra-amniotic injection of pregnant women with a methylene blue class product during the second trimester was associated with neonatal intestinal atresia and fetal death. Methylene blue produced adverse developmental outcomes in rats and rabbits when administered orally during organogenesis at doses at least 32 and 16 times, respectively, the clinical dose of 1 mg/kg ( see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions Intra-amniotic injection of a methylene blue class product hours to days prior to birth can result hyperbilirubinemia, hemolytic anemia, skin staining, methemoglobinemia, respiratory distress and photosensitivity in the newborn. Following administration of PROVAYBLUE ® to a pregnant woman at term, observe the newborn for these adverse reactions and institute supportive care. Data Animal Data Methylene blue was administered orally to pregnant rats at doses of 50 to 350 mg/kg/day, during the period of organogenesis. Maternal and embryofetal toxicities were observed at all doses of methylene blue and were most evident at the 200 and 350 mg/kg/day doses. Maternal toxicity consisted of increased spleen weight. Embryo-fetal toxicities included reduced fetal weight, post-implantation loss, edema, and malformations including enlarged lateral ventricles. The dose of 200 mg/kg (1200 mg/m 2 ) in rats is approximately 32 times a clinical dose of 1 mg/kg based on body surface area. Methylene blue was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses of 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg/day, during the period of organogenesis. Maternal death was observed at the methylene blue dose of 100 mg/kg. Embryofetal toxicities included spontaneous abortion at all dose levels and a malformation (umbilical hernia) at the 100 and 150 mg/kg/day doses. The dose of 50 mg/kg (600 mg/m 2 ) in rabbits is approximately 16 times a clinical dose of 1 mg/kg based on body surface area. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of methylene blue in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions including genotoxicity, discontinue breast-feeding during and for up to 8 days after treatment with PROVAYBLUE ® [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PROVAYBLUE ® have been established in pediatric patients. Use of PROVAYBLUE ® is supported by two retrospective case series that included 2 pediatric patients treated with PROVAYBLUE ® and 12 treated with another methylene blue class product. The case series included pediatric patients in the following age groups: 3 neonates (less than 1 month), 4 infants (1 month up to less than 2 years), 4 children (2 years up to less than 12 years), and 3 adolescents (12 years to less than 17 years). The efficacy outcomes were consistent across pediatric and adult patients in both case series [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use The retrospective case series included 3 patients age 65 years and over treated with PROVAYBLUE ® (or a bioequivalent formulation) and 5 treated with another methylene blue class product. The efficacy outcomes were consistent across adult and elderly patients in both case series [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, so the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, treatment of methemoglobinemia in these patients should use the lowest number of doses needed to achieve a response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Methylene blue concentrations increased in subjects with renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Adjust PROVAYBLUE ® dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 – 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Methylene blue is extensively metabolized in the liver. Monitor patients with any hepatic impairment for toxicities and potential drug interactions for an extended period of time following treatment with PROVAYBLUE ® ."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary PROVAYBLUE ® may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Intra-amniotic injection of pregnant women with a methylene blue class product during the second trimester was associated with neonatal intestinal atresia and fetal death. Methylene blue produced adverse developmental outcomes in rats and rabbits when administered orally during organogenesis at doses at least 32 and 16 times, respectively, the clinical dose of 1 mg/kg ( see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions Intra-amniotic injection of a methylene blue class product hours to days prior to birth can result hyperbilirubinemia, hemolytic anemia, skin staining, methemoglobinemia, respiratory distress and photosensitivity in the newborn. Following administration of PROVAYBLUE ® to a pregnant woman at term, observe the newborn for these adverse reactions and institute supportive care. Data Animal Data Methylene blue was administered orally to pregnant rats at doses of 50 to 350 mg/kg/day, during the period of organogenesis. Maternal and embryofetal toxicities were observed at all doses of methylene blue and were most evident at the 200 and 350 mg/kg/day doses. Maternal toxicity consisted of increased spleen weight. Embryo-fetal toxicities included reduced fetal weight, post-implantation loss, edema, and malformations including enlarged lateral ventricles. The dose of 200 mg/kg (1200 mg/m 2 ) in rats is approximately 32 times a clinical dose of 1 mg/kg based on body surface area. Methylene blue was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses of 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg/day, during the period of organogenesis. Maternal death was observed at the methylene blue dose of 100 mg/kg. Embryofetal toxicities included spontaneous abortion at all dose levels and a malformation (umbilical hernia) at the 100 and 150 mg/kg/day doses. The dose of 50 mg/kg (600 mg/m 2 ) in rabbits is approximately 16 times a clinical dose of 1 mg/kg based on body surface area."

Administration of large intravenous doses (cumulative dose ≥ 7 mg/kg ) of a methylene blue class product caused nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, chest tightness, tachycardia, apprehension, tremor, mydriasis, blue staining of the urine, the skin and mucous membranes, abdominal pain, dizziness, paresthesia, headache, confusion, mild methemoglobinemia (up to 7%) and electrocardiogram changes (T-wave flattening or inversion). These effects lasted 2-12 hours following administration. A severe overdosage (single dose of 20 mg/kg or more) of a methylene blue class product caused severe intravascular hemolysis, hyperbilirubinemia and death. In case of overdose of PROVAYBLUE ® , maintain the patient under observation until signs and symptoms have resolved, monitor for cardiopulmonary, hematologic and neurologic toxicities, and institute supportive measures as necessary."

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Methylene blue is a water soluble thiazine dye that promotes a non-enzymatic redox conversion of metHb to hemoglobin. In situ, methylene blue is first converted to leucomethylene blue (LMB) via NADPH reductase. It is the LMB molecule which then reduces the ferric iron of metHb to the ferrous state of normal hemoglobin. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Low concentrations of methylene blue speeds up the in vivo conversion of methemoglobin to hemoglobin. Methylene blue has been observed to stain tissues selectively. The exposure-response or –safety relationship for methylene is unknown. Cardiac Electrophysiology The results of a thorough QT study demonstrated PROVAYBLUE ® at an intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg as a 5-minute intravenous infusion had no effect on the QT, PR or QRS intervals. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC of methylene blue 2,917 ng/mL (39%) and 13977 ng.hr/mL (21%) following a 2 mg/kg dose administered as a 5-minute intravenous infusion. Distribution The mean± standard deviation steady state volume of distribution of a 2 mg/kg dose of PROVAYBLUE ® was 255 L ± 58. The mean plasma protein binding of methylene blue is approximately 94% in vitro. Methylene blue exhibits concentration-dependent partitioning into blood cells in vitro. The blood-to-plasma ratio was 5.1±2.8 at 5 minutes from the start of a 2 mg/kg dose administered as a 5-minute intravenous infusion and reached a plateau of 0.6 at 4 hours in a clinical study. Methylene Blue is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) transporter, but not for BCRP or OCT2 in vitro. Elimination Methylene blue has a half-life of approximately 24 hours in humans. Metabolism Methylene blue is metabolized by CYPs 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 in vitro; however, the predominant in vitro pathway appears to be UGT-mediated conjugation by multiple UGT enzymes, including UGT1A4 and UGT1A9. Azure B, which is a minor impurity in methylene blue, is also formed in humans as a metabolite of methylene blue, with an overall drug/metabolite AUC ratio of greater than 6:1. Azure B has 8-fold lower potency than methylene blue. Excretion Approximately 40% of methylene blue is excreted into the urine unchanged. Specific Populations Renal Impairment After a single 1 mg/kg dose of PROVAYBLUE ® , AUC 0-96h increased by 52%, 116%, and 192% in subjects with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60 – 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), and severe (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.732m 2 ) renal impairment, respectively. Cmax increased by 42%, 34%, and 15% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . The half-life was unchanged in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The AUC 0-96h of Azure B after a single 1 mg/kg dose increased by 29%, 94%, and 339% in subjects with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60 – 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), and severe (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.732m 2 ) renal impairment, respectively. Cmax increased by 23%, 13%, and 65% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] Drug Interactions Studies Clinical Studies: The coadministration of 2 mg/kg dose of PROVAYBLUE ® with midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate), caffeine (a CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate), and dextromethorphan (a CYP2D6 substrate) in a cocktail study did not affect the exposure of these substrates compared to their exposure without PROVAYBLUE ® administration. In Vitro Studies: Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) Enzymes : Methylene blue inhibits CYP isozymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5. Possible time-dependent inhibition of CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 (testosterone as substrate) was also observed. Methylene blue induces CYP1A2 but does not induce CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): Methylene blue inhibits UGT1A9 and UGT1A4, but did not significantly inhibit UGTs 1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 2B7 or 2B15. Transporter: Methylene blue is both a substrate for and an inhibitor of P-gp but is not a substrate for BCRP or OCT2 in vitro. Methylene blue is not a significant inhibitor of BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OAT1B1 or OAT1B3. Methylene blue inhibits OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K."

The 6 patients included 3 males and 3 females of median age 54 years (range, 6 days to 69 years). The median methemoglobin level at baseline was 37% (range, 11% to 47%). All 6 (100%) patients had a decrease in methemoglobin by at least 50% within 1 hour after treatment. An additional 41 cases of treatment of methemoglobinemia with a methylene blue class product were identified in the published literature. These cases included 24 males and 17 females of median age 33 years (range, 9 days to 80 years). The median methemoglobin level at baseline was 40% (range, 10% to 98%). Of these 41 patients, 37 (90%) had a methemoglobin decrease of at least 50% within 1 hour after intravenous administration of the methylene blue class product.
