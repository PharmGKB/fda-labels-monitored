Table 3: Recommended Dosage Modifications for BRAFTOVI for Adverse Reactions Severity of Adverse Reaction National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. Dose Modification for BRAFTOVI New Primary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Non-Cutaneous RAS Mutation-positive Malignancies Permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • Symptomatic congestive heart failure or absolute decrease in LVEF of greater than 20% from baseline that is also below LLN Reduce BRAFTOVI by one dose level [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . • If LVEF improves to at least institutional LLN and absolute decrease to less than or equal to 10% compared to baseline, continue BRAFTOVI at the reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . • If no improvement, withhold BRAFTOVI until improves to at least institutional LLN and absolute decrease to less than or equal to 10% compared to baseline and then resume at the reduced dose or reduce dose an additional dose level. Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Grade 2 AST or ALT increased Maintain BRAFTOVI dose. • If no improvement within 4 weeks, withhold BRAFTOVI until improves to Grade 0-1 or to pretreatment/baseline levels and then resume at same dose. • Grade 3 or 4 AST or ALT increased See Other Adverse Reactions . Uveitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] • Grade 1–3 If Grade 1 or 2 does not respond to specific ocular therapy, or for Grade 3 uveitis, withhold BRAFTOVI for up to 6 weeks. • If improved, resume at same or reduced dose. • If not improved, permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. • Grade 4 Permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. QTc Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] • QTcF greater than 500 ms and less than or equal to 60 ms increase from baseline Withhold BRAFTOVI until QTcF less than or equal to 500 ms.

Resume at same dose. • Grade 3 Withhold BRAFTOVI until Grade 0–1. Resume at same dose if first occurrence or reduce dose if recurrent. • Grade 4 Permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. Other Adverse Reactions (including Hemorrhage) [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] and HFSR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Dose modification of BRAFTOVI when administered with binimetinib or with cetuximab is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies; ocular events other than uveitis, iritis, and iridocyclitis; interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis; creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation; rhabdomyolysis; and venous thromboembolism. • Recurrent Grade 2 or • First occurrence of any Grade 3 Withhold BRAFTOVI for up to 4 weeks. • If improves to Grade 0–1 or to pretreatment/baseline level, resume at reduced dose. • If no improvement, permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. • First occurrence of any Grade 4 Permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI or Withhold BRAFTOVI for up to 4 weeks. • If improves to Grade 0–1 or to pretreatment/baseline level, then resume at reduced dose. • If no improvement, permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. • Recurrent Grade 3 Consider permanently discontinuing BRAFTOVI. • Recurrent Grade 4 Permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. Refer to the binimetinib or cetuximab prescribing information for dose modifications for adverse reactions associated with each product, as appropriate. 2.6 Dose Modifications for Coadministration With Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the BRAFTOVI dose according to the recommendations in Table 4. After the inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, resume the BRAFTOVI dose that was taken prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 4: Recommended Dose Reductions for BRAFTOVI for Coadministration With Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Current Daily Dose Current daily dose refers to recommended dose of BRAFTOVI based on indication or reductions for adverse reactions based on dosing recommendations in Table 1 (Melanoma) and Table 2 (CRC). Dose for Coadministration with Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor Dose for Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor 450 mg 225 mg (three 75 mg capsules) 150 mg (two 75 mg capsules) 300 mg 150 mg (two 75 mg capsules) 75 mg 225 mg 75 mg 75 mg 150 mg 75 mg 75 mg Encorafenib exposure at the 75 mg QD BRAFTOVI dosage when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is expected to be higher than at the 150 mg QD dosage in the absence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor and similar to exposure at the 225 mg QD dosage in the absence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions and use clinical judgement when using BRAFTOVI with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at the 150 mg dose level."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • New Primary Malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous: Can occur. Monitor for malignancies and perform dermatologic evaluations prior to, while on therapy, and following discontinuation of treatment. ( 5.1 ) • Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors: Increased cell proliferation can occur with BRAF inhibitors. ( 5.2 ) • Cardiomyopathy: Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before initiating treatment with BRAFTOVI and binimetinib, and after one month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter. The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib has not been established in patients with LVEF below 50%. ( 5.3 ) • Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment with BRAFTOVI and binimetinib and as clinically indicated. ( 5.4 ) • Hemorrhage: Major hemorrhagic events can occur in patients receiving BRAFTOVI and binimetinib. ( 5.5 ) • Uveitis: Perform ophthalmologic evaluation at regular intervals and for any visual disturbances. ( 5.6 ) • QT Prolongation: Monitor electrolytes before and during treatment. Correct electrolyte abnormalities and control for cardiac risk factors for QT prolongation. Withhold BRAFTOVI for QTc of 500 ms or greater. ( 5.7 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females with reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus and to use effective non-hormonal method of contraception. ( 5.8 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) • Risks Associated with BRAFTOVI as a Single Agent: If binimetinib is temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued, reduce the dose of BRAFTOVI as recommended. ( 5.9 ) • Risks Associated with Combination Treatment: BRAFTOVI is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with binimetinib or cetuximab. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 New Primary Malignancies New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, have been observed in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors and can occur with BRAFTOVI. Cutaneous Malignancies In COLUMBUS, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), including keratoacanthoma (KA), occurred in 2.6%, and basal cell carcinoma occurred in 1.6% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Median time to first occurrence of cuSCC/KA was 5.8 months (range 1 to 9 months) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . For patients who received BRAFTOVI as a single agent, cuSCC/KA was reported in 8%, basal cell carcinoma in 1%, and a new primary melanoma in 5% of patients. In BEACON CRC, cuSCC/KA occurred in 1.4% of patients with CRC, and a new primary melanoma occurred in 1.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab. In PHAROS, cuSCC and skin papilloma, each occurred in 2% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies. Non-Cutaneous Malignancies Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . 5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells, which are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation prior to initiating BRAFTOVI [see Indications and Usage (1) , Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . 5.3 Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy, manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, evidence of cardiomyopathy (decreased in LVEF below the institutional LLN with an absolute decreased in LVEF ≥10% below baseline as detected by echocardiography or MUGA) occurred in 7% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib. Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1.6% of patients. The median time to first occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction (any grade) in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 3.6 months (range 0 to 21 months). Cardiomyopathy resolved in 87% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib. In PHAROS, evidence of cardiomyopathy (decrease in LVEF below the institutional LLN with an absolute decrease in LVEF ≥10% below baseline as detected by echocardiography or MUGA) occurred in 11% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1% of patients. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 82% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib. Assess ejection fraction by echocardiogram or MUGA scan prior to initiating treatment, one month after initiating treatment, and every 2 to 3 months during treatment. The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib has not been established in patients with baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN). Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely when treated with BRAFTOVI. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity can occur when BRAFTOVI is administered in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 6% for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 2.6% for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 0.5% for alkaline phosphatase. In PHAROS, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 10% for AST, 9% for ALT, and 3.2% for alkaline phosphatase. Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of BRAFTOVI, monthly during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.5 Hemorrhage In COLUMBUS, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; Grade 3 or greater hemorrhage occurred in 3.2% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were gastrointestinal, including rectal hemorrhage (4.2%), hematochezia (3.1%), and hemorrhoidal hemorrhage (1%). Fatal intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of new or progressive brain metastases occurred in 1.6% of patients. In BEACON CRC, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage occurred in 1.9% of patients, including fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 0.5% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (6.9%), hematochezia (2.3%), and rectal hemorrhage (2.3%). In PHAROS, hemorrhage occurred in 12% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib including fatal hemorrhage intracranial (1%); Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 4.1% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were anal hemorrhage and hemothorax (2% each). Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.6 Uveitis Uveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, the incidence of uveitis among patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 4%. In PHAROS, the incidence of uveitis among patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 1%. Assess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform an ophthalmologic evaluation at regular intervals and for new or worsening visual disturbances, and to follow new or persistent ophthalmologic findings. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.7 QT Prolongation BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . In COLUMBUS, an increase in QTcF to >500 ms was measured in 0.5% (1/192) of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In PHAROS, an increase in QTcF to >500 ms was measured in 2.1% (2/95) of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue for QTc >500 ms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Encorafenib produced embryo-fetal developmental changes in rats and rabbits and was an abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 26 (in the rat) and 178 (in the rabbit) times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 450 mg, with no clear findings at lower doses. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective, non-hormonal method of contraception since BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of BRAFTOVI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5.9 Risks Associated with BRAFTOVI as a Single Agent BRAFTOVI when used as a single agent is associated with an increased risk of certain adverse reactions compared to when BRAFTOVI is used in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, Grades 3 or 4 dermatologic reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with BRAFTOVI single agent compared to 2% of patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . If binimetinib is temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued, reduce the dose of BRAFTOVI as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . 5.10 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment BRAFTOVI is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with binimetinib or cetuximab. Refer to the prescribing information for binimetinib and cetuximab for additional risk information."

BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib is described in 192 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received BRAFTOVI (450 mg once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg twice daily) in a randomized open-label, active-controlled trial (COLUMBUS). The COLUMBUS trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] excluded patients with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc (>480 ms), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 11.8 months for patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib and 6.2 months for patients treated with vemurafenib. The most common (≥25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were nausea (7%), vomiting (7%), and pyrexia (4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 14% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were arthralgia (2%), fatigue (2%), and nausea (2%). Five percent (5%) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI; the most common were hemorrhage in 2% and headache in 1% of patients. Table 5 and Table 6 present adverse drug reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, identified in COLUMBUS. The COLUMBUS trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, as compared to vemurafenib, for any specific adverse reaction listed in Table 5.

The BEACON CRC trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] excluded patients with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc (>480 ms), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 4.4 months for patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and 1.6 months for patients treated with either irinotecan or infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/folinic acid (FA)/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in combination with cetuximab. The most common (≥25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, dermatitis acneiform, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, arthralgia, and rash. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 33% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; the most common were vomiting (4%), fatigue (4%), nausea (4%), pyrexia (3%), and diarrhea (3%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 9% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; the most common were fatigue (2%), arthralgia (2%), and peripheral neuropathy (2%). Ten percent (10%) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI. None of the adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI occurred in more than one patient (>0.5%).

( 7.1 ) • Sensitive CYP3A4 substrates: Avoid coadministration with CYP3A4 substrates (including hormonal contraceptives) for which a decrease in plasma concentration may lead to reduced efficacy of the substrate. ( 7.2 ) • Transporters: Dose reductions of drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP may be required when used concomitantly with BRAFTOVI. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on BRAFTOVI Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of BRAFTOVI with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor increases encorafenib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] and may increase encorafenib adverse reactions. Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the BRAFTOVI dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of BRAFTOVI with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease encorafenib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] and may decrease encorafenib efficacy. Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong CYP3A4 inducers. 7.2 Effect of BRAFTOVI on Other Drugs Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates BRAFTOVI is a strong CYP3A4 inducer at steady-state. Concomitant use of BRAFTOVI may decrease the plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (including hormonal contraceptives), [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid the coadministration of BRAFTOVI with CYP3A4 substrates for which a decrease in plasma concentration may lead to reduced efficacy of the substrate. If the coadministration cannot be avoided, see the CYP3A4 substrate product labeling for recommendations. OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP Substrates Coadministration of BRAFTOVI with OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP substrates can result in increased concentrations of the substrates, and may increase toxicity of these agents. When used in combination, monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposure and consider adjusting the dose of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] .

( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no available clinical data on the use of BRAFTOVI during pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, encorafenib produced embryo-fetal developmental changes in rats and rabbits and was an abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 26 (in the rat) and 178 (in the rabbit) times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 450 mg, with no clear findings at lower doses (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicity studies, administration of encorafenib to rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal weights, and increased incidence of total skeletal variations at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 26 times the human exposure based on area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] at the recommended clinical dose of 450 mg once daily). In pregnant rabbits, administration of encorafenib during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, decreased fetal body weights, increased incidence of total skeletal variations and increased post-implantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 178 times the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 450 mg once daily). While formal placental transfer studies have not been performed, encorafenib exposure in the fetal plasma of both rats and rabbits was up to 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively, of maternal exposure. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of encorafenib or its metabolites in human milk or the effects of encorafenib on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from BRAFTOVI, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating BRAFTOVI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the last dose. Counsel patients to use a non-hormonal method of contraception since BRAFTOVI has the potential to render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Infertility Males Based on findings in male rats at doses approximately 13 times the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose, use of BRAFTOVI may impact fertility in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of BRAFTOVI have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 690 patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib across multiple clinical trials, 20% were aged 65 to 74 years and 8% were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Of the 216 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic CRC who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab, 62 (29%) were 65 years of age to up to 75 years of age, while 20 (9%) were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] .

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Encorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF V600E, as well as wild-type BRAF and CRAF in in vitro cell-free assays with IC 50 values of 0.35, 0.47, and 0.3 nM, respectively. Mutations in the BRAF gene, such as BRAF V600E, can result in constitutively activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth. Encorafenib was also able to bind to other kinases in vitro including JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, LIMK1, LIMK2, MEK4, and STK36 and reduce ligand binding to these kinases at clinically achievable concentrations (≤0.9 µM). Encorafenib inhibited in vitro growth of tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600 E, D, and K mutations. In mice implanted with tumor cells expressing BRAF V600E , encorafenib induced tumor regressions associated with RAF/MEK/ERK pathway suppression. Encorafenib and binimetinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared with either drug alone, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive cell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Additionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone. In a BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model in mice, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to binimetinib alone, with respect to tumor growth inhibition. Increased tumor growth delay after dosing cessation was also observed with the coadmnistration compared to either drug alone. In the setting of BRAF-mutant CRC, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway activation has been identified as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Combinations of a BRAF inhibitor and agents targeting EGFR have been shown to overcome this resistance mechanism in nonclinical models. Coadministration of encorafenib and cetuximab had an anti-tumor effect greater than either drug alone, in a mouse model of colorectal cancer with mutated BRAF V600E. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology A dedicated study to evaluate the QT prolongation potential of BRAFTOVI has not been conducted. BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation. Based on a central tendency analysis of QTc in a study of adult patients with melanoma who received the recommended dose of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, the largest mean (90% CI) QTcF change from baseline (ΔQTcF) was 18 (14 to 22) ms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumors, including advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma harboring a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic CRC. After a single dose, systemic exposure of encorafenib was dose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 700 mg (0.1 to 1.6 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg). After once-daily dosing, systemic exposure of encorafenib was less than dose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 800 mg (0.1 to 1.8 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg). Steady-state was reached within 15 days, with exposure being 50% lower compared to Day 1; intersubject variability (CV%) of AUC ranged from 12% to 69%. Absorption The median T max of encorafenib is 2 hours. At least 86% of the dose is absorbed. Effect of Food Following administration of a single dose of BRAFTOVI 100 mg (0.2 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg) with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (consisting of approximately 150 calories from protein, 350 calories from carbohydrates, and 500 calories from fat) the mean maximum encorafenib concentration (C max ) decreased by 36% and there was no effect on AUC. Distribution The geometric mean (CV%) of apparent volume of distribution is 164 L (70%). The protein binding of encorafenib is 86% in vitro. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.58. Elimination The mean (CV%) terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) of encorafenib is 3.5 hours (17%), and the apparent clearance is 14 L/h (54%) at day 1, increasing to 32 L/h (59%) at steady-state at the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg. Metabolism Encorafenib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 (83%) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 (16%) and CYP2D6 (1%). Excretion Following a single radiolabeled dose of 100 mg encorafenib, 47% (5% unchanged) of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 47% (2% unchanged) in urine. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were observed based on age (19 to 94 years), sex, body weight (34 to 168 kg), mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), and mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to <90 mL/min). The effect of race or ethnicity, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), and severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) on encorafenib pharmacokinetics have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Coadministration of posaconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) or diltiazem (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased AUC of encorafenib by 3- and 2-fold, respectively, and increased C max by 68% and 45%, respectively, after a single dose of 50 mg BRAFTOVI (0.1 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg). Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: The effect of a strong CYP3A4 inducer on encorafenib exposure has not been studied [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with modafinil, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, decreased encorafenib steady-state AUC by 24% and C max by 20%, compared to BRAFTOVI alone. Effect of encorafenib on CYP3A4 Substrates: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a single dose of midazolam 2 mg, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, decreased midazolam AUC by 82% and C max by 74% relative to midazolam 2 mg alone. Effect of encorafenib on Other CYP Substrates: There was no clinically significant effect of repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily on the exposure of substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Proton Pump Inhibitors: No clinically significant differences in encorafenib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with rabeprazole. Binimetinib: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of binimetinib (UGT1A1 substrate) were observed when coadministered with BRAFTOVI (UGT1A1 inhibitor). Cetuximab: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib or cetuximab were observed when the recommended BRAFTOVI dose of 300 mg was coadministered with cetuximab. Transporters: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a single dose of rosuvastatin (a sensitive substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP) increased rosuvastatin C max by 2.7-fold and AUC by 1.6-fold . In Vitro Studies CYP/UGT Enzymes: Encorafenib is a reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1. Transporters: Encorafenib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) but not of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) or organic cation transporter (OCT1) at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Encorafenib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OCT2, organic anion transporter (OAT1, OAT3), OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not of OCT1 or MRP2 at clinically relevant plasma concentrations."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Encorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF V600E, as well as wild-type BRAF and CRAF in in vitro cell-free assays with IC 50 values of 0.35, 0.47, and 0.3 nM, respectively. Mutations in the BRAF gene, such as BRAF V600E, can result in constitutively activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth. Encorafenib was also able to bind to other kinases in vitro including JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, LIMK1, LIMK2, MEK4, and STK36 and reduce ligand binding to these kinases at clinically achievable concentrations (≤0.9 µM). Encorafenib inhibited in vitro growth of tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600 E, D, and K mutations. In mice implanted with tumor cells expressing BRAF V600E , encorafenib induced tumor regressions associated with RAF/MEK/ERK pathway suppression. Encorafenib and binimetinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared with either drug alone, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive cell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Additionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone. In a BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model in mice, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to binimetinib alone, with respect to tumor growth inhibition. Increased tumor growth delay after dosing cessation was also observed with the coadmnistration compared to either drug alone. In the setting of BRAF-mutant CRC, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway activation has been identified as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Combinations of a BRAF inhibitor and agents targeting EGFR have been shown to overcome this resistance mechanism in nonclinical models. Coadministration of encorafenib and cetuximab had an anti-tumor effect greater than either drug alone, in a mouse model of colorectal cancer with mutated BRAF V600E."

BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation. Based on a central tendency analysis of QTc in a study of adult patients with melanoma who received the recommended dose of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, the largest mean (90% CI) QTcF change from baseline (ΔQTcF) was 18 (14 to 22) ms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] ."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumors, including advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma harboring a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic CRC. After a single dose, systemic exposure of encorafenib was dose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 700 mg (0.1 to 1.6 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg). After once-daily dosing, systemic exposure of encorafenib was less than dose proportional over the dose range of 50 mg to 800 mg (0.1 to 1.8 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg). Steady-state was reached within 15 days, with exposure being 50% lower compared to Day 1; intersubject variability (CV%) of AUC ranged from 12% to 69%. Absorption The median T max of encorafenib is 2 hours. At least 86% of the dose is absorbed. Effect of Food Following administration of a single dose of BRAFTOVI 100 mg (0.2 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg) with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (consisting of approximately 150 calories from protein, 350 calories from carbohydrates, and 500 calories from fat) the mean maximum encorafenib concentration (C max ) decreased by 36% and there was no effect on AUC. Distribution The geometric mean (CV%) of apparent volume of distribution is 164 L (70%). The protein binding of encorafenib is 86% in vitro. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.58. Elimination The mean (CV%) terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) of encorafenib is 3.5 hours (17%), and the apparent clearance is 14 L/h (54%) at day 1, increasing to 32 L/h (59%) at steady-state at the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg. Metabolism Encorafenib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 (83%) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 (16%) and CYP2D6 (1%). Excretion Following a single radiolabeled dose of 100 mg encorafenib, 47% (5% unchanged) of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 47% (2% unchanged) in urine. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib were observed based on age (19 to 94 years), sex, body weight (34 to 168 kg), mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), and mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to <90 mL/min). The effect of race or ethnicity, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), and severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) on encorafenib pharmacokinetics have not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Coadministration of posaconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) or diltiazem (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased AUC of encorafenib by 3- and 2-fold, respectively, and increased C max by 68% and 45%, respectively, after a single dose of 50 mg BRAFTOVI (0.1 times the maximum recommended dose of 450 mg). Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: The effect of a strong CYP3A4 inducer on encorafenib exposure has not been studied [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with modafinil, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, decreased encorafenib steady-state AUC by 24% and C max by 20%, compared to BRAFTOVI alone. Effect of encorafenib on CYP3A4 Substrates: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a single dose of midazolam 2 mg, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, decreased midazolam AUC by 82% and C max by 74% relative to midazolam 2 mg alone. Effect of encorafenib on Other CYP Substrates: There was no clinically significant effect of repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily on the exposure of substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Proton Pump Inhibitors: No clinically significant differences in encorafenib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with rabeprazole. Binimetinib: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of binimetinib (UGT1A1 substrate) were observed when coadministered with BRAFTOVI (UGT1A1 inhibitor). Cetuximab: No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of encorafenib or cetuximab were observed when the recommended BRAFTOVI dose of 300 mg was coadministered with cetuximab. Transporters: Repeat dose administration of BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a single dose of rosuvastatin (a sensitive substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP) increased rosuvastatin C max by 2.7-fold and AUC by 1.6-fold .

Eligible patients were required to have BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, as detected using the bioMerieux THxID™BRAF assay. Patients were permitted to have received immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting and one prior line of immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was prohibited. Randomization was stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a or IVM1b, versus IVM1c), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 versus 1), and prior immunotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease (yes versus no). Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily in combination with binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib), BRAFTOVI 300 mg once daily, or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Only the results of the approved dosing (BRAFTOVI 450 mg in combination with binimetinib 45 mg) are described below. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by a blinded independent central review, to compare BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib with vemurafenib. Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall survival (OS), as well as objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) which were assessed by central review. A total of 577 patients were randomized, 192 to the BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib arm, 194 to the BRAFTOVI arm, and 191 to the vemurafenib arm. Of the 383 patients randomized to either the BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib or the vemurafenib arms, the median age was 56 years (20 to 89 years), 59% were male, 91% were White, and 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Ninety-five percent (95%) had metastatic disease, 65% were Stage IVM1c, and 4% received prior CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 directed antibodies. Twenty-eight percent (28%) had elevated baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 45% had ≥3 organs with tumor involvement at baseline, and 3% had brain metastases. Based on centralized testing, 100% of patients' tumors tested positive for BRAF mutations; BRAF V600E (88%), BRAF V600K (11%), or both (<1%). BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to vemurafenib. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 11 and Figure 1.

Eligible patients were required to have BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), as detected using the Qiagen therascreen BRAF V600E RGQ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Kit, with disease progression after 1 or 2 prior regimens. Other key eligibility criteria included absence of prior treatment with a RAF, MEK, or EGFR inhibitor, eligibility to receive cetuximab per local labeling with respect to tumor RAS status, and ECOG performance status (PS) 0–1. Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 versus 1), prior use of irinotecan (yes versus no), and cetuximab product used (US-licensed versus EU-approved). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment arms: • BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab (BRAFTOVI/cetuximab arm) • BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with binimetinib and cetuximab • Irinotecan with cetuximab or FOLFIRI with cetuximab (control arm) The dosage of cetuximab in all patients was 400 mg/m 2 intravenously for the first dose followed by 250 mg/m 2 weekly. Patients in the control arm received cetuximab with either irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle or FOLFIRI intravenously (irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 15; folinic acid 400 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 15; then fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 bolus on Days 1 and 15 followed by fluorouracil 2400 mg/m 2 /day by continuous infusion over 2 days). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Only the results of the approved regimen (BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab) are described below. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Additional efficacy outcome measures included progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DoR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). OS and PFS were assessed in all randomized patients. ORR and DoR were assessed in the subset of the first 220 patients included in the randomized portion of the BRAFTOVI/cetuximab and control arm of the study. A total of 220 patients were randomized to the BRAFTOVI/cetuximab arm and 221 to the control arm. Of these 441 patients, the median age was 61 years; 53% were female; 80% were White and 15% were Asian. Fifty percent (50%) had baseline ECOG performance status of 0; 66% received 1 prior therapy and 34% received 2; 93% received prior oxaliplatin and 52% received prior irinotecan. BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS, ORR, and PFS compared to the active comparator.

Eligible patients had a diagnosis of histologically-confirmed metastatic NSCLC with BRAF V600E mutation that was treatment-naïve or had been previously treated with 1 prior line of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting (platinum-based chemotherapy and/or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies), age 18 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, and measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors was not allowed. Patients received BRAFTOVI 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 and duration of response (DoR) as assessed by independent review committee (IRC). In the efficacy population, BRAF V600E mutation status was determined by prospective local testing using tumor tissue (78%) or blood (22%) specimens. Of the 98 patients with BRAF V600E mutation, 6 patients were enrolled into the trial based on testing of their tumor tissue specimens with the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. Of the remaining 92 patients enrolled based on local testing, 68 patients had their tumor tissue specimens retrospectively confirmed as having BRAF V600E positive status by the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. The remaining patients had either BRAF V600E negative status (n=5) or had unevaluable results (n=19) by the FoundationOne CDx tissue test. In addition, plasma samples from 81 out of 98 patients were retrospectively tested using the FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay. Of the 81 patients, 48 were confirmed positive for BRAF V600E, while 33 patients were BRAF V600E mutation negative by FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay. The remaining 17 samples had unevaluable results with FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay. The efficacy population included 59 treatment-naïve patients and 39 previously-treated patients. Among these 98 patients, the median age was 70 years (range: 47 to 86); 53% female; 88% White, 7% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 1% American Indian or Alaska Native; 99% were not Hispanic or Latino; 13% were current smokers and 57% were former smokers; 73% had ECOG PS of 1; and 97% had adenocarcinoma. All patients had metastatic disease, and 8% had brain metastases at baseline. Efficacy results for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC are summarized in Table 13.
