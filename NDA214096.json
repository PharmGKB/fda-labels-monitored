        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Select patients for treatment with TEPMETKO on the presence of MET ex14 skipping. ( 2.1 , 14 ) Recommended dosage : 450 mg orally once daily with food until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection for METex14 Skipping Alterations Select patients for treatment with TEPMETKO based on the presence of MET exon 14 skipping alterations in plasma or tumor specimens. Testing for the presence of MET exon 14 skipping alterations in plasma specimens is recommended only in patients for whom a tumor biopsy cannot be obtained. If an alteration is not detected in a plasma specimen, re-evaluate the feasibility of biopsy for tumor tissue testing. An FDA-approved test for detection of MET exon 14 skipping alterations in NSCLC for selecting patients for treatment with TEPMETKO is not available. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of TEPMETKO is 450 mg orally once daily with food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Instruct patients to take their dose of TEPMETKO at approximately the same time every day and to swallow tablets whole. Do not chew, crush or split tablets. Advise patients not to make up a missed dose within 8 hours of the next scheduled dose. If vomiting occurs after taking a dose of TEPMETKO, advise patients to take the next dose at the scheduled time. 2.3 Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dose reduction of TEPMETKO for the management of adverse reactions is 225 mg orally once daily. Permanently discontinue TEPMETKO in patients who are unable to tolerate 225 mg orally once daily. The recommended dosage modifications of TEPMETKO for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Recommended TEPMETKO Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction Severity Dose Modification Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) /Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Any grade Withhold TEPMETKO if ILD is suspected.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis : Immediately withhold TEPMETKO in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue TEPMETKO in patients diagnosed with ILD/pneumonitis of any severity. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests. Withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TEPMETKO based on severity. ( 5.2 ) Embryo-fetal toxicity : TEPMETKO can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis ILD/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, occurred in patients treated with TEPMETKO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 2.2% patients treated with TEPMETKO, with one patient experiencing a Grade 3 or higher event; this event resulted in death. Four patients (0.9%) discontinued TEPMETKO due to ILD/pneumonitis. Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold TEPMETKO in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with TEPMETKO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 13% of patients treated with TEPMETKO. Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT/AST occurred in 4.2% of patients. A fatal adverse reaction of hepatic failure occurred in one patient (0.2%). Three patients (0.7%) discontinued TEPMETKO due to increased ALT/AST. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher increased ALT/AST was 30 days (range 1 to 178). Monitor liver function tests (including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of TEPMETKO, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop increased transaminases or bilirubin. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TEPMETKO [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action TEPMETKO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Oral administration of tepotinib to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations (teratogenicity) and anomalies at exposures less than the human exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the 450 mg daily clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential or males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TEPMETKO and for one week after the final dose.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling: Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were edema, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, and dyspnea. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥ 2%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased albumin, decreased sodium, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, increased amylase, increased ALT, increased AST, and decreased hemoglobin. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact EMD Serono at 1-800-283-8088 ext. 5563 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to TEPMETKO in 448 patients with solid tumors enrolled in five open-label, single-arm studies receiving TEPMETKO as single agent at a dose of 450 mg once daily. This included 255 patients with NSCLC positive for MET ex14 skipping alterations, who received TEPMETKO in VISION. Among 448 patients who received TEPMETKO, 32% were exposed for 6 months or longer, and 12% were exposed for greater than one year. The data described below reflect exposure to TEPMETKO 450 mg once daily in 255 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with MET ex14 skipping alterations in VISION [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients who received TEPMETKO. Serious adverse reactions in > 2% of patients included pleural effusion (7%), pneumonia (5%), edema (3.9%), dyspnea (3.9%), general health deterioration (3.5%), pulmonary embolism (2%), and musculoskeletal pain (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in one patient (0.4%) due to pneumonitis, one patient (0.4%) due to hepatic failure, and one patient (0.4%) due to dyspnea from fluid overload. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 20% of patients who received TEPMETKO. The most frequent adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to permanent discontinuations of TEPMETKO were edema (5%), pleural effusion (2%), dyspnea (1.6%), general health deterioration (1.6%), and pneumonitis (1.2%). Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 44% of patients who received TEPMETKO. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in > 2% of patients who received TEPMETKO included edema (23%), increased blood creatinine (6%), pleural effusion (4.3%), increased ALT (3.1%), and pneumonia (2.4%). Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 30% of patients who received TEPMETKO. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in > 2% of patients who received TEPMETKO included edema (19%), pleural effusion (2.7%), and increased blood creatinine (2.7%). The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients who received TEPMETKO were edema, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, and dyspnea. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥ 2%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased albumin, decreased sodium, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, increased amylase, increased ALT, increased AST, and decreased hemoglobin.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ], TEPMETKO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of TEPMETKO in pregnant women. Oral administration of tepotinib to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations (teratogenicity) and anomalies at maternal exposures less than the human exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the 450 mg daily clinical dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rabbits received oral doses of 0.5, 5, 25, 50, 150, or 450 mg/kg tepotinib hydrochloride hydrate daily during organogenesis. Severe maternal toxicity occurred at the 450 mg/kg dose (approximately 0.75 times the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose). At 150 mg/kg (approximately 0.5 times the human exposure by AUC at the 450 mg clinical dose), two animals aborted and one animal died prematurely; mean fetal body weight was also decreased. A dose-dependent increase of skeletal malformations, including malrotations of fore and/or hind paws with concomitant misshapen scapula and/or malpositioned clavicle and/or calcaneous and/or talus, occurred at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.003 times the human exposure by AUC at the 450 mg clinical dose); there was also an incidence of spina bifida at the 5 mg/kg dose level. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the secretion of tepotinib or its metabolites in human milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TEPMETKO and for one week after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on animal data, TEPMETKO can cause malformations at doses less than the human exposure based on AUC at the 450 mg clinical dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TEPMETKO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ], TEPMETKO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of TEPMETKO in pregnant women. Oral administration of tepotinib to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations (teratogenicity) and anomalies at maternal exposures less than the human exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the 450 mg daily clinical dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, pregnant rabbits received oral doses of 0.5, 5, 25, 50, 150, or 450 mg/kg tepotinib hydrochloride hydrate daily during organogenesis. Severe maternal toxicity occurred at the 450 mg/kg dose (approximately 0.75 times the human exposure at the 450 mg clinical dose). At 150 mg/kg (approximately 0.5 times the human exposure by AUC at the 450 mg clinical dose), two animals aborted and one animal died prematurely; mean fetal body weight was also decreased. A dose-dependent increase of skeletal malformations, including malrotations of fore and/or hind paws with concomitant misshapen scapula and/or malpositioned clavicle and/or calcaneous and/or talus, occurred at doses ≥ 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.003 times the human exposure by AUC at the 450 mg clinical dose); there was also an incidence of spina bifida at the 5 mg/kg dose level."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tepotinib is a kinase inhibitor that targets MET, including variants with exon 14 skipping alterations. Tepotinib inhibits hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent and -independent MET phosphorylation and MET-dependent downstream signaling pathways. Tepotinib also inhibited melatonin 2 and imidazoline 1 receptors at clinically achievable concentrations. In vitro, tepotinib inhibited tumor cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and migration of MET-dependent tumor cells. In mice implanted with tumor cell lines with oncogenic activation of MET, including MET ex14 skipping alterations, tepotinib inhibited tumor growth, led to sustained inhibition of MET phosphorylation, and, in one model, decreased the formation of metastases. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Tepotinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response have not been fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology At the recommended dosage, no large mean increases in QTc (i.e. > 20 ms) were detected in patients with various solid tumors. A concentration-dependent increase in QTc interval was observed. The QTc effect of tepotinib at high clinical exposures has not been evaluated. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of tepotinib were evaluated in patients with cancer administered 450 mg once daily unless otherwise specified. Tepotinib exposure (AUC 0-12h and C max ) increases dose-proportionally over the dose range of 27 mg (0.06 times the recommended daily dosage) to 450 mg. At the recommended dosage, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation [CV] %) steady state C max was 1,291 ng/mL (48.1%) and the AUC 0-24h was 27,438 ng∙h/mL (51.7%). The oral clearance of tepotinib did not change with respect to time. The median accumulation was 2.5-fold for C max and 3.3-fold for AUC 0-24h after multiple daily doses of tepotinib. Absorption The median T max of tepotinib is 8 hours (range from 6 to 12 hours). The geometric mean (CV%) absolute bioavailability of TEPMETKO in the fed state was 71.6% (10.8%) in healthy subjects. Effect of Food The mean AUC 0-INF of tepotinib increased by 1.6-fold and C max increased by 2-fold, following administration of a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 800 to 1,000 calories, 150 calories from protein, 250 calories from carbohydrate, and 500 to 600 calories from fat). The median T max shifted from 12 hours to 8 hours. Distribution The geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution (V Z /F) of tepotinib is 1,038 L (24.3%). Protein binding of tepotinib is 98% and is independent of drug concentration at clinically relevant exposures. Elimination The apparent clearance (CL/F) of tepotinib is 23.8 L/h (87.5%) and the half-life is 32 hours following oral administration of TEPMETKO in patients with cancer. Metabolism Tepotinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. One major circulating plasma metabolite (M506) has been identified. Excretion Following a single oral administration of a radiolabeled dose of 450 mg tepotinib, approximately 85% of the dose was recovered in feces (45% unchanged) and 13.6% in urine (7% unchanged). The major circulating metabolite M506 accounted for about 40.4% of the total radioactivity in plasma. Specific Populations No clinically significant effects on tepotinib pharmacokinetics were observed based on age (18 to 89 years), race/ethnicity (White, Black, Asian, Japanese, and Hispanic), sex, body weight (35.5 to 136 kg), mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min), or mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B). The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) on the pharmacokinetics of tepotinib has not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches P-gp Substrates: Coadministration of TEPMETKO with dabigatran etexilate (P-gp substrate) increased dabigatran C max by 40% and AUC 0-INF by 50%. Acid-Reducing Agents : No clinically significant differences in tepotinib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with multiple daily doses (40 mg daily for 5 days) of omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor) under fed conditions. CYP3A Substrates: Coadministration of TEPMETKO had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A substrate). MATE2 and OCT2 Substrates: No clinically relevant differences in glucose levels were observed when metformin (MATE2 and OCT2 substrate) was coadministered with tepotinib. CYP2C9 Substrates: Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling suggested CYP2C9 inhibition is not clinically significant. In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: Tepotinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. Tepotinib and M506 do not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1, and do not induce CYP1A2 or 2B6 at clinically relevant concentrations. UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT ): Tepotinib and M506 do not inhibit UGT 1A1, 1A9, 2B17, 1A3/4/6 and 2B7/15 at clinically relevant concentrations. Transporter Systems : Tepotinib is a P-gp substrate. Tepotinib may inhibit intestinal BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations. Tepotinib does not inhibit bile salt export pump (BSEP), organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, B3, or organic anion transporter (OAT)1 and 3."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of TEPMETKO was evaluated in a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, multicohort study (VISION, NCT02864992). Eligible patients were required to have advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring MET ex14 skipping alterations, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) negative status, at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1. Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases, clinically significant uncontrolled cardiac disease, or who received treatment with any MET or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibitor were not eligible for the study. Identification of MET ex14 skipping alterations was prospectively determined using central laboratories employing either a PCR-based or next-generation sequencing-based clinical trial assay using tissue (58%) and/or plasma (65%) samples. Patients received TEPMETKO 450 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed overall response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated by a Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC). An additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR) by BIRC. The efficacy population included 69 treatment naïve patients and 83 previously treated patients. The median age was 73 years (range 41 to 94 years); 48% female; 71% White, 25% Asian; 27% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0 and 73% had ECOG PS 1; 43% never smoked; 86% had adenocarcinoma; 98% had metastatic disease; and 10% had CNS metastases. Amongst previously treated patients, 89% received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Efficacy results are presented in Table 4.
