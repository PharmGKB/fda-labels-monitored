        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Adult patients with newly-diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ CML: 400 mg orally once daily with food. ( 2.1 ) • Adult patients with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy: 500 mg orally once daily with food. ( 2.1 ) • Pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ CML: 300 mg/m 2 orally once daily with food. ( 2.1 ) • Pediatric patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy: 400 mg/m 2 orally once daily with food. ( 2.1 ) • Consider dose escalation by increments of 100 mg once daily to a maximum of 600 mg daily in adult patients who do not reach complete hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular response and do not have Grade 3 or greater adverse reactions. ( 2.2 ) • Consider dose escalation by increments of 50 mg for those with a BSA <1.1 m 2 and 100 mg for those with a BSA ≥1.1 m 2 to a maximum of 600 mg daily in pediatric patients who do not reach sufficient response after 3 months. ( 2.2 ) • Adjust dosage for toxicity and organ impairment ( 2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage is taken orally once daily with food. Swallow tablets whole. Do not cut, crush, break or chew tablets. Continue treatment with BOSULIF until disease progression or intolerance to therapy. Capsules may be swallowed whole. For patients who are unable to swallow a whole capsule(s), each capsule can be opened and the contents mixed with applesauce or yogurt. Mixing the capsule contents with applesauce or yogurt cannot be considered a substitute of a proper meal. If a dose is missed beyond 12 hours, the patient should skip the dose and take the usual prescribed dose on the following day. Dosage in Adult Patients with Newly-Diagnosed CP Ph+ CML The recommended dosage of BOSULIF is 400 mg orally once daily with food. Dosage in Adult Patients with CP, AP, or BP Ph+ CML with Resistance or Intolerance to Prior Therapy The recommended dosage of BOSULIF is 500 mg orally once daily with food. Dosage in Pediatric Patients with Newly-Diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or with CP Ph+ CML with Resistance or Intolerance to Prior Therapy The recommended dose of BOSULIF for pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML is 300 mg/m 2 orally once daily with food and the recommended dosage for pediatric patients with CP Ph+ CML that is resistant or intolerant to prior therapy is 400 mg/m 2 orally once daily with food and dose recommendations are provided in Table 1. As appropriate, the desired dose can be attained by combining different strengths of BOSULIF tablets or capsules. Table 1: Dosing of BOSULIF for Pediatric Patients with Newly-Diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or with CP Ph+ CML with Resistance or Intolerance to Prior Therapy BSA BSA=Body Surface Area Newly-Diagnosed Recommended Dose (Once Daily) Resistant or Intolerant Recommended Dose (Once Daily) < 0.55 m 2 150 mg 200 mg 0.55 to < 0.63 m 2 200 mg 250 mg 0.63 to < 0.75 m 2 200 mg 300 mg 0.75 to < 0.9 m 2 250 mg 350 mg 0.9 to < 1.1 m 2 300 mg 400 mg ≥ 1.1 m 2 400 mg maximum starting dose (corresponding to maximum starting dose in adult indication) 500 mg Preparation Instructions for BOSULIF Capsules Mixed with Applesauce or Yogurt For patients who are unable to swallow capsules, the contents of the capsules can be mixed with applesauce or yogurt. Remove the required number of capsules from the container to prepare the dose as instructed and the amount of either room temperature applesauce or yogurt in a clean container. Carefully open each capsule, add the entire capsule content of each capsule into the applesauce or yogurt, then mix the entire dose into the applesauce or yogurt. Patients should immediately consume the full mixture in its entirety, without chewing. Do not store the mixture for later use. If the entire preparation is not swallowed do not take an additional dose. Wait until the next day to resume dosing. Table 2: BOSULIF Dose Using Capsules and Soft Food Volumes Dose Volume of Applesauce or Yogurt 100 mg 10 mL (2 teaspoons) 150 mg 15 mL (3 teaspoons) 200 mg 20 mL (4 teaspoons) 250 mg 25 mL (5 teaspoons) 300 mg 30 mL (6 teaspoons) 350 mg 30 mL (6 teaspoons) 400 mg 35 mL (7 teaspoons) 450 mg 40 mL (8 teaspoons) 500 mg 45 mL (9 teaspoons) 550 mg 45 mL (9 teaspoons) 600 mg 50 mL (10 teaspoons) 2.2 Dose Escalation In clinical studies of adult patients with Ph+ CML, dose escalation by increments of 100 mg once daily to a maximum of 600 mg once daily was allowed in patients who did not achieve or maintain a hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular response and who did not have Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions at the recommended starting dosage. In pediatric patients with BSA <1.1 m 2 and an insufficient response after 3 months consider increasing dose by 50 mg increments up to maximum of 100 mg above starting dose. Dose increases for insufficient response in pediatric patients with BSA ≥1.1 m 2 can be conducted similarly to adult recommendations in 100 mg increments. The maximum dose in pediatric and adult patients is 600 mg once daily. 2.3 Dosage Adjustments for Non-Hematologic Adverse Reactions Elevated liver transaminases: If elevations in liver transaminases greater than 5×institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) occur, withhold BOSULIF until recovery to less than or equal to 2.5×ULN and resume at 400 mg once daily thereafter. If recovery takes longer than 4 weeks, discontinue BOSULIF. If transaminase elevations greater than or equal to 3×ULN occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations greater than 2×ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2×ULN (Hy's law case definition), discontinue BOSULIF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Diarrhea: For National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Grade 3–4 diarrhea (increase of greater than or equal to 7 stools/day over baseline/pretreatment), withhold BOSULIF until recovery to Grade less than or equal to 1. BOSULIF may be resumed at 400 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For other clinically significant, moderate or severe non-hematological toxicity, withhold BOSULIF until the toxicity has resolved, then consider resuming BOSULIF at a dose reduced by 100 mg taken once daily. If clinically appropriate, consider re-escalating the dose of BOSULIF to the starting dose taken once daily. In pediatric patients, dose adjustments for non-hematologic toxicities can be conducted similarly to adults, however the dose reduction increments may differ. For pediatric patients with BSA <1.1 m 2 , reduce dose by 50 mg initially followed by additional 50 mg increment if the adverse reaction (AR) persists. For pediatric patients with BSA ≥1.1 m 2 or greater, reduce dose similarly to adults. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments for Myelosuppression Dose reductions for severe or persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are described below (Table 3). Table 3: Dose Adjustments for Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia in Adult and Pediatric Patients ANC Absolute Neutrophil Count less than 1000×10 6 /L or Platelets less than 50,000×10 6 /L Withhold BOSULIF until ANC greater than or equal to1000×10 6 /L and platelets greater than or equal to 50,000×10 6 /L. Resume treatment with BOSULIF at the same dose if recovery occurs within 2 weeks. If blood counts remain low for greater than 2 weeks, upon recovery, reduce dose by 100 mg and resume treatment, or by 50 mg in pediatric patients with BSA <1.1 m 2 and resume treatment. If cytopenia recurs, reduce dose by an additional 100 mg upon recovery and resume treatment, or by an additional 50 mg in pediatric patients with BSA <1.1 m 2 and resume treatment. 2.5 Dosage Adjustments for Renal Impairment or Hepatic Impairment The recommended starting doses for patients with renal and hepatic impairment are described in Table 4 below.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Monitor and manage as necessary. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) • Myelosuppression: Monitor blood counts and manage as necessary. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) • Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor liver enzymes at least monthly for the first 3 months and as needed. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 2.3 , 5.3 ) • Cardiovascular Toxicity: Monitor and manage as necessary. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 5.4 ) • Fluid Retention: Monitor patients and manage using standard of care treatment. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 2.3 , 5.5 ) • Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients for renal function at baseline and during therapy with BOSULIF. ( 5.6 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: BOSULIF can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Toxicity Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occur with BOSULIF treatment. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and fluid replacement. In the randomized clinical trial in adult patients with newly-diagnosed Ph+ CML, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 4 days and the median duration per event was 3 days. Among 546 adult patients in a single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 2 days and the median duration per event was 2 days. Among the patients who experienced diarrhea, the median number of episodes of diarrhea per patient during treatment with BOSULIF was 3 (range 1–268). Among 49 pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or who had CP Ph+ CML that was resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 2 days and the duration was 2 days. Among patients who experienced diarrhea, the median number of episodes of diarrhea per patient during treatment with BOSULIF was 2 (range 1 – 198). To manage gastrointestinal toxicity, withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.2 Myelosuppression Thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia occur with BOSULIF treatment. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month of therapy and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. To manage myelosuppression, withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity Bosutinib may cause elevations in serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]). Two cases consistent with drug induced liver injury (defined as concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to 3×ULN with total bilirubin greater than 2×ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2×ULN) have occurred without alternative causes. This represented 2 out 1711 patients in BOSULIF clinical trials. In the 268 adult patients from the safety population in the randomized clinical trial in patients with newly-diagnosed CML in the BOSULIF treatment group, the incidence of ALT elevation was 68.3% and increased AST was 56%. Of patients who experienced increased transaminases of any grade, 73% experienced their first increase within the first 3 months. The median time to onset of increased ALT and AST was 29 and 56 days, respectively, and the median duration was 19 and 15 days, respectively. Among the 546 adult patients in a single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the incidence of increased ALT was 53.3% and AST elevation was 46.7%. Sixty percent of the patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Most cases of transaminase elevations in this study occurred early in treatment; of patients who experienced increased transaminases of any grade, more than 81% experienced their first increase within the first 3 months. The median time to onset of increased ALT and AST was 22 and 29 days, respectively, and the median duration for each was 21 days. Among 49 pediatric patients with newly‑diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or who had CP Ph+ CML that was resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the incidence based on laboratory data that worsened from baseline of increased ALT was 59% and of increased AST 51%. Seventy-six percent of the patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Most cases of increased transaminases occurred early in treatment; of patients who experienced increased transaminases of any grade, 84% of patients experienced their first increases within the first 3 months. The median time to onset for adverse reactions of increased ALT and AST was 22 and 15 days, respectively. The median duration for adverse reactions of Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT or AST was 26 and 12 days, respectively. Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first 3 months of BOSULIF treatment and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.4 Cardiovascular Toxicity BOSULIF can cause cardiovascular toxicity including cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac ischemic events. Cardiac failure events occurred more frequently in previously treated patients than in patients with newly diagnosed CML and were more frequent in patients with advanced age or risk factors, including previous medical history of cardiac failure. Cardiac ischemic events occurred in both previously treated patients and in patients with newly diagnosed CML and were more common in patients with coronary artery disease risk factors, including history of diabetes, body mass index greater than 30, hypertension, and vascular disorders. In a randomized study of adult patients with newly diagnosed CML, cardiac failure occurred in 1.9% of patients treated with BOSULIF compared to 0.8% of patients treated with imatinib. Cardiac ischemic events occurred in 4.9% of patients treated with BOSULIF compared to 0.8% of patients treated with imatinib. In a single-arm study in adult patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, cardiac failure was observed in 5.3% of patients and cardiac ischemic events were observed in 4.9% of patients treated with BOSULIF. Among 49 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or who had CP Ph+ CML that was resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, 4 (8%) patients had Grade 1-2 cardiac events, including tachycardia (n=2), angina pectoris, right bundle branch block, and sinus tachycardia (n=1 each). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac failure and cardiac ischemia and treat as clinically indicated. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.5 Fluid Retention Fluid retention occurs with BOSULIF and may manifest as pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. In the randomized clinical trial of 268 adult patients with newly-diagnosed CML in the bosutinib treatment group, 3 patients (1.1%) experienced severe fluid retention of Grade 3, 1 patient experienced Grade 3 pericardial effusion, and 2 patients experienced Grade 3 pleural effusion. Among 546 adult patients in a single-arm study in patients with Ph+ CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, Grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 30 patients (6%). Some patients experienced more than one fluid retention event. Specifically, 24 patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusions, 9 patients experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 pericardial effusions, and 6 patients experienced Grade 3 edema. Among 49 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or who had CP Ph+ CML that was resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, Grade 1-2 pericardial effusion, peripheral edema, and face edema were reported in 1 patient each. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.6 Renal Toxicity An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Table 5 identifies the shift from baseline to lowest observed eGFR during BOSULIF therapy for patients in the pooled leukemia studies regardless of line of therapy. The median duration of therapy with BOSULIF was approximately 24 months (range, 0.03 to 155) for patients in these studies. Table 6: Shift From Baseline to Lowest Observed eGFR Group During Treatment Safety Population in Clinical Studies (N=1372) Among the 1372 patients, eGFR was missing in 7 patients at baseline or on-therapy. There were no patients with kidney failure at baseline. Baseline Follow-Up Abbreviations: eGFR=estimated glomerular filtration rate; N/n=number of patients. Notes: eGFR was calculated using Modification in Diet in Renal Disease method (MDRD). Notes: Grading is based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Classification by eGFR: Normal: greater than or equal to 90, Mild: 60 to less than 90, Mild to Moderate: 45 to less than 60, Moderate to Severe: 30 to less than 45, Severe: 15 to less than 30, Kidney Failure: less than 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 .

Monitor renal function at baseline and during therapy with BOSULIF, with particular attention to those patients who have preexisting renal impairment or risk factors for renal dysfunction. Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, oral administration of bosutinib during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal mortality, and alterations to growth at maternal exposures (AUC) as low as 1.2 times the human exposure at the dose of 500 mg/day. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] ."

Patients received BOSULIF (n = 49) 300 mg/m 2 to 400 mg/m 2 orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median time on treatment with BOSULIF was 12.2 months (range, 0.2 to 60.9 months). Among patients who received BOSULIF, 77.6% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 51% were exposed for one year or longer. Permanent discontinuation of BOSULIF due to an adverse reaction occurred in 20% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation in 2 or more patients included ALT increased (6%), AST increased (4%), diarrhea (4%), fatigue (4%) and rash maculo-papular (4%). The most common adverse reactions, in ≥20% of BOSULIF-treated pediatric patients were diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, rash, fatigue, hepatic dysfunction, headache, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and constipation. Table 11 summarizes the adverse reactions in BCHILD. Table 11: Adverse Reactions (10% or Greater) in Pediatric Patients with Newly Diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or CP Ph+ CML Resistant or Intolerant to Prior Therapy Who Received BOSULIF in BCHILD Adverse drug reactions are based on all-causality treatment-emergent adverse reactions.

( 7.1 ) • Proton Pump Inhibitors: Use short-acting antacids or H2 blockers as an alternative to proton pump inhibitors. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on BOSULIF Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid the concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with BOSULIF. Bosutinib is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases bosutinib C max and AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may increase the risk of toxicities. Strong CYP3A Inducers Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers with BOSULIF. Bosutinib is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases bosutinib C max and AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may reduce BOSULIF efficacy. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) As an alternative to PPIs, use short-acting antacids or H2 blockers and separate dosing by more than 2 hours from BOSULIF dosing. Bosutinib displays pH dependent aqueous solubility, Concomitant use with a PPI decreases bosutinib C max and AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may reduce BOSULIF efficacy."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, oral administration of bosutinib during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal mortality, and alterations to growth at maternal exposures (AUC) as low as 1.2 times the human exposure at the dose of 500 mg/day ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat fertility and early embryonic development study, bosutinib was administered orally to female rats for approximately 3 to 6 weeks, depending on day of mating (2 weeks prior to cohabitation with untreated breeder males until gestation day [GD] 7). Increased embryonic resorptions occurred at greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day of bosutinib (1.6 and 1.2 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively), and decreased implantations and reduced number of viable embryos at 30 mg/kg/day of bosutinib (3.4 and 2.5 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively). In an embryo-fetal development study conducted in rabbits, bosutinib was administered orally to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day. At the maternally-toxic dose of 30 mg/kg/day of bosutinib, there were fetal anomalies (fused sternebrae, and 2 fetuses had various visceral observations), and an approximate 6% decrease in fetal body weight. The dose of 30 mg/kg/day resulted in exposures (AUC) approximately 5.1 and 3.8 times the human exposures at the recommended doses of 400 and 500 mg/day, respectively. Fetal exposure to bosutinib-derived radioactivity during pregnancy was demonstrated in a placental-transfer study in pregnant rats. In a rat pre- and postnatal development study, bosutinib was administered orally to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis through lactation day 20 at doses of 10, 30, and 70 mg/kg/day. Reduced number of pups born occurred at greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day bosutinib (3.4 and 2.5 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively), and increased incidence of total litter loss and decreased growth of offspring after birth occurred at 70 mg/kg/day bosutinib (6.9 and 5.1 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of bosutinib or its metabolites in human milk or its effects on a breastfed child or on milk production. However, bosutinib is present in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a nursing child, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with BOSULIF and for 2 weeks after the last dose. Animal Data After a single radiolabeled bosutinib dose to lactating rats, radioactivity was present in the plasma of suckling offspring for 24 to 48 hours. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on findings from animal studies, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Females of reproductive potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with BOSULIF. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) during treatment with BOSULIF and for 2 weeks after the last dose. Infertility The risk of infertility in females or males of reproductive potential has not been studied in humans. Based on findings from animal studies, BOSULIF may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of BOSULIF have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML and CP Ph+ CML that is resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. Use of BOSULIF for these indications is based on data from BCHILD [NCT04258943]. The study included pediatric patients with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML in the following age groups: 2 patients 1 year of age to less than 6 years of age, 3 patients 6 years of age to less than 12 years of age, and 10 patients 12 years of age to less than 17 years of age. The study also included pediatric patients with CP Ph+ CML that was resistant or intolerant to prior therapy in the following age groups: 4 patients 1 year of age to less than 6 years of age, 10 patients 6 years of age to less than 12 years of age, and 10 patients 12 years of age to less than 17 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . BSA-normalized apparent clearance in 27 pediatric patients aged 4 to <17 years (141.3 L/h/m 2 ) was 29% higher than BSA-normalized apparent clearance in adult patients with CP Ph+ CML (109.2 L/h/m 2 ) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The recommended dosage of BOSULIF in pediatric patients is based on body-surface area (BSA) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of BOSULIF in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML, pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age with CP Ph+ CML that is resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, and pediatric patients with AP Ph+ CML or BP Ph+ CML have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy of BOSULIF in patients with Ph+ CML, 20% were age 65 and over, 4% were 75 and over. Of the 268 patients who received bosutinib in the study for newly diagnosed CML, 20% were age 65 and over, 5% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the BOSULIF starting dose in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance [CL cr ] 30 to 50 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault (C-G)) and severe (CL cr less than 30 mL/min, C-G) renal impairment at baseline. For patients who have declining renal function while on BOSULIF who cannot tolerate the starting dose, follow dose adjustment recommendations for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . BOSULIF has not been studied in patients undergoing hemodialysis. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Reduce the BOSULIF dosage in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B, or C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, oral administration of bosutinib during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal mortality, and alterations to growth at maternal exposures (AUC) as low as 1.2 times the human exposure at the dose of 500 mg/day ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat fertility and early embryonic development study, bosutinib was administered orally to female rats for approximately 3 to 6 weeks, depending on day of mating (2 weeks prior to cohabitation with untreated breeder males until gestation day [GD] 7). Increased embryonic resorptions occurred at greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day of bosutinib (1.6 and 1.2 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively), and decreased implantations and reduced number of viable embryos at 30 mg/kg/day of bosutinib (3.4 and 2.5 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively). In an embryo-fetal development study conducted in rabbits, bosutinib was administered orally to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day. At the maternally-toxic dose of 30 mg/kg/day of bosutinib, there were fetal anomalies (fused sternebrae, and 2 fetuses had various visceral observations), and an approximate 6% decrease in fetal body weight. The dose of 30 mg/kg/day resulted in exposures (AUC) approximately 5.1 and 3.8 times the human exposures at the recommended doses of 400 and 500 mg/day, respectively. Fetal exposure to bosutinib-derived radioactivity during pregnancy was demonstrated in a placental-transfer study in pregnant rats. In a rat pre- and postnatal development study, bosutinib was administered orally to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis through lactation day 20 at doses of 10, 30, and 70 mg/kg/day. Reduced number of pups born occurred at greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day bosutinib (3.4 and 2.5 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively), and increased incidence of total litter loss and decreased growth of offspring after birth occurred at 70 mg/kg/day bosutinib (6.9 and 5.1 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively)."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bosutinib is a TKI. Bosutinib inhibits the BCR-ABL kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases including Src, Lyn, and Hck. Bosutinib inhibited 16 of 18 imatinib-resistant forms of BCR-ABL kinase expressed in murine myeloid cell lines. Bosutinib did not inhibit the T315I and V299L mutant cells. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics A greater likelihood of response and a greater likelihood of safety events were observed with higher bosutinib exposure in clinical studies. The time course of bosutinib pharmacodynamic response has not been fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a single oral dose of 500 mg BOSULIF with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor), BOSULIF does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Bosutinib pharmacokinetics were assessed following oral dosing with food in adult patients with CML and were presented as geometric mean (CV%), unless otherwise specified. Bosutinib exhibits dose proportional increases in C max and AUC over the oral dose range of 200 to 800 mg (0.33 to 1.3 times the maximum approved recommended dosage of 600 mg). Bosutinib steady state C max was 127 ng/mL (31%), C trough was 68 ng/mL (39%) and AUC was 2370 ng•h/mL (34%) following multiple oral doses of BOSULIF 400 mg; Bosutinib steady state C max was 171 ng/mL (38%), C trough was 91 ng/mL (42%) and AUC was 3150 ng•h/mL (38%) following multiple oral doses of BOSULIF 500 mg. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bosutinib were observed following administration of either the tablet or capsule dosage forms of BOSULIF at the same dose, under fed conditions. Absorption The median bosutinib (minimum, maximum) time-‑to-C max (t max ) was 6.0 (6.0, 6.0) hours following oral administration of a single oral dose of BOSULIF 500 mg with food. The absolute bioavailability was 34% in healthy subjects. Effect of Food Bosutinib C max increased 1.8-fold and AUC increased 1.7-fold when BOSULIF tablets were given with a high fat meal to healthy subjects compared to administration under fasted condition. Bosutinib C max increased 1.6‑fold and AUC increased 1.5-fold when BOSULIF capsules were given with a high fat meal to healthy subjects compared to administration under fasted condition. The high-fat meal (800-1000 total calories) consisted of approximately 150 protein calories, 250 carbohydrate calories, and 500-600 fat calories. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bosutinib were observed following administration of a BOSULIF capsule that was opened and the contents mixed with applesauce or yogurt immediately before use. Distribution The mean (SD) apparent bosutinib volume of distribution is 6080 (1230) L after an oral dose of 500 mg of BOSULIF. Bosutinib protein binding is 94% in vitro and 96% ex vivo , and is independent of concentration. Elimination The mean (SD) bosutinib terminal phase elimination half life (t ½ ) was 22.5 (1.7) hours, and the mean (SD) apparent clearance was 189 (48) L/h following a single oral dose of BOSULIF. Metabolism Bosutinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Excretion Following a single oral dose of [ 14 C] radiolabeled bosutinib without food, 91.3% of the dose was recovered in feces and 3.3% of the dose recovered in urine. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Bosutinib AUC increased 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (CL cr : 30 to 50 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault (C-G)) and increased 1.6-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (CL cr less than 30 mL/min) following a single oral dose of BOSULIF 200 mg (0.33 times the maximum approved recommended dosage of 600 mg). No clinically significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of bosutinib was observed in subjects with mild renal impairment (CL cr : 51 to 80 mL/min, C-G) . BOSULIF has not been studied in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Bosutinib C max increased 2.4-fold, 2-fold, and 1.5-fold, and AUC increased 2.3-fold, 2-fold, and 1.9-fold in hepatic impairment Child-Pugh A, B, and C, respectively, following a single oral dose of BOSULIF 200 mg (0.33 times the maximum approved recommended dosage of 600 mg). Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of bosutinib in 27 pediatric patients aged 4 to less than 17 years with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or resistant/intolerant CP Ph+ CML were evaluated over the dose range of 300 mg/m 2 to 400 mg/m 2 administered orally once daily with food. Exposures increased in a dose proportional manner over the dose range of 300 mg/m 2 to 400 mg/m 2 . The bosutinib median (min, max) t max is approximately 3 hours post-dose (1, 8 hours). In 15 pediatric patients aged 4 to less than 17 years who received 300 mg/m 2 daily, steady state C max was 159 ng/mL (42%), C trough was 49 ng/mL (53%) and AUC was 2027 ng•h/mL (47%). In 6 pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 17 years who received 400 mg/m 2 daily, steady state C max was 198 ng/mL (37%), C trough was 42 ng/mL (105%), and AUC was 2514 ng•h/mL (35%). An increase in BSA correlated with an increase in apparent clearance and exposure metrics did not significantly differ across BSA or age in pediatric patients following the approved recommended BSA-based dosage. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Bosutinib C max increased 5.2-fold and AUC increased 8.6-foldfollowing a single dose of BOSULIF 100 mg (0.17 times the maximum approved recommended dosage) without food when used concomitantly with 400 mg ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) administered over multiple daily doses. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Bosutinib C max increased 1.5-fold and AUC increased 2.0-fold following a single dose of BOSULIF 500 mg with food when administered concomitantly with 125 mg aprepitant (a moderate CYP3A inhibitor). Strong CYP3A Inducers: Bosutinib C max decreased by 86% and AUC decreased by 94% following a single dose of BOSULIF 500 mg with food administered concomitantly with multiple daily doses of 600 mg of rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer). Proton Pump Inhibitors : Lansoprazole decreased bosutinib C max by 46% and AUC by 26% following a single oral dose of BOSULIF 400 mg without food when used concomitantly with lansoprazole 60 mg (proton pump inhibitor) administered over multiple daily doses. Bosutinib displays pH‑dependent aqueous solubility, in vitro [see Description (11) ].

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Patients with Newly-Diagnosed CP Ph+ CML The efficacy of BOSULIF in patients with newly-diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ CML was evaluated in the B osutinib trial in F irst-line chr O nic myelogenous leukemia t RE atment (BFORE) Trial: \"A Multicenter Phase 3, Open-Label Study of Bosutinib Versus Imatinib in Adult Patients With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia\" [NCT02130557]. The BFORE Trial is a 2-arm, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of BOSULIF 400 mg once daily alone compared with imatinib 400 mg once daily alone in adult patients with newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML. The trial randomized 536 patients (268 in each arm) with Ph+ or Ph- newly-diagnosed CP CML (intent-to-treat [ITT] population) including 487 patients with Ph+ CML harboring b2a2 and/or b3a2 transcripts at baseline and baseline BCR-ABL copies >0 (modified intent-to-treat [mITT] population). Randomization was stratified by Sokal score and geographical region. All patients are being treated and/or followed for up to 5 years (240 weeks). Efficacy was evaluated in the mITT population. The major efficacy outcome measure was major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months (48 weeks) defined as ≤0.1% BCR-ABL ratio on international scale (corresponding to ≥3 log reduction from standardized baseline) with a minimum of 3000 ABL transcripts as assessed by the central laboratory. Additional efficacy outcomes included CCyR by 12 months, defined as the absence of Ph+ metaphases in chromosome banding analysis of ≥20 metaphases derived from bone marrow aspirate or MMR if an adequate cytogenetic assessment was unavailable and MMR by 18 months (72 weeks). In the mITT population in this study, 57% of patients were males, 78% were Caucasian, and 19% were 65 years or older. The median age was 53 years. At baseline, the distribution of Sokal risk scores was similar in bosutinib and imatinib-treated patients (low risk: 35% and 39%; intermediate risk: 44% and 38%; high risk: 22% and 22%, respectively). After a minimum of 12 months follow-up, 78% of the 246 bosutinib-treated patients and 72% of the 239 imatinib-treated patients were still receiving treatment and with a minimum of 60 months of follow-up, 60% and 60% of patients, respectively, were still receiving treatment. The median treatment duration was 55.1 months for BOSULIF and 55.0 months for imatinib. The efficacy results from the BFORE trial are summarized in Table 13.

MMR by Month 60 (Week 240) in the mITT population was 74% (95% CI: 69, 80) in the bosutinib treatment group and 66% (95% CI: 60, 72) in the imatinib treatment group; odds ratio of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.25). MMR by Month 60 in the ITT population was also consistent with the mITT population (1.57 [95% CI: 1.08, 2.28]). After 60 months of follow-up, the median time to MMR in responders was 9.0 months for bosutinib and 11.9 months for imatinib. By 60 months, the MMR rates in each Sokal risk group for the bosutinib and imatinib-treated patients, respectively, were 78% and 72% for low risk, 74% and 67% for intermediate risk and 68% and 52% for high risk. After 60 months of follow-up, 6 (2%) bosutinib patients and 7 (3%) imatinib patients transformed to AP CML or BP CML while on treatment. At 60 months, the estimated overall survival rate was 95% (95% CI: 91, 97) in the bosutinib group and 94% (95% CI: 90, 96) in the imatinib group. 14.2 Adult Patients with Imatinib-Resistant or -Intolerant Ph+ CP, AP, and BP CML Study 200 (NCT00261846), a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BOSULIF 500 mg once daily in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML with separate cohorts for CP, AP, and BP disease previously treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib) or more than 1 TKI (imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib) . The definition of imatinib resistance included (1) failure to achieve or maintain any hematologic improvement within 4 weeks; (2) failure to achieve a CHR by 3 months, cytogenetic response by 6 months or major cytogenetic response (MCyR) by 12 months; (3) progression of disease after a previous cytogenetic or hematologic response; or (4) presence of a genetic mutation in the BCR-ABL gene associated with imatinib resistance. Imatinib intolerance was defined as inability to tolerate imatinib due to toxicity, or progression on imatinib and inability to receive a higher dose due to toxicity. The definitions of resistance and intolerance to both dasatinib and nilotinib were similar to those for imatinib. The protocol was amended to exclude patients with a known history of the T315I mutation after 396 patients were enrolled in the trial. The efficacy endpoints for patients with CP CML previously treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib) were the rate of attaining MCyR by Week 24 and the duration of MCyR. The efficacy endpoints for patients with CP CML previously treated with both imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI were the cumulative rate of attaining MCyR by Week 24 and the duration of MCyR. The efficacy endpoints for patients with previously treated AP and BP CML were confirmed CHR and overall hematologic response (OHR). The study enrolled 546 patients with CP, AP or BP CML. Of the total patient population 73% were imatinib resistant and 27% were imatinib intolerant . In this trial, 53% of patients were males, 65% were Caucasian, and 20% were 65 years old or older . Of the 546 treated patients, 506 were considered evaluable for cytogenetic or hematologic efficacy assessment. Patients were evaluable for efficacy if they had received at least 1 dose of BOSULIF and had a valid baseline efficacy assessment. Among evaluable patients, there were 262 patients with CP CML previously treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib), 112 patients with CP CML previously treated with both imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI, and 132 patients with advanced phase CML previously treated with at least 1 TKI. Median duration of BOSULIF treatment was 26 months in patients with CP CML previously treated with 1 TKI (imatinib), 9 months in patients with CP CML previously treated with imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI, 10 months in patients with AP CML previously treated with at least imatinib, and 3 months in patients with BP CML previously treated with at least imatinib. The 24 week efficacy and MCyR at any time results are summarized in Table 14. Table 14: Efficacy Results in Patients with Ph+ CP CML With Resistance to or Intolerance to Imatinib Prior Treatment With Imatinib Only (N=262 evaluable) n (%) Prior Treatment With Imatinib and Dasatinib or Nilotinib (N=112 evaluable) n (%) Abbreviations: CI=confidence interval; CML=chronic myelogenous leukemia; CP=chronic phase; MCyR=major cytogenetic response; N/n=number of patients; Ph+=Philadelphia chromosome positive. By Week 24 MCyR 105 (40.1) 29 (25.9) (95% CI) (34.1, 46.3) (18.1, 35.0) MCyR any time 156 (59.5) 45 (40.2) (53.3, 65.5) (31.0, 49.9) The long-term follow-up data analysis was based on a minimum of 60 months for patients with CP CML treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib) and a minimum of 48 months for patients with CP CML treated with imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI. For the 59.5% of patients with CP CML treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib) who achieved a MCyR at any time, the median duration of MCyR was not reached. Among these patients, 65.4% and 42.9% had a MCyR lasting at least 18 and 54 months, respectively. For the 40.2% of patients with CP CML treated with imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI who achieved a MCyR at any time, the median duration of MCyR was not reached. Among these patients, 64.4% and 35.6% had a MCyR lasting at least 9 and 42 months, respectively. Of the 403 treated patients with CP CML, 20 patients had confirmed disease transformation to AP or BP while on treatment with BOSULIF. The 48-week efficacy results in patients with accelerated and blast phases CML previously treated with at least imatinib are summarized in Table 15. Table 15: Efficacy Results in Patients With Accelerated Phase and Blast Phase CML Previously Treated With at Least Imatinib AP CML (N=72 evaluable) n (%) BP CML (N=60 evaluable) n (%) Abbreviations: AP=accelerated phase; BP=blast phase; CHR=complete hematologic response; CI=confidence interval; CML=chronic myelogenous leukemia; CI=confidence interval, OHR=overall hematologic response, CHR=complete hematologic response, N/n=number of patients CHR Overall hematologic response (OHR) = major hematologic response (complete hematologic response + no evidence of leukemia) or return to chronic phase (RCP). All responses were confirmed after 4 weeks. Complete hematologic response (CHR) for AP and BP CML: WBC less than or equal to institutional ULN, platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm 3 and less than 450,000/mm 3 , absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.0×10 9 /L, no blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood, less than 5% myelocytes + metamyelocytes in bone marrow, less than 20% basophils in peripheral blood, and no extramedullary involvement. No evidence of leukemia (NEL): Meets all other criteria for CHR except may have thrombocytopenia (platelets greater than or equal to 20,000/mm 3 and less than 100,000/mm 3 ) and/or neutropenia (ANC greater than or equal to 0.5×10 9 /L and less than 1.0×10 9 /L). Return to chronic phase (RCP) = disappearance of features defining accelerated or blast phases but still in chronic phase. by Week 48 22 (30.6) 10 (16.7) (95% CI) (20.2, 42.5) (8.3, 28.5) OHR by Week 48 41 (56.9) 17 (28.3) (95% CI) (44.7, 68.6) (17.5, 41.4) The long-term follow-up data analysis was based on a minimum of 48 months for patients with AP CML and BP CML. Of the 79 treated patients with AP CML, 3 patients had confirmed disease transformation to BP while on BOSULIF treatment. 14.3 Pediatric Patients with Newly-Diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or with CP Ph+ CML with Resistance or Intolerance to Prior Therapy The efficacy of BOSULIF in pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed (ND) chronic phase (CP) Ph+ CML and patients with resistant/intolerant (R/I) CP Ph+ CML was evaluated in the BCHILD trial [NCT04258943]. The BCHILD trial is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label study conducted to identify a recommended dose of bosutinib administered orally once daily in pediatric patients with ND CP Ph+ CML and pediatric patients with R/I CP Ph+ CML who have received at least one prior TKI therapy, to estimate the safety and tolerability and efficacy, and to evaluate the PK of bosutinib in this patient population. The study enrolled 28 patients with R/I CP Ph+ CML treated with BOSULIF at 300 mg/m 2 to 400 mg/m 2 orally once daily, and 21 patients with ND CP Ph+ CML treated at 300 mg/m 2 orally once daily. Efficacy outcomes included CCyR (defined as the absence of Ph+ metaphases in chromosome banding analysis of ≥20 metaphases, or <1% BCR-ABL1–positive nuclei of at least 200 peripheral blood interphase nuclei analyzed by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), or MMR if an adequate cytogenetic assessment was unavailable), MCyR (defined as CCyR or partial cytogenetic response of 1% to 35% Ph+ metaphases), and MMR (defined as ≤0.1% BCR-ABL ratio on international scale [IS]) at any time on study. Patients with ND CP Ph+ CML had a median age of 14 years (range 5 to 17 years); 68% were male; 81% were White, 14% were Black/African American, and 5% were race not reported. The major (MCyR) and complete (CCyR) cytogenetic responses among patients with ND CP Ph+ CML were 76.2% (95% CI: 52.8, 91.8) and 71.4% (95% CI: 47.8, 88.7), respectively. The MMR among patients with ND CP Ph+ CML was 28.6% (95% CI: 11.3, 52.3). The median duration of follow-up was 14.2 months (range: 1.1, 26.3 months) in patients with ND CP CML. Patients with R/I CP Ph+ CML included n=6 treated at 300 mg/m 2 (0.75 times the recommended dose), n=11 treated at 350 mg/m 2 (0.875 times the recommended dose), and n=11 at 400 mg/m 2 . Overall (n=28), patients had a median age of 11.5 years (range: 1 to 17 years); 57% were male; 43% were White, 7% were Black/African American, 14% were Asian, and 36% were race not reported. The major (MCyR) and complete (CCyR) cytogenetic responses among patients with R/I CP Ph+ CML were 82.1% (95% CI: 63.1, 93.9) and 78.6% (95% CI: 59.0, 91.7), respectively. The MMR among patients with R/I CP Ph+ CML was 50.0% (95% CI: 30.6, 69.4). The MR4.5 (defined as BCR-ABL/ABL IS ≤ 0.0032%) was 17.9% (95% CI: 6.1, 36.9). Among 14 patients who achieved MMR, two patients lost MMR after 13.6 months and 24.7 months on treatment. The median duration of follow-up for overall survival was 23.2 months (range: 1.0, 61.5 months) in patients with R/I CP Ph+ CML."
