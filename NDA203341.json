        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Newly-diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ CML: 400 mg orally once daily with food. ( 2.1 ) • Chronic, accelerated, or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy: 500 mg orally once daily with food. ( 2.1 ) • Consider dose escalation by increments of 100 mg once daily to a maximum of 600 mg daily in patients who do not reach complete hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular response and do not have Grade 3 or greater adverse reactions. ( 2.2 ) • Adjust dosage for toxicity and organ impairment ( 2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing The recommended dose is taken orally once daily with food. The tablet is to be swallowed whole and should not be broken or cut. Continue treatment with BOSULIF until disease progression or intolerance to therapy. If a dose is missed beyond 12 hours, the patient should skip the dose and take the usual prescribed dose on the following day. Newly-Diagnosed CP Ph+ CML The recommended dose of BOSULIF is 400 mg orally once daily with food. CP, AP, or BP Ph+ CML with Resistance or Intolerance to Prior Therapy The recommended dose and schedule of BOSULIF is 500 mg orally once daily with food. 2.2 Dose Escalation In clinical studies of adult Ph+ CML patients, dose escalation by increments of 100 mg once daily to a maximum of 600 mg once daily was allowed in patients who did not achieve or maintain a hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular response and who did not have Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions at the recommended starting dosage. 2.3 Dose Adjustments for Non-Hematologic Adverse Reactions Elevated liver transaminases: If elevations in liver transaminases greater than 5×institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) occur, withhold BOSULIF until recovery to less than or equal to 2.5×ULN and resume at 400 mg once daily thereafter. If recovery takes longer than 4 weeks, discontinue BOSULIF. If transaminase elevations greater than or equal to 3×ULN occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations greater than 2×ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2×ULN (Hy's law case definition), discontinue BOSULIF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Diarrhea: For National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Grade 3–4 diarrhea (increase of greater than or equal to 7 stools/day over baseline/pretreatment), withhold BOSULIF until recovery to Grade less than or equal to 1. BOSULIF may be resumed at 400 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For other clinically significant, moderate or severe non-hematological toxicity, withhold BOSULIF until the toxicity has resolved, then consider resuming BOSULIF at a dose reduced by 100 mg taken once daily. If clinically appropriate, consider re-escalating the dose of BOSULIF to the starting dose taken once daily. Doses less than 300 mg/day have been used in patients; however, efficacy has not been established. 2.4 Dose Adjustments for Myelosuppression Dose reductions for severe or persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are described below (Table 1).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Monitor and manage as necessary. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) • Myelosuppression: Monitor blood counts and manage as necessary. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) • Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor liver enzymes at least monthly for the first 3 months and as needed. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 2.3 , 5.3 ) • Cardiovascular Toxicity: Monitor and manage as necessary. ( 5.4 ) • Fluid Retention: Monitor patients and manage using standard of care treatment. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 2.3 , 5.5 ) • Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients for renal function at baseline and during therapy with BOSULIF. ( 5.6 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: BOSULIF can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Toxicity Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occur with BOSULIF treatment. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and fluid replacement. In the randomized clinical trial in patients with newly-diagnosed Ph+ CML, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 4 days and the median duration per event was 3 days. Among 546 patients in a single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 2 days and the median duration per event was 2 days. Among the patients who experienced diarrhea, the median number of episodes of diarrhea per patient during treatment with BOSULIF was 3 (range 1–268). To manage gastrointestinal toxicity, withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.2 Myelosuppression Thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia occur with BOSULIF treatment. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month of therapy and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. To manage myelosuppression, withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity Bosutinib may cause elevations in serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]). Two cases consistent with drug induced liver injury (defined as concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to 3×ULN with total bilirubin greater than 2×ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2×ULN) have occurred without alternative causes. This represented 2 out 1711 patients in BOSULIF clinical trials. In the 268 patients from the safety population in the randomized clinical trial in patients with newly-diagnosed CML in the BOSULIF treatment group, the incidence of ALT elevation was 68.3% and AST elevation was 56.0%. Of patients who experienced transaminase elevations of any grade, 73% experienced their first event within the first 3 months. The median time to onset of increased ALT and AST was 29 and 56 days, respectively, and the median duration was 19 and 15 days, respectively. Among the 546 patients in a single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the incidence of ALT elevation was 53.3% and AST elevation was 46.7%. Sixty percent of the patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Most cases of transaminase elevations in this study occurred early in treatment; of patients who experienced transaminase elevations of any grade, more than 81% experienced their first event within the first 3 months. The median time to onset of increased ALT and AST was 22 and 29 days, respectively, and the median duration for each was 21 days. Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first 3 months of BOSULIF treatment and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.4 Cardiovascular Toxicity BOSULIF can cause cardiovascular toxicity including cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac ischemic events. Cardiac failure events occurred more frequently in previously treated patients than in patients with newly diagnosed CML and were more frequent in patients with advanced age or risk factors, including previous medical history of cardiac failure. Cardiac ischemic events occurred in both previously treated patients and in patients with newly diagnosed CML and were more common in patients with coronary artery disease risk factors, including history of diabetes, body mass index greater than 30, hypertension, and vascular disorders. In a randomized study with newly diagnosed CML, cardiac failure occurred in 1.9% of patients treated with BOSULIF compared to 0.8% of patients treated with imatinib. Cardiac ischemic events occurred in 4.9% of patients treated with BOSULIF compared to 0.8% of patients treated with imatinib. In a single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, cardiac failure was observed in 5.3% of patients and cardiac ischemic events were observed in 4.9% of patients treated with BOSULIF. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac failure and cardiac ischemia and treat as clinically indicated. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.5 Fluid Retention Fluid retention occurs with BOSULIF and may manifest as pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. In the randomized clinical trial of 268 patients with newly-diagnosed CML in the bosutinib treatment group, 3 patients (1.1%) experienced severe fluid retention of Grade 3, 1 patient experienced Grade 3 pericardial effusion, and 2 patients experienced Grade 3 pleural effusion. Among 546 patients in a single-arm study in patients with Ph+ CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, Grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 30 patients (6%). Some patients experienced more than one fluid retention event. Specifically, 24 patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusions, 9 patients experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 pericardial effusions, and 6 patients experienced Grade 3 edema. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.6 Renal Toxicity An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Table 3 identifies the shift from baseline to lowest observed eGFR during BOSULIF therapy for patients in the pooled leukemia studies regardless of line of therapy. The median duration of therapy with BOSULIF was approximately 24 months (range, 0.03 to 155) for patients in these studies. Table 3: Shift From Baseline to Lowest Observed eGFR Group During Treatment Safety Population in Clinical Studies (N=1372) Among the 1372 patients, eGFR was missing in 7 patients at baseline or on-therapy. There were no patients with kidney failure at baseline.

Notes: eGFR was calculated using Modification in Diet in Renal Disease method (MDRD). Notes: Grading is based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Classification by eGFR: Normal: greater than or equal to 90, Mild: 60 to less than 90, Mild to Moderate: 45 to less than 60, Moderate to Severe: 30 to less than 45, Severe: 15 to less than 30, Kidney Failure: less than 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 .

Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, oral administration of bosutinib during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal mortality, and alterations to growth at maternal exposures (AUC) as low as 1.2 times the human exposure at the dose of 500 mg/day. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] ."

Avoid the concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with BOSULIF. Strong CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased bosutinib C max and AUC compared to BOSULIF alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may reduce BOSULIF efficacy. Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers with BOSULIF . Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) Concomitant use with a PPI decreased bosutinib C max and AUC compared to BOSULIF alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may reduce BOSULIF efficacy.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, oral administration of bosutinib during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal mortality, and alterations to growth at maternal exposures (AUC) as low as 1.2 times the human exposure at the dose of 500 mg/day ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat fertility and early embryonic development study, bosutinib was administered orally to female rats for approximately 3 to 6 weeks, depending on day of mating (2 weeks prior to cohabitation with untreated breeder males until gestation day [GD] 7). Increased embryonic resorptions occurred at greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day of bosutinib (1.6 and 1.2 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively), and decreased implantations and reduced number of viable embryos at 30 mg/kg/day of bosutinib (3.4 and 2.5 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively). In an embryo-fetal development study conducted in rabbits, bosutinib was administered orally to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day. At the maternally-toxic dose of 30 mg/kg/day of bosutinib, there were fetal anomalies (fused sternebrae, and 2 fetuses had various visceral observations), and an approximate 6% decrease in fetal body weight. The dose of 30 mg/kg/day resulted in exposures (AUC) approximately 5.1 and 3.8 times the human exposures at the recommended doses of 400 and 500 mg/day, respectively. Fetal exposure to bosutinib-derived radioactivity during pregnancy was demonstrated in a placental-transfer study in pregnant rats. In a rat pre- and postnatal development study, bosutinib was administered orally to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis through lactation day 20 at doses of 10, 30, and 70 mg/kg/day. Reduced number of pups born occurred at greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day bosutinib (3.4 and 2.5 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively), and increased incidence of total litter loss and decreased growth of offspring after birth occurred at 70 mg/kg/day bosutinib (6.9 and 5.1 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of bosutinib or its metabolites in human milk or its effects on a breastfed child or on milk production. However, bosutinib is present in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a nursing child, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with BOSULIF and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. Animal Data After a single radiolabeled bosutinib dose to lactating rats, radioactivity was present in the plasma of suckling offspring for 24 to 48 hours. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Based on findings from animal studies, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females of reproductive potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with BOSULIF. Contraception Females Based on findings from animal studies, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) during treatment with BOSULIF and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. Infertility The risk of infertility in females or males of reproductive potential has not been studied in humans. Based on findings from animal studies, BOSULIF may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of BOSULIF in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy of BOSULIF in patients with Ph+ CML, 20% were age 65 and over, 4% were 75 and over. Of the 268 patients who received bosutinib in the study for newly diagnosed CML, 20% were age 65 and over, 5% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the BOSULIF starting dose in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to 50 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault (C-G)) and severe (CL cr less than 30 mL/min, C-G) renal impairment at baseline. For patients who have declining renal function while on BOSULIF who cannot tolerate the starting dose, follow dose adjustment recommendations for toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . BOSULIF has not been studied in patients undergoing hemodialysis. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Reduce the BOSULIF dosage in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B, or C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, oral administration of bosutinib during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal mortality, and alterations to growth at maternal exposures (AUC) as low as 1.2 times the human exposure at the dose of 500 mg/day ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat fertility and early embryonic development study, bosutinib was administered orally to female rats for approximately 3 to 6 weeks, depending on day of mating (2 weeks prior to cohabitation with untreated breeder males until gestation day [GD] 7). Increased embryonic resorptions occurred at greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day of bosutinib (1.6 and 1.2 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively), and decreased implantations and reduced number of viable embryos at 30 mg/kg/day of bosutinib (3.4 and 2.5 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively). In an embryo-fetal development study conducted in rabbits, bosutinib was administered orally to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day. At the maternally-toxic dose of 30 mg/kg/day of bosutinib, there were fetal anomalies (fused sternebrae, and 2 fetuses had various visceral observations), and an approximate 6% decrease in fetal body weight. The dose of 30 mg/kg/day resulted in exposures (AUC) approximately 5.1 and 3.8 times the human exposures at the recommended doses of 400 and 500 mg/day, respectively. Fetal exposure to bosutinib-derived radioactivity during pregnancy was demonstrated in a placental-transfer study in pregnant rats. In a rat pre- and postnatal development study, bosutinib was administered orally to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis through lactation day 20 at doses of 10, 30, and 70 mg/kg/day. Reduced number of pups born occurred at greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day bosutinib (3.4 and 2.5 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively), and increased incidence of total litter loss and decreased growth of offspring after birth occurred at 70 mg/kg/day bosutinib (6.9 and 5.1 times the human exposure at the recommended doses of 400 or 500 mg/day, respectively)."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bosutinib is a TKI. Bosutinib inhibits the BCR-ABL kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases including Src, Lyn, and Hck. Bosutinib inhibited 16 of 18 imatinib-resistant forms of BCR-ABL kinase expressed in murine myeloid cell lines. Bosutinib did not inhibit the T315I and V299L mutant cells. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on the exposure response analyses for efficacy, a relationship between drug exposure and a greater likelihood of response was observed in clinical studies. Based on the exposure response analyses for safety, a relationship between drug exposure and a greater likelihood of safety events was observed in clinical studies. Cardiac Electrophysiology At a single oral dose of 500 mg BOSULIF with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor), BOSULIF does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The bosutinib pharmacokinetics following oral dosing was assessed with food, unless otherwise specified. Bosutinib exhibits dose proportional increases in AUC and C max over the oral dose range of 200 to 800 mg (0.33 to 1.3 times the maximum approved recommended dosage of 600 mg). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) C max was 146 (20) ng/mL and the mean (SD) AUC was 2720 (442) ng∙h/mL following multiple oral doses of BOSULIF 400 mg in patients with CML; C max was 200 (12) ng/mL and AUC was 3650 (425) ng∙h/mL following multiple oral doses of BOSULIF 500 mg in patients with CML. Absorption Following administration of a single oral dose of BOSULIF 500 mg with food in patients with CML, the median (minimum, maximum) time-to-peak concentration (t max ) was 6.0 (6.0, 6.0) hours. The absolute bioavailability was 34% in healthy subjects. Effect of Food When given with a high fat meal in healthy subjects, oral bosutinib C max increased 1.8-fold and AUC increased 1.7-fold. The high-fat meal (800–1000 total calories) consisted of approximately 150 protein calories, 250 carbohydrate calories, and 500–600 fat calories. Distribution Following a single intravenous dose of bosutinib 120 mg (0.2 times the maximum approved recommended oral dosage of 600 mg) in healthy subjects, bosutinib had a mean (SD) volume of distribution of 2441 (796) L. The mean (SD) apparent volume of distribution after an oral dose of 500 mg of BOSULIF to patients with CML was 6080 (1230) L. Protein binding of bosutinib is 94% in vitro and 96% ex vivo, and is independent of concentration. Elimination Following a single intravenous dose of bosutinib 120 mg (0.2 times the maximum approved recommended oral dosage of 600 mg), the mean (SD) terminal phase elimination half-life (t ½ ) was 35.5 (8.5) hours, and the mean (SD) clearance (Cl) was 63.6 (14.1) L/h. Following a single oral dose of BOSULIF in patients with CML, the mean (SD) t ½ was 22.5 (1.7) hours, and the mean (SD) Cl was 189 (48) L/h. Metabolism Bosutinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Excretion Following a single oral dose of [ 14 C] radiolabeled bosutinib without food, 91.3% of the dose was recovered in feces and 3.3% of the dose recovered in urine. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Following a single oral dose of BOSULIF 200 mg (0.33 times the maximum approved recommended dosage of 600 mg), bosutinib AUC increased 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment (CL cr : 30 to 50 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault (C-G)) and increased 1.6-fold in subjects with severe renal impairment (CL cr less than 30 mL/min) compared to subjects with normal renal function (CLcr > 80 mL/min, C-G). No clinically significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of bosutinib was observed in subjects with mild renal impairment (CL cr : 51 to 80 mL/min, C-G) . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following a single oral dose of BOSULIF 200 mg (0.33 times the maximum approved recommended dosage of 600 mg), bosutinib C max increased 2.4-fold, 2-fold, and 1.5-fold, and AUC increased 2.3-fold, 2-fold, and 1.9-fold in hepatic impairment Child-Pugh A, B, and C, respectively. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies The following interactions were evaluated in crossover studies of healthy subjects, unless otherwise specified. Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors A single oral dose of BOSULIF 100 mg (0.17 times the maximum approved recommended dosage) was administered alone or following multiple daily doses of 400 mg ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) without food. Ketoconazole increased bosutinib C max and AUC 5.2-fold and 8.6-fold, respectively. A single oral dose of BOSULIF 500 mg was administered alone or in combination with 125 mg aprepitant (a moderate CYP3A inhibitor) with food. Aprepitant increased bosutinib C max 1.5-fold and AUC 2.0-fold. Strong CYP3A Inducers A single dose of BOSULIF 500 mg was administered alone or following multiple daily doses of 600 mg rifampin with food. Rifampin decreased bosutinib C max by 86% and AUC by 94%. Proton Pump Inhibitors BOSULIF displays pH-dependent aqueous solubility, in vitro. A single oral dose of BOSULIF 400 mg was administered alone or following multiple oral doses of lansoprazole 60 mg without food. Lansoprazole decreased bosutinib C max by 46% and AUC by 26%. P-gp Substrates A single oral dose of 500 mg BOSULIF was administered in combination with a single oral dose of 150 mg dabigatran etexilate mesylate (a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate). No clinically significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran was observed following bosutinib administration. In Vitro Studies Bosutinib Effect on Transporters Bosutinib may have the potential to inhibit breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in the gastrointestinal tract but has a low potential to inhibit BCRP, systemically, or organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)1, and OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations."

The BFORE Trial is a 2-arm, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of BOSULIF 400 mg once daily alone compared with imatinib 400 mg once daily alone in adult patients with newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML. The trial randomized 536 patients (268 in each arm) with Ph+ or Ph- newly-diagnosed CP CML (intent-to-treat [ITT] population) including 487 patients with Ph+ CML harboring b2a2 and/or b3a2 transcripts at baseline and baseline BCR-ABL copies >0 (modified intent-to-treat [mITT] population). Randomization was stratified by Sokal score and geographical region. All patients are being treated and/or followed for up to 5 years (240 weeks). Efficacy was evaluated in the mITT population. The major efficacy outcome measure was major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months (48 weeks) defined as ≤0.1% BCR-ABL ratio on international scale (corresponding to ≥3 log reduction from standardized baseline) with a minimum of 3000 ABL transcripts as assessed by the central laboratory. Additional efficacy outcomes included CCyR by 12 months, defined as the absence of Ph+ metaphases in chromosome banding analysis of ≥20 metaphases derived from bone marrow aspirate or MMR if an adequate cytogenetic assessment was unavailable and MMR by 18 months (72 weeks). In the mITT population in this study, 57% of patients were males, 78% were Caucasian, and 19% were 65 years or older. The median age was 53 years. At baseline, the distribution of Sokal risk scores was similar in bosutinib and imatinib-treated patients (low risk: 35% and 39%; intermediate risk: 44% and 38%; high risk: 22% and 22%, respectively). After a minimum of 12 months follow-up, 78% of the 246 bosutinib-treated patients and 72% of the 239 imatinib-treated patients were still receiving treatment and with a minimum of 60 months of follow-up, 60% and 60% of patients, respectively, were still receiving treatment. The median treatment duration was 55.1 months for BOSULIF and 55.0 months for imatinib. The efficacy results from the BFORE trial are summarized in Table 8.

MMR by Month 60 (Week 240) in the mITT population was 74% (95% CI: 69, 80) in the bosutinib treatment group and 66% (95% CI: 60, 72) in the imatinib treatment group; odds ratio of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.25). MMR by Month 60 in the ITT population was also consistent with the mITT population (1.57 [95% CI: 1.08, 2.28]). After 60 months of follow-up, the median time to MMR in responders was 9.0 months for bosutinib and 11.9 months for imatinib. By 60 months, the MMR rates in each Sokal risk group for the bosutinib and imatinib-treated patients, respectively, were 78% and 72% for low risk, 74% and 67% for intermediate risk and 68% and 52% for high risk. After 60 months of follow-up, 6 (2%) bosutinib patients and 7 (3%) imatinib patients transformed to AP CML or BP CML while on treatment. At 60 months, the estimated overall survival rate was 95% (95% CI: 91, 97) in the bosutinib group and 94% (95% CI: 90, 96) in the imatinib group. 14.2 Imatinib-Resistant or -Intolerant Ph+ CP, AP, and BP CML Study 200 (NCT00261846), a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BOSULIF 500 mg once daily in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML with separate cohorts for CP, AP, and BP disease previously treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib) or more than 1 TKI (imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib) . The definition of imatinib resistance included (1) failure to achieve or maintain any hematologic improvement within 4 weeks; (2) failure to achieve a CHR by 3 months, cytogenetic response by 6 months or major cytogenetic response (MCyR) by 12 months; (3) progression of disease after a previous cytogenetic or hematologic response; or (4) presence of a genetic mutation in the BCR-ABL gene associated with imatinib resistance. Imatinib intolerance was defined as inability to tolerate imatinib due to toxicity, or progression on imatinib and inability to receive a higher dose due to toxicity. The definitions of resistance and intolerance to both dasatinib and nilotinib were similar to those for imatinib. The protocol was amended to exclude patients with a known history of the T315I mutation after 396 patients were enrolled in the trial. The efficacy endpoints for patients with CP CML previously treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib) were the rate of attaining MCyR by Week 24 and the duration of MCyR. The efficacy endpoints for patients with CP CML previously treated with both imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI were the cumulative rate of attaining MCyR by Week 24 and the duration of MCyR. The efficacy endpoints for patients with previously treated AP and BP CML were confirmed CHR and overall hematologic response (OHR). The study enrolled 546 patients with CP, AP or BP CML. Of the total patient population 73% were imatinib resistant and 27% were imatinib intolerant . In this trial, 53% of patients were males, 65% were Caucasian, and 20% were 65 years old or older . Of the 546 treated patients, 506 were considered evaluable for cytogenetic or hematologic efficacy assessment. Patients were evaluable for efficacy if they had received at least 1 dose of BOSULIF and had a valid baseline efficacy assessment. Among evaluable patients, there were 262 patients with CP CML previously treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib), 112 patients with CP CML previously treated with both imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI, and 132 patients with advanced phase CML previously treated with at least 1 TKI. Median duration of BOSULIF treatment was 26 months in patients with CP CML previously treated with 1 TKI (imatinib), 9 months in patients with CP CML previously treated with imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI, 10 months in patients with AP CML previously treated with at least imatinib, and 3 months in patients with BP CML previously treated with at least imatinib. The 24 week efficacy and MCyR at any time results are summarized in Table 9. Table 9: Efficacy Results in Patients with Ph+ CP CML With Resistance to or Intolerance to Imatinib Prior Treatment With Imatinib Only (N=262 evaluable) n (%) Prior Treatment With Imatinib and Dasatinib or Nilotinib (N=112 evaluable) n (%) Abbreviations: CI=confidence interval; CML=chronic myelogenous leukemia; CP=chronic phase; MCyR=major cytogenetic response; N/n=number of patients; Ph+=Philadelphia chromosome positive. By Week 24 MCyR 105 (40.1) 29 (25.9) (95% CI) (34.1, 46.3) (18.1, 35.0) MCyR any time 156 (59.5) 45 (40.2) (53.3, 65.5) (31.0, 49.9) The long term follow-up data analysis was based on a minimum of 60 months for patients with CP CML treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib) and a minimum of 48 months for patients with CP CML treated with imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI. For the 59.5% of patients with CP CML treated with 1 prior TKI (imatinib) who achieved a MCyR at any time, the median duration of MCyR was not reached. Among these patients, 65.4% and 42.9% had a MCyR lasting at least 18 and 54 months, respectively. For the 40.2% of patients with CP CML treated with imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI who achieved a MCyR at any time, the median duration of MCyR was not reached. Among these patients, 64.4% and 35.6% had a MCyR lasting at least 9 and 42 months, respectively. Of the 403 treated patients with CP CML, 20 patients had confirmed disease transformation to AP or BP while on treatment with BOSULIF. The 48 week efficacy results in patients with accelerated and blast phases CML previously treated with at least imatinib are summarized in Table 10.
