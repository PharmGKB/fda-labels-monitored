Alectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, but was positive with an increased number of micronuclei in a rat bone marrow micronucleus test. The mechanism of micronucleus induction was abnormal chromosome segregation (aneugenicity) and not a clastogenic effect on chromosomes. No studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of alectinib on fertility. No adverse effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in general toxicology studies conducted in rats and monkeys."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Alectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets ALK and RET. In nonclinical studies, alectinib inhibited ALK phosphorylation and ALK-mediated activation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT3 and AKT, and decreased tumor cell viability in multiple cell lines harboring ALK fusions, amplifications, or activating mutations. The major active metabolite of alectinib, M4, showed similar in vitro potency and activity. Alectinib and M4 demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against multiple mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including some mutations identified in NSCLC tumors in patients who have progressed on crizotinib. In mouse models implanted with tumors carrying ALK fusions, administration of alectinib resulted in antitumor activity and prolonged survival, including in mouse models implanted intracranially with ALK-driven tumor cell lines."
      ],
      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 have been characterized in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and healthy subjects. In patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation %) steady-state maximal concentration (Cmax,ss) for alectinib was 665 ng/mL (44%) and for M4 was 246 ng/mL (45%) with peak to trough concentration ratio of 1.2. The geometric mean steady-state area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12h,ss) for alectinib was 7,430 ng*h/mL (46%) and for M4 was 2,810 ng*h/mL (46%). Alectinib exposure is dose proportional across the dose range of 460 mg to 900 mg (i.e., 0.75 to 1.5 times the approved recommended dosage) under fed conditions. Alectinib and M4 reached steady-state concentrations by day 7. The geometric mean accumulation was approximately 6-fold for both alectinib and M4. Absorption Alectinib reached maximal concentrations at 4 hours following administration of ALECENSA 600 mg twice daily under fed conditions in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The absolute bioavailability of alectinib was 37% (90% CI: 34%, 40%) under fed conditions. A high-fat, high-calorie meal increased the combined exposure (AUC0-inf) of alectinib plus M4 by 3.1-fold (90% CI: 2.7, 3.6) following oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of ALECENSA. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution is 4,016 L for alectinib and 10,093 L for M4. Alectinib and M4 are bound to human plasma proteins greater than 99%, independent of drug concentration. Alectinib concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC approximate estimated alectinib free concentrations in the plasma. In vitro studies suggest that alectinib is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but M4 is a substrate of P-gp. Alectinib and M4 are not substrates of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, or OATP1B3. Elimination The apparent clearance (CL/F) is 81.9 L/hour for alectinib and 217 L/hour for M4. The geometric mean elimination half-life is 33 hours for alectinib and 31 hours for M4 in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Metabolism Alectinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 to its major active metabolite M4. The geometric mean metabolite/parent exposure ratio at steady-state is 0.40. M4 is subsequently metabolized by CYP3A4. Alectinib and M4 were the main circulating moieties in plasma, constituting 76% of the total radioactivity. Excretion Ninety-eight percent of the radioactivity was excreted in feces following oral administration of a single radiolabeled dose of alectinib under fed conditions. Eighty-four percent of the dose was excreted in the feces as unchanged alectinib, and 6% of the dose was excreted as M4. Excretion of radioactivity in urine was less than 0.5% of administered radiolabeled dose of alectinib. Specific Populations Age (21 to 83 years), body weight (38 to 128 kg), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 to ≤ 1.5 × ULN and AST any value), mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min), race (White, Asian, and Other), and sex had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of alectinib and M4. The pharmacokinetics of alectinib have not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), or end-stage renal disease . Hepatic Impairment: Following administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg ALECENSA, the geometric mean ratio [90% confidence interval] for the combined AUCinf of alectinib and M4 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) was 1.36 [0.947, 1.96]) and in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) was 1.76 [0.984, 3.15]) as compared to that in subjects with normal hepatic function. The combined Cmax of alectinib and M4 was comparable among the three groups. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The recommended dose of ALECENSA in patients with severe hepatic impairment is 450 mg orally twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Alectinib No clinically meaningful effect on the combined exposure of alectinib plus M4 was observed in clinical studies following co-administration of ALECENSA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor (posaconazole), a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin), or an acid-reducing agent (esomeprazole). Effect of Alectinib on Other Drugs No clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A substrate) or repaglinide (sensitive CYP2C8 substrate) is expected following co-administration with ALECENSA. In vitro studies suggest that alectinib and M4 do not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 or 2D6. In vitro studies suggest that alectinib and M4 inhibit P-gp and BCRP. Alectinib did not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2 transport activity in vitro."

In general toxicology studies, treatment of rats with doses of alectinib resulting in exposures greater than or equal to approximately 4.5 times those in humans treated with alectinib at 600 mg twice daily resulted in changes in the growing teeth and bones. Findings in teeth included discoloration and changes in tooth size along with histopathological disarrangement of the ameloblast and odontoblast layers. There were also decreases in the trabecular bone and increased osteoclast activity in the femur and sternum."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALECENSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available data on ALECENSA use in pregnant women. Administration of alectinib to pregnant rats and rabbits by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity and abortion at maternally toxic doses with exposures approximately 2.7 times those observed in humans treated with alectinib at 600 mg twice daily (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a preliminary rabbit embryo-fetal study, administration of alectinib by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in abortion or complete embryo-fetal mortality at a maternally toxic dose of 27 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.9-fold the estimated area under the curve (AUC0-24h,ss) in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg BID) in three of six pregnant rabbits. The remaining three pregnant rabbits in this group had few live fetuses, decreased fetal and placental weights, and retroesophageal subclavian artery. In a rat preliminary embryo-fetal development study, administration of alectinib during organogenesis resulted in complete litter loss in all pregnant rats at 27 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.5-fold the estimated AUC0-24h,ss in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg BID). Doses greater than or equal to 9 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.7-fold the estimated human AUC0-24h,ss in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg BID), resulted in maternal toxicity as well as developmental toxicities including decreased fetal weight, dilated ureter, thymic cord, small ventricle and thin ventricle wall, and reduced number of sacral and caudal vertebrae."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver laboratory tests every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month and as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and bilirubin elevations. In case of severe ALT, AST, or bilirubin elevations, withhold, then reduce dose, or permanently discontinue ALECENSA. (2.3, 5.1) Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Immediately withhold ALECENSA in patients diagnosed with ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis have been identified. (2.3, 5.2) Renal Impairment: Withhold ALECENSA for severe renal impairment, then resume ALECENSA at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue (2.3, 5.3). Bradycardia: Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. If symptomatic, withhold ALECENSA then reduce dose, or permanently discontinue. (2.3, 5.4) Severe Myalgia and Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation: Assess CPK every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment and in patients reporting unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. In case of severe CPK elevations, withhold, then resume or reduce dose. (2.3, 5.5) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: ALECENSA can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.6, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Elevations of AST greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 4.6% of patients, and elevations of ALT greater than 5 times the ULN occurred in 5.3% of the 405 patients in Studies NP28761, NP28673 and ALEX who received ALECENSA at a dose of 600 mg BID. Elevations of bilirubin greater than 3 times the ULN occurred in 3.7% of patients. The majority (69% of the patients with hepatic transaminase elevations and 68% of the patients with bilirubin elevations) of these events occurred during the first 3 months of treatment. Six patients discontinued ALECENSA for Grades 3–4 AST and/or ALT elevations, and 4 patients discontinued ALECENSA for Grade 3 bilirubin elevations. Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with ALECENSA across clinical trials. Three patients with Grades 3–4 AST/ALT elevations had drug-induced liver injury (documented by liver biopsy in two cases). Monitor liver function tests including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month and as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and bilirubin elevations. Based on the severity of the adverse drug reaction, withhold ALECENSA and resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue ALECENSA as described in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis ILD/pneumonitis occurred in three (0.7%) patients treated with ALECENSA in Studies NP28761, NP28673 and ALEX. One (0.2%) of these events was severe (Grade 3). Promptly investigate for ILD/pneumonitis in any patient who presents with worsening of respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever). Immediately withhold ALECENSA treatment in patients diagnosed with ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue ALECENSA if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis have been identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.3 Renal Impairment Renal impairment occurred in 8% of patients in Studies NP28761, NP28673, and ALEX. The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 renal impairment was 1.7%, of which 0.5% were fatal events. Dose modifications for renal impairment were required in 3.2% of patients. Median time to Grade ≥ 3 renal impairment was 3.7 months (range 0.5 to 14.7 months). Permanently discontinue ALECENSA for Grade 4 renal toxicity. Withhold ALECENSA for Grade 3 renal toxicity until recovery to less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN, then resume at reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.4 Bradycardia Symptomatic bradycardia can occur with ALECENSA. Cases of bradycardia (8.6%) have been reported in patients treated with ALECENSA in Studies NP28761, NP28673 and ALEX. Eighteen percent of 365 patients treated with ALECENSA for whom serial ECGs were available had heart rates of less than 50 beats per minute (bpm). Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. Dose modification is not required in cases of asymptomatic bradycardia. In cases of symptomatic bradycardia that is not life-threatening, withhold ALECENSA until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above and evaluate concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive medications. If attributable to a concomitant medication, resume ALECENSA at a reduced dose (see Table 1) upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent monitoring as clinically indicated. Permanently discontinue ALECENSA in case of recurrence. Permanently discontinue ALECENSA in cases of life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.5 Severe Myalgia and Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation Myalgia or musculoskeletal pain occurred in 26% of patients in Studies NP28761, NP28673 and ALEX. The incidence of Grade 3 myalgia/musculoskeletal pain was 0.7%. Dose modifications for myalgia/musculoskeletal pain were required in 0.5% of patients. Elevations of CPK occurred in 41% of 347 patients with CPK laboratory data available in Studies NP28761, NP28673 and ALEX. The incidence of Grade 3 elevations of CPK was 4.0%. Median time to Grade 3 CPK elevation was 14 days (interquartile range 13-28 days). Dose modifications for elevation of CPK occurred in 3.2 % of patients. Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Assess CPK levels every 2 weeks for the first month of treatment and as clinically indicated in patients reporting symptoms. Based on the severity of the CPK elevation, withhold ALECENSA, then resume or reduce dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALECENSA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Administration of alectinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity and abortion at maternally toxic doses with exposures approximately 2.7 times those observed in humans with alectinib 600 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALECENSA and for 1 week following the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Bradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Severe Myalgia and Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) were fatigue, constipation, edema, myalgia, and anemia. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The safety of ALECENSA was evaluated in 152 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in the ALEX study. The median duration of exposure to ALECENSA was 17.9 months. Patient characteristics of the ALEX study population (n=303) were: median age 56 years, age less than 65 (77%), female (56%), Caucasian (50%), Asian (46%), adenocarcinoma histology (92%), never smoker (63%), and ECOG PS 0 or 1 (93%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients treated with ALECENSA; serious adverse reactions reported in 2% or more of patients treated with ALECENSA were pneumonia (4.6%), and renal impairment (3.9%). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were reported for 41% of patients in the ALECENSA arm. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.3% of patients treated with ALECENSA; these were renal impairment (2 patients), sudden death, cardiac arrest, and pneumonia (1 patient each). Permanent discontinuation of ALECENSA for adverse reactions occurred in 11% of patients. Adverse drug reactions that led to discontinuation of ALECENSA in 1% or more of patients were renal impairment (2.0%), hyperbilirubinemia (1.3%), increased ALT (1.3%), and increased AST (1.3%). Dose reductions and drug interruption due to adverse reactions occurred in 16% and 19% of patients, respectively, in the ALECENSA arm. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose modifications in the ALECENSA arm were hyperbilirubinemia (6%), increased AST (5%), increased ALT (4.6%), and pneumonia (3.3%). Tables 3 and 4 summarize the common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in ALEX.

The median duration of exposure to ALECENSA was 9.3 months. One hundred sixty-nine patients (67%) were exposed to ALECENSA for more than 6 months, and 100 patients (40%) for more than one year. The population characteristics were: median age 53 years, age less than 65 (86%), female (55%), White (74%), Asian (18%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (96%), never or former smoker (98%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (91%), and prior chemotherapy treatment (78%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients; the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pulmonary embolism (1.2%), dyspnea (1.2%), and hyperbilirubinemia (1.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.8% of patients and included hemorrhage (0.8%), intestinal perforation (0.4%), dyspnea (0.4%), pulmonary embolism (0.4%), and endocarditis (0.4%). Permanent discontinuation of ALECENSA for adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation were hyperbilirubinemia (1.6%), increased ALT levels (1.6%), and increased AST levels (1.2%). Overall, 23% of patients initiating treatment at the recommended dose required at least one dose reduction. The median time to first dose reduction was 48 days. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reductions or interruptions were elevations in bilirubin (6%), CPK (4.3%), ALT (4.0%), and AST (2.8%), and vomiting (2.8%).

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Do not breastfeed. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, ALECENSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available data on ALECENSA use in pregnant women. Administration of alectinib to pregnant rats and rabbits by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity and abortion at maternally toxic doses with exposures approximately 2.7 times those observed in humans treated with alectinib at 600 mg twice daily (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a preliminary rabbit embryo-fetal study, administration of alectinib by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in abortion or complete embryo-fetal mortality at a maternally toxic dose of 27 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.9-fold the estimated area under the curve (AUC0-24h,ss) in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg BID) in three of six pregnant rabbits. The remaining three pregnant rabbits in this group had few live fetuses, decreased fetal and placental weights, and retroesophageal subclavian artery. In a rat preliminary embryo-fetal development study, administration of alectinib during organogenesis resulted in complete litter loss in all pregnant rats at 27 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.5-fold the estimated AUC0-24h,ss in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg BID). Doses greater than or equal to 9 mg/kg/day (approximately 2.7-fold the estimated human AUC0-24h,ss in humans treated with alectinib 600 mg BID), resulted in maternal toxicity as well as developmental toxicities including decreased fetal weight, dilated ureter, thymic cord, small ventricle and thin ventricle wall, and reduced number of sacral and caudal vertebrae. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of alectinib or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of alectinib on the breastfed infant, or its effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from alectinib, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with ALECENSA and for 1 week after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females ALECENSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALECENSA and for 1 week after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALECENSA and for 3 months following the final dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ALECENSA in pediatric patients have not been established. Animal Data Juvenile animal studies have not been conducted using alectinib. In general toxicology studies, treatment of rats with doses of alectinib resulting in exposures greater than or equal to approximately 4.5 times those in humans treated with alectinib at 600 mg twice daily resulted in changes in the growing teeth and bones. Findings in teeth included discoloration and changes in tooth size along with histopathological disarrangement of the ameloblast and odontoblast layers. There were also decreases in the trabecular bone and increased osteoclast activity in the femur and sternum. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ALECENSA did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. The safety of ALECENSA in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease has not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Increased exposure of alectinib occurred in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). The recommended dose of ALECENSA in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) is 450 mg orally twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The efficacy of ALECENSA for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who had not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease was established in an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter study (ALEX: NCT02075840). Patients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and ALK-positive NSCLC as identified by the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx assay. Neurologically stable patients with treated or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases, including leptomeningeal metastases, were eligible; patients with neurologic signs and symptoms due to CNS metastases were required to have completed whole brain radiation or gamma knife irradiation at least 14 days prior to enrollment and be clinically stable. Patients with a baseline QTc > 470 ms were ineligible. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ALECENSA 600 mg orally twice daily or crizotinib 250 mg orally twice daily. Randomization was stratified by ECOG performance status (0/1 vs. 2), race (Asian vs. non-Asian), and the presence or absence of CNS metastases at baseline. Treatment on both arms was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by investigator assessment according to RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS as determined by independent review committee (IRC), time to CNS progression by IRC based on RECIST v1.1, objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS). Additional exploratory outcome measures were CNS objective response rate (CNS-ORR) and CNS duration of response (CNS-DOR) by IRC in patients with CNS metastases at baseline. A total of 303 patients were randomized to ALECENSA (n=152) or crizotinib (n=151). The demographic characteristics of the study population were 56% female, median age 56 years (range: 18 to 91 years), 50% White, 46% Asian, 1% Black, and 3% other races. The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (92%) and never smoked (63%). CNS metastases were present in 40% (n=122) of patients: of these, 43 patients had measurable CNS lesions as determined by an IRC. The ALEX study demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS. The time to cause-specific CNS progression as assessed by IRC was also significantly improved; there was a lower incidence of progression in the CNS as the first site of disease progression, alone or with concurrent systemic progression, in the ALECENSA arm (12%) as compared to the crizotinib arm (45%). Efficacy results from ALEX are summarized in Table 7 and Figure 1 .

Patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, who have progressed on crizotinib, with documented ALK-positive NSCLC based on an FDA-approved test, and ECOG PS of 0-2 were enrolled in both studies. Eligibility criteria permitted enrollment of patients with prior chemotherapy and prior CNS radiotherapy provided that CNS metastases were stable for at least two weeks. All patients received ALECENSA 600 mg orally twice daily. The major efficacy outcome measure in both studies was objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated per Independent Review Committee (IRC). Additional outcome measures as evaluated by the IRC included duration of response (DOR), CNS ORR, and CNS DOR. NP28761 was conducted in North America and enrolled 87 patients. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics in NP28761 were median age 54 years old (range 29 to 79, 18% 65 and over), 84% White and 8% Asian, 55% female, 35% ECOG PS 0 and 55% ECOG PS 1, 100% never or former smokers, 99% Stage IV, 94% adenocarcinoma, and 74% prior chemotherapy. The most common sites of extra-thoracic metastasis included 60% CNS (of whom 65% had received CNS radiation), 43% lymph nodes, 36% bone, and 34% liver. NP28673 was conducted internationally and enrolled 138 patients. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics in NP28673 were median age 52 years old (range 22 to 79, 10% 65 and over), 67% White and 26% Asian, 56% female, 32% ECOG PS 0 and 59% ECOG PS 1, 98% never or former smokers, 99% Stage IV, 96% adenocarcinoma, and 80% prior chemotherapy. The most common sites of extra-thoracic metastasis included 61% CNS (of whom 73% had received CNS radiation), 51% bone, 38% lymph nodes, and 30% liver. Efficacy results from NP28761 and NP28673 in all treated patients are summarized in Table 9. The median duration of follow-up on Study NP28761 was 4.8 months for both IRC and Investigator assessments and on Study NP28673, 10.9 months for IRC assessment and 7.0 months for Investigator assessment.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Alectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets ALK and RET. In nonclinical studies, alectinib inhibited ALK phosphorylation and ALK-mediated activation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT3 and AKT, and decreased tumor cell viability in multiple cell lines harboring ALK fusions, amplifications, or activating mutations. The major active metabolite of alectinib, M4, showed similar in vitro potency and activity. Alectinib and M4 demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against multiple mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including some mutations identified in NSCLC tumors in patients who have progressed on crizotinib. In mouse models implanted with tumors carrying ALK fusions, administration of alectinib resulted in antitumor activity and prolonged survival, including in mouse models implanted intracranially with ALK-driven tumor cell lines. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The ability of alectinib to prolong the QT interval was assessed in 221 patients administered ALECENSA 600 mg twice daily in clinical studies. ALECENSA did not prolong the QTc (QT corrected for heart rate) interval to any clinically relevant extent. One patient had a maximum post-baseline QTcF value of greater than 500 msec, and one patient had a maximum QTcF change from baseline of greater than 60 msec. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of alectinib and its major active metabolite M4 have been characterized in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and healthy subjects. In patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation %) steady-state maximal concentration (Cmax,ss) for alectinib was 665 ng/mL (44%) and for M4 was 246 ng/mL (45%) with peak to trough concentration ratio of 1.2. The geometric mean steady-state area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12h,ss) for alectinib was 7,430 ng*h/mL (46%) and for M4 was 2,810 ng*h/mL (46%). Alectinib exposure is dose proportional across the dose range of 460 mg to 900 mg (i.e., 0.75 to 1.5 times the approved recommended dosage) under fed conditions. Alectinib and M4 reached steady-state concentrations by day 7. The geometric mean accumulation was approximately 6-fold for both alectinib and M4. Absorption Alectinib reached maximal concentrations at 4 hours following administration of ALECENSA 600 mg twice daily under fed conditions in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The absolute bioavailability of alectinib was 37% (90% CI: 34%, 40%) under fed conditions. A high-fat, high-calorie meal increased the combined exposure (AUC0-inf) of alectinib plus M4 by 3.1-fold (90% CI: 2.7, 3.6) following oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of ALECENSA. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution is 4,016 L for alectinib and 10,093 L for M4. Alectinib and M4 are bound to human plasma proteins greater than 99%, independent of drug concentration. Alectinib concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC approximate estimated alectinib free concentrations in the plasma. In vitro studies suggest that alectinib is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but M4 is a substrate of P-gp. Alectinib and M4 are not substrates of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, or OATP1B3. Elimination The apparent clearance (CL/F) is 81.9 L/hour for alectinib and 217 L/hour for M4. The geometric mean elimination half-life is 33 hours for alectinib and 31 hours for M4 in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Metabolism Alectinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 to its major active metabolite M4. The geometric mean metabolite/parent exposure ratio at steady-state is 0.40. M4 is subsequently metabolized by CYP3A4. Alectinib and M4 were the main circulating moieties in plasma, constituting 76% of the total radioactivity. Excretion Ninety-eight percent of the radioactivity was excreted in feces following oral administration of a single radiolabeled dose of alectinib under fed conditions. Eighty-four percent of the dose was excreted in the feces as unchanged alectinib, and 6% of the dose was excreted as M4. Excretion of radioactivity in urine was less than 0.5% of administered radiolabeled dose of alectinib. Specific Populations Age (21 to 83 years), body weight (38 to 128 kg), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 to ≤ 1.5 × ULN and AST any value), mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min), race (White, Asian, and Other), and sex had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of alectinib and M4. The pharmacokinetics of alectinib have not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), or end-stage renal disease . Hepatic Impairment: Following administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg ALECENSA, the geometric mean ratio [90% confidence interval] for the combined AUCinf of alectinib and M4 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) was 1.36 [0.947, 1.96]) and in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) was 1.76 [0.984, 3.15]) as compared to that in subjects with normal hepatic function. The combined Cmax of alectinib and M4 was comparable among the three groups. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The recommended dose of ALECENSA in patients with severe hepatic impairment is 450 mg orally twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Alectinib No clinically meaningful effect on the combined exposure of alectinib plus M4 was observed in clinical studies following co-administration of ALECENSA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor (posaconazole), a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin), or an acid-reducing agent (esomeprazole). Effect of Alectinib on Other Drugs No clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of midazolam (sensitive CYP3A substrate) or repaglinide (sensitive CYP2C8 substrate) is expected following co-administration with ALECENSA. In vitro studies suggest that alectinib and M4 do not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 or 2D6. In vitro studies suggest that alectinib and M4 inhibit P-gp and BCRP. Alectinib did not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2 transport activity in vitro."
