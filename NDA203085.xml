(7.2) •BCRP substrates: Monitor patients closely for symptoms of increased exposure to BCRP substrates. (7.3) 7.1 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Regorafenib Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer with STIVARGA decreased the plasma concentrations of regorafenib, increased the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite M-5, and resulted in no change in the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite M-2 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], and may lead to decreased efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of STIVARGA with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort). 7.2 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Regorafenib Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor with STIVARGA increased the plasma concentrations of regorafenib and decreased the plasma concentrations of the active metabolites M-2 and M-5 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], and may lead to increased toxicity. Avoid concomitant use of STIVARGA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole). 7.3 Effect of Regorafenib on Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Substrates Co-administration of STIVARGA with a BCRP substrate increased the plasma concentrations of the BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of exposure related toxicity to the BCRP substrate (e.g. methotrexate, fluvastatin, atorvastatin). Consult the concomitant BCRP substrate product information when considering administration of such products together with STIVARGA."

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies examining the carcinogenic potential of regorafenib have not been conducted. Regorafenib itself did not demonstrate genotoxicity in in vitro or in vivo assays; however, a major human active metabolite of regorafenib, (M-2), was positive for clastogenicity, causing chromosome aberration in Chinese hamster V79 cells. Dedicated studies to examine the effects of regorafenib on fertility have not been conducted; however, there were histological findings of tubular atrophy and degeneration in the testes, atrophy in the seminal vesicle, and cellular debris and oligospermia in the epididymides in male rats at doses similar to those in human at the clinical recommended dose based on AUC. In female rats, there were increased findings of necrotic corpora lutea in the ovaries at the same exposures. There were similar findings in dogs of both sexes in repeat dose studies at exposures approximately 83% of the human exposure at the recommended human dose based on AUC. These findings suggest that regorafenib may adversely affect fertility in humans. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In a chronic 26-week repeat dose study in rats there was a dose-dependent increase in the finding of thickening of the atrioventricular valve. At a dose that resulted in an exposure of approximately 12% of the human exposure at the recommended dose, this finding was present in half of the examined animals."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Regorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane-bound and intracellular kinases involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, metastasis and tumor immunity. In in vitro biochemical or cellular assays, regorafenib or its major human active metabolites M-2 and M-5 inhibited the activity of RET, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2, DDR2, TrkA, Eph2A, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAF V600E, SAPK2, PTK5, Abl and CSF1R at concentrations of regorafenib that have been achieved clinically. In in vivo models, regorafenib demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity in a rat tumor model and inhibition of tumor growth in several mouse xenograft models including some for human colorectal carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal and hepatocellular carcinoma. Regorafenib also demonstrated anti-metastatic activity in a mouse xenograft model and two mouse orthotopic models of human colorectal carcinoma."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 160 mg dose of STIVARGA in patients with advanced solid tumors, regorafenib reaches a geometric mean peak plasma level (Cmax) of 2.5 µg/mL at a median time of 4 hours and a geometric mean area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) of 70.4 µg*h/mL. The AUC of regorafenib at steady-state increases less than dose proportionally at doses greater than 60 mg. At steady-state, regorafenib reaches a geometric mean Cmax of 3.9 µg/mL and a geometric mean AUC of 58.3 µg*h/mL. The coefficient of variation of AUC and Cmax is between 35% and 44%. The mean relative bioavailability of tablets compared to an oral solution is 69% to 83%. In a food-effect study, 24 healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of STIVARGA on three separate occasions: under a fasted state, with a high-fat meal and with a low-fat meal. A high-fat meal (945 calories and 54.6 g fat) increased the mean AUC of regorafenib by 48% and decreased the mean AUC of the M-2 and M-5 metabolites by 20% and 51%, respectively, as compared to the fasted state. A low-fat meal (319 calories and 8.2 g fat) increased the mean AUC of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 by 36%, 40% and 23%, respectively as compared to fasted conditions. STIVARGA was administered with a low-fat meal in the CORRECT and GRID studies [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Distribution Regorafenib undergoes enterohepatic circulation with multiple plasma concentration peaks observed across the 24-hour dosing interval. Regorafenib is highly bound (99.5%) to human plasma proteins. Elimination Following a single 160 mg oral dose of STIVARGA, the geometric mean (minimum to maximum) elimination half-lives for regorafenib and the M-2 metabolite in plasma are 28 hours (14 to 58 hours) and 25 hours (14 to 32 hours), respectively. M-5 has a longer mean (minimum to maximum) elimination half-life of 51 hours (32 to 70 hours). Metabolism Regorafenib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and UGT1A9. The main circulating metabolites of regorafenib measured at steady-state in human plasma are M-2 (N-oxide) and M-5 (N-oxide and N-desmethyl). Both metabolites have similar in vitro pharmacological activity and steady-state concentrations as regorafenib. M-2 and M-5 are highly protein bound (99.8% and 99.95%, respectively). Excretion Approximately 71% of a radiolabeled dose was excreted in feces (47% as parent compound, 24% as metabolites) and 19% of the dose was excreted in urine (17% as glucuronides) within 12 days after administration of a radiolabeled oral solution at a dose of 120 mg. Specific Populations Age, sex, race and weight had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of regorafenib. Hepatic Impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically important differences in the mean total exposure of regorafenib, including M-2 and M-5, were noted amongst patients with normal liver function (total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN, n=744), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST >ULN or total bilirubin >ULN to ≤1.5x ULN, n=437), and moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5x to ≤3x ULN and any AST, n=36). The pooled analysis included 391 patients with HCC of whom 116, 249, and 26 were categorized as having normal liver function, mild, and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib were not evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3x ULN). Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, M-2, and M-5 was evaluated in 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min) and 18 patients with normal/mild renal function (CLcr ≥60 mL/min) following the administration of STIVARGA at a dose of 160 mg daily for 21 days. No differences in the mean steady-state exposure of regorafenib, M-2, or M-5 were observed in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Regorafenib on Cytochrome P450 Substrates: In vitro studies suggested that regorafenib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19; M-2 is an inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and M-5 is an inhibitor of CYP2C8. In vitro studies suggested that regorafenib is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme activity. Patients with advanced solid tumors received single oral doses of CYP substrates, 2 mg of midazolam (CYP3A4), 40 mg of omeprazole (CYP2C19) and 10 mg of warfarin (CYP2C9) or 4 mg of rosiglitazone (CYP2C8) one week before and two weeks after STIVARGA at a dose of 160 mg once daily. No clinically meaningful effect was observed in the mean AUC of rosiglitazone (N=12) or the mean omeprazole (N=11) plasma concentrations measured 6 hours after dosing or the mean AUC of midazolam (N=15). The mean AUC of warfarin (N=8) increased by 25% [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Effect of CYP3A4 Strong Inducers on Regorafenib: Twenty-two healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of STIVARGA alone and then 7 days after starting rifampin. Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, was administered at a dose of 600 mg daily for 9 days. The mean AUC of regorafenib decreased by 50% and mean AUC of M-5 increased by 264%. No change in the mean AUC of M-2 was observed [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Effect of CYP3A4 Strong Inhibitors on Regorafenib: Eighteen healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of STIVARGA alone and then 5 days after starting ketoconazole. Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, was administered at a dose of 400 mg daily for 18 days. The mean AUC of regorafenib increased by 33% and the mean AUC of M-2 and M-5 both decreased by 93% [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Effect of Neomycin on Regorafenib: Twenty-seven healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of STIVARGA and then 5 days after starting neomycin. Neomycin, a non-absorbable antibiotic, was administered at a dose of 1 gram three times daily for 5 days. No clinically meaningful effect on the mean AUC of regorafenib was observed; however, the mean AUC of M-2 decreased by 76% and the mean AUC of M-5 decreased by 86%. The decreased exposure of M-2 and M-5 may result in a decreased efficacy of STIVARGA. The effects of other antibiotics on the exposure of regorafenib and its active metabolites have not been studied. Effect of Regorafenib on UGT1A1 Substrates: In vitro studies showed that regorafenib, M-2, and M-5 competitively inhibit UGT1A9 and UGT1A1 at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Eleven patients received irinotecan-containing combination chemotherapy with STIVARGA at a dose of 160 mg. The mean AUC of irinotecan increased by 28% and the mean AUC of SN-38 increased by 44% when irinotecan was administered 5 days after the last of 7 daily doses of STIVARGA. Effect of Regorafenib on BCRP Substrates: Administration of regorafenib (160 mg for 14 days) prior to administration of a single dose of rosuvastatin (5 mg), a BCRP substrate, resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in mean exposure (AUC) of rosuvastatin and a 4.6-fold increase in Cmax [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]."

Animal Data In 28-day repeat-dose studies in rats there were dose-dependent findings of dentin alteration and angiectasis. These findings occurred at regorafenib doses as low as 4 mg/kg (approximately 25% of the AUC in humans at the recommended dose). In 13-week repeat-dose studies in dogs there were similar findings of dentin alteration at doses as low as 20 mg/kg (approximately 43% of the AUC in humans at the recommended dose). Administration of regorafenib in these animals also led to persistent growth and thickening of the femoral epiphyseal growth plate."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, STIVARGA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on STIVARGA use in pregnant women. Administration of regorafenib was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended dose, with increased incidences of cardiovascular, genitourinary, and skeletal malformations [see Data]. Advise pregnant women of the potential hazard to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, a total loss of pregnancy (100% resorption of litter) was observed in rats at doses as low as 1 mg/kg (approximately 6% of the recommended human dose, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at doses as low as 1.6 mg/kg (approximately 25% of the human exposure at the clinically recommended dose measured by AUC). In a single dose distribution study in pregnant rats, there was increased penetration of regorafenib across the blood-brain barrier in fetuses compared to dams. Daily administration of regorafenib to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal findings of delayed ossification at doses > 0.8 mg/kg (approximately 5% of the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and dose-dependent increases in skeletal malformations including cleft palate and enlarged fontanelle at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg (approximately 10% of the clinical exposure based on AUC). At doses ≥ 1.6 mg/kg (approximately 11% of the recommended human dose based on body surface area), there were dose-dependent increases in the incidence of cardiovascular malformations, external abnormalities, diaphragmatic hernia, and dilation of the renal pelvis. In pregnant rabbits administered regorafenib daily during organogenesis, there were findings of ventricular septal defects evident at the lowest tested dose of 0.4 mg/kg (approximately 7% of the AUC in patients at the recommended dose). At doses of ≥ 0.8 mg/kg (approximately 15% of the human exposure at the recommended human dose based on AUC), administration of regorafenib resulted in dose-dependent increases in the incidence of additional cardiovascular malformations and skeletal anomalies, as well as significant adverse effects on the urinary system including missing kidney/ureter; small, deformed and malpositioned kidney; and hydronephrosis. The proportion of viable fetuses that were male decreased with increasing dose in two rabbit embryo-fetal toxicity studies."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests. Withhold and then reduce or discontinue STIVARGA based on severity and duration. (5.1) • Infections: Withhold STIVARGA in patients with worsening or severe infections. (5.2) • Hemorrhage: Permanently discontinue STIVARGA for severe or life-threatening hemorrhage. (5.3) • Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula: Discontinue STIVARGA. (5.4) • Dermatologic toxicity: Withhold and then reduce or discontinue STIVARGA depending on severity and persistence of dermatologic toxicity. (5.5) • Hypertension: Temporarily or permanently withhold STIVARGA for severe or uncontrolled hypertension. (5.6) • Cardiac ischemia and infarction: Withhold STIVARGA for new or acute cardiac ischemia/infarction and resume only after resolution of acute ischemic events. (5.7) • Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS): Discontinue STIVARGA. (5.8) • Wound healing complications: Discontinue STIVARGA before surgery. Discontinue in patients with wound dehiscence. (5.9) • Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 months after the final dose. Advise males to use effective contraception for 2 months after the final dose. (5.10, 8.1 , 8.3) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Severe drug-induced liver injury with fatal outcome occurred in STIVARGA-treated patients in clinical trials. In most cases, liver dysfunction occurred within the first 2 months of therapy and was characterized by a hepatocellular pattern of injury. In the CORRECT study, fatal hepatic failure occurred in 1.6% of patients in the regorafenib arm and in 0.4% of patients in the placebo arm. In the GRID study, fatal hepatic failure occurred in 0.8% of patients in the regorafenib arm. In the RESORCE study, there was no increase in the incidence of fatal hepatic failure as compared to placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Obtain liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) before initiation of STIVARGA and monitor at least every two weeks during the first 2 months of treatment. Thereafter, monitor monthly or more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor liver function tests weekly in patients experiencing elevated liver function tests until improvement to less than 3 times the ULN or baseline. Temporarily hold and then reduce or permanently discontinue STIVARGA depending on the severity and persistence of hepatotoxicity as manifested by elevated liver function tests or hepatocellular necrosis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.2 Infections STIVARGA caused an increased risk of infections. The overall incidence of infection (Grades 1-5) was higher (32% vs. 17%) in 1142 STIVARGA-treated patients as compared to the control arm in randomized placebo‑controlled trials.The incidence of grade 3 or greater infections in STIVARGA treated patients was 9%. The most common infections were urinary tract infections (5.7%), nasopharyngitis (4.0%), mucocutaneous and systemic fungal infections (3.3%) and pneumonia (2.6%). Fatal outcomes caused by infection occurred more often in patients treated with STIVARGA (1.0%) as compared to patients receiving placebo (0.3%); the most common fatal infections were respiratory (0.6% in STIVARGA-treated patients vs 0.2% in patients receiving placebo). Withhold STIVARGA for Grade 3 or 4 infections, or worsening infection of any grade. Resume STIVARGA at the same dose following resolution of infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Hemorrhage STIVARGA caused an increased incidence of hemorrhage. The overall incidence (Grades 1-5) was 18.2% in 1142 patients treated with STIVARGA and 9.5% in patients receiving placebo in randomized, placebo‑controlled trials. The incidence of grade 3 or greater hemorrhage in patients treated with STIVARGA was 3.0%. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic events was 0.7%, involving the central nervous system or the respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tracts. Permanently discontinue STIVARGA in patients with severe or life-threatening hemorrhage. Monitor INR levels more frequently in patients receiving warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Gastrointestinal Perforation or Fistula Gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 0.6% of 4518 patients treated with STIVARGA across all clinical trials of STIVARGA administered as a single agent; this included eight fatal events. Gastrointestinal fistula occurred in 0.8% of patients treated with STIVARGA and 0.2% of patients in placebo arm across randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Permanently discontinue STIVARGA in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. 5.5 Dermatologic Toxicity In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, adverse skin reactions occurred in 71.9% of patients in the regorafenib arm and in 25.5% of patients in the placebo arm, including hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES), and severe rash requiring dose modification. In the randomized, placebo-controlled trials, the overall incidence of HFSR was higher in 1142 STIVARGA-treated patients (53%) than in the placebo-treated patients (8%). Most cases of HFSR in STIVARGA-treated patients appeared during the first cycle of treatment. The incidences of Grade 3 HFSR (16% versus <1%), Grade 3 rash (3% versus <1%), serious adverse reactions of erythema multiforme (<0.1% vs. 0%) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (<0.1% vs. 0%) were also higher in STIVARGA-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Across all trials, a higher incidence of HFSR was observed in Asian patients treated with STIVARGA (all grades: 72%; Grade 3: 18%) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8 )]. Toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in 0.02% of 4518 STIVARGA-treated patients across all clinical trials of STIVARGA administered as a single agent. Withhold STIVARGA, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue STIVARGA depending on the severity and persistence of dermatologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Institute supportive measures for symptomatic relief. 5.6 Hypertension In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, hypertensive crisis occurred in 0.2% of patients in the regorafenib arms and in none of the patients in the placebo arms. STIVARGA caused an increased incidence of hypertension (30% versus 8% in CORRECT, 59% versus 27% in GRID, and 31% versus 6% in RESORCE) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]. The onset of hypertension occurred during the first cycle of treatment in most patients who developed hypertension (67% in randomized, placebo-controlled trials). Do not initiate STIVARGA unless blood pressure is adequately controlled. Monitor blood pressure weekly for the first 6 weeks of treatment and then every cycle, or more frequently, as clinically indicated. Temporarily or permanently withhold STIVARGA for severe or uncontrolled hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.7 Cardiac Ischemia and Infarction STIVARGA increased the incidence of myocardial ischemia and infarction (0.9% vs 0.2%) in randomized placebo-controlled trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Withhold STIVARGA in patients who develop new or acute onset cardiac ischemia or infarction. Resume STIVARGA only after resolution of acute cardiac ischemic events, if the potential benefits outweigh the risks of further cardiac ischemia. 5.8 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic finding on MRI, occurred in one of 4800 STIVARGA-treated patients across all clinical trials. Perform an evaluation for RPLS in any patient presenting with seizures, severe headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Discontinue STIVARGA in patients who develop RPLS. 5.9 Wound Healing Complications No formal studies of the effect of regorafenib on wound healing have been conducted. Since vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors such as STIVARGA can impair wound healing, discontinue treatment with STIVARGA at least 2 weeks prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume STIVARGA after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. Discontinue STIVARGA in patients with wound dehiscence. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, STIVARGA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on STIVARGA use in pregnant women. Regorafenib was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended dose, with increased incidences of cardiovascular, genitourinary, and skeletal malformations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with STIVARGA and for 2 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with STIVARGA and for 2 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.3)]."

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to STIVARGA in more than 4800 patients who were enrolled in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n=1142), an expanded access program (CONSIGN, n=2864), or single arm clinical trials (single agent or in combination with other agents). There were 4518 patients who received STIVARGA as a single agent; the distribution of underlying malignancies was 80% CRC, 4% GIST, 10% HCC, 6% other solid tumors; and 74% were White, 11% Asian, and 15% race not known. Among these 4518 patients, 83% received STIVARGA for at least 21 days and 20% received STIVARGA for 6 months or longer. In randomized placebo-controlled trials (CORRECT, GRID, RESORCE and CONCUR), the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (≥20%) in patients receiving STIVARGA are pain (including gastrointestinal and abdominal pain), HFSR, asthenia/fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite/food intake, hypertension, infection, dysphonia, hyperbilirubinemia, fever, mucositis, weight loss, rash, and nausea. Colorectal Cancer The safety data described below, except where noted, are derived from a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (CORRECT) in which 500 patients (median age 61 years; 61% men) with previously-treated metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) received STIVARGA as a single agent at the dose of 160 mg daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week treatment cycle and 253 patients (median age 61 years; 60% men) received placebo. The median duration of therapy was 1.7 months (range 2 days, 10.8 months) for patients receiving STIVARGA. Due to adverse reactions, 61% of the patients receiving STIVARGA required a dose interruption and 38% of the patients had their dose reduced. Adverse reactions that resulted in treatment discontinuation occurred in 8.2% of STIVARGA-treated patients compared to 1.2% of patients who received placebo. Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and rash were the most common reasons for permanent discontinuation of STIVARGA. Table 1 provides the incidence of adverse reactions (≥10%) in patients in CORRECT.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to the mother. (8.3) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, STIVARGA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on STIVARGA use in pregnant women. Administration of regorafenib was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended dose, with increased incidences of cardiovascular, genitourinary, and skeletal malformations [see Data]. Advise pregnant women of the potential hazard to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, a total loss of pregnancy (100% resorption of litter) was observed in rats at doses as low as 1 mg/kg (approximately 6% of the recommended human dose, based on body surface area) and in rabbits at doses as low as 1.6 mg/kg (approximately 25% of the human exposure at the clinically recommended dose measured by AUC). In a single dose distribution study in pregnant rats, there was increased penetration of regorafenib across the blood-brain barrier in fetuses compared to dams. Daily administration of regorafenib to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal findings of delayed ossification at doses > 0.8 mg/kg (approximately 5% of the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and dose-dependent increases in skeletal malformations including cleft palate and enlarged fontanelle at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg (approximately 10% of the clinical exposure based on AUC). At doses ≥ 1.6 mg/kg (approximately 11% of the recommended human dose based on body surface area), there were dose-dependent increases in the incidence of cardiovascular malformations, external abnormalities, diaphragmatic hernia, and dilation of the renal pelvis. In pregnant rabbits administered regorafenib daily during organogenesis, there were findings of ventricular septal defects evident at the lowest tested dose of 0.4 mg/kg (approximately 7% of the AUC in patients at the recommended dose). At doses of ≥ 0.8 mg/kg (approximately 15% of the human exposure at the recommended human dose based on AUC), administration of regorafenib resulted in dose-dependent increases in the incidence of additional cardiovascular malformations and skeletal anomalies, as well as significant adverse effects on the urinary system including missing kidney/ureter; small, deformed and malpositioned kidney; and hydronephrosis. The proportion of viable fetuses that were male decreased with increasing dose in two rabbit embryo-fetal toxicity studies. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of regorafenib or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of regorafenib on the breastfed infant, or on milk production. In rats, regorafenib and its metabolites are excreted in milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from STIVARGA, do not breastfeed during treatment with STIVARGA and for 2 weeks after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females Use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 months after completion of therapy. Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 months following the final dose of STIVARGA [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Infertility There are no data on the effect of STIVARGA on human fertility. Results from animal studies indicate that regorafenib can impair male and female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of STIVARGA in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. Animal Data In 28-day repeat-dose studies in rats there were dose-dependent findings of dentin alteration and angiectasis. These findings occurred at regorafenib doses as low as 4 mg/kg (approximately 25% of the AUC in humans at the recommended dose). In 13-week repeat-dose studies in dogs there were similar findings of dentin alteration at doses as low as 20 mg/kg (approximately 43% of the AUC in humans at the recommended dose). Administration of regorafenib in these animals also led to persistent growth and thickening of the femoral epiphyseal growth plate. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1142 STIVARGA-treated patients enrolled in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, 40% were 65 years of age and over, while 10% were 75 and over. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients. There was an increased incidence of Grade 3 hypertension (18% versus 9%) in the placebo-controlled trials among STIVARGA-treated patients 65 years of age and older as compared to younger patients. In addition, one Grade 4 hypertension event has been reported in the 65 years and older age group and none in the younger age group. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (total bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN, or total bilirubin >ULN to ≤1.5 times ULN) or moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to ≤3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment, [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Closely monitor patients with hepatic impairment for adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. STIVARGA is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3x ULN) as STIVARGA has not been studied in this population. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib have not been studied in patients who are on dialysis and there is no recommended dose for this patient population [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Race Based on pooled data from three placebo-controlled trials (CORRECT, GRID and CONCUR), a higher incidence of HFSR and liver function test abnormalities occurred in Asian patients treated with STIVARGA as compared with Whites [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5)]. No starting dose adjustment is necessary based on race."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Colorectal Cancer The clinical efficacy and safety of STIVARGA were evaluated in an international, multicenter, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [Study “Patients with metastatic COloRectal cancer treated with REgorafenib or plaCebo after failure of standard Therapy” (CORRECT); NCT 01103323)] in 760 patients with previously-treated metastatic colorectal cancer. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS); additional efficacy outcome measures included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall tumor response rate. Patients were randomized to receive 160 mg regorafenib orally once daily (N=505) plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo (N=255) plus BSC for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle. STIVARGA was administered with a low-fat breakfast that contains less than 30% fat [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Baseline demographics were: median age 61 years, 61% men, 78% White, and all patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The primary sites of disease were colon (65%), rectum (29%), or both (6%). History of KRAS evaluation was reported for 729 (96%) patients; 430 (59%) of these patients were reported to have KRAS mutation. The median number of prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease was 3. All patients received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and with bevacizumab. All but one patient with KRAS mutation-negative tumors received panitumumab or cetuximab. The addition of STIVARGA to BSC resulted in a statistically significant improvement in survival compared to placebo plus BSC (see Table 7 and Figure 1).

Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival Stivarga GIST USPI Figure 1 v3 14.2 Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors The efficacy and safety of STIVARGA were evaluated in an international, multicenter, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [Study “GIST Regorafenib In progressive Disease” (GRID); NCT 01271712] in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), who had been previously treated with imatinib mesylate and sunitinib malate. Randomization was stratified by line of therapy (third vs. four or more) and geographic region (Asia vs. rest of the world). The major efficacy outcome measure of GRID was progression-free survival (PFS) based on disease assessment by independent radiological review using modified RECIST 1.1 criteria, in which lymph nodes and bone lesions were not target lesions and progressively growing new tumor nodule within a pre-existing tumor mass was progression. The key secondary outcome measure was overall survival. Patients were randomized to receive 160 mg regorafenib orally once daily (N=133) plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo (N=66) plus BSC for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In GRID, the median age of patients was 60 years, 64% were men, 68% were White, and all patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (55%) or 1 (45%). At the time of disease progression as assessed by central review, the study blind was broken and all patients were offered the opportunity to take STIVARGA at the investigator’s discretion. A statistically significant improvement in PFS was demonstrated among patients treated with STIVARGA compared to placebo (see Table 8 and Figure 2). There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival at the final OS analysis, conducted at 162 OS events (Table 8). Cross-over to open label STIVARGA occurred in 58 (88%) placebo-treated patients after disease progression.

Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Curves of Progression-Free Survival for GRID Stivarga GIST USPI Figure 2 v3 14.3 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) The clinical efficacy and safety of STIVARGA were evaluated in an international, multicenter, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [Study “REgorafenib after SORafenib in patients with hepatoCEllular carcinoma” (RESORCE); NCT 01774344]. The study enrolled adults with Child-Pugh A and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage Category B or C hepatocellular carcinoma, with documented disease progression following sorafenib. The median duration of previous sorafenib treatment was 7.8 months; patients who permanently discontinued sorafenib due to toxicity or were unable to tolerate sorafenib doses of 400 mg once daily were ineligible. Patients were randomized to receive 160 mg regorafenib orally once daily plus best supportive care (BSC) or matching placebo plus BSC for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by geographical region (Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), alpha-fetoprotein levels (<400 ng/mL vs ≥400 ng/mL), extrahepatic disease (presence vs absence), and macrovascular invasion (presence vs absence). The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Additional outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS), overall tumor response rate (ORR) and duration of response as assessed by investigators using RECIST 1.1 and using modified RECIST (mRECIST) for HCC. Patients continued therapy with STIVARGA until clinical or radiological disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The characteristics of the study population were a median age of 63 years (range 19 to 85 years); 88% male; 41% Asian, 36% White, and 21% not reported; 66% had ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 and 34% had ECOG PS of 1; 98% had Child-Pugh A and 2% had Child-Pugh B. Risk factors for underlying cirrhosis included hepatitis B (38%), alcohol use (25%), hepatitis C (21%), and non-alcoholic steato hepatitis (7%). Macroscopic vascular invasion or extra-hepatic tumor spread was present in 81% of patients. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) was stage C in 87% and stage B in 13% of patients. All patients received prior sorafenib and 61% received prior loco-regional transarterial embolization or chemoinfusion procedures. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 9 and Figure 3 below.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Regorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane-bound and intracellular kinases involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, metastasis and tumor immunity. In in vitro biochemical or cellular assays, regorafenib or its major human active metabolites M-2 and M-5 inhibited the activity of RET, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2, DDR2, TrkA, Eph2A, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAF V600E, SAPK2, PTK5, Abl and CSF1R at concentrations of regorafenib that have been achieved clinically. In in vivo models, regorafenib demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity in a rat tumor model and inhibition of tumor growth in several mouse xenograft models including some for human colorectal carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal and hepatocellular carcinoma. Regorafenib also demonstrated anti-metastatic activity in a mouse xenograft model and two mouse orthotopic models of human colorectal carcinoma. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of multiple doses of STIVARGA (160 mg once daily for 21 days) on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm study in 25 patients with advanced solid tumors. No large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e., > 20 msec) were detected in the study. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single 160 mg dose of STIVARGA in patients with advanced solid tumors, regorafenib reaches a geometric mean peak plasma level (Cmax) of 2.5 µg/mL at a median time of 4 hours and a geometric mean area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) of 70.4 µg*h/mL. The AUC of regorafenib at steady-state increases less than dose proportionally at doses greater than 60 mg. At steady-state, regorafenib reaches a geometric mean Cmax of 3.9 µg/mL and a geometric mean AUC of 58.3 µg*h/mL. The coefficient of variation of AUC and Cmax is between 35% and 44%. The mean relative bioavailability of tablets compared to an oral solution is 69% to 83%. In a food-effect study, 24 healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of STIVARGA on three separate occasions: under a fasted state, with a high-fat meal and with a low-fat meal. A high-fat meal (945 calories and 54.6 g fat) increased the mean AUC of regorafenib by 48% and decreased the mean AUC of the M-2 and M-5 metabolites by 20% and 51%, respectively, as compared to the fasted state. A low-fat meal (319 calories and 8.2 g fat) increased the mean AUC of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 by 36%, 40% and 23%, respectively as compared to fasted conditions. STIVARGA was administered with a low-fat meal in the CORRECT and GRID studies [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Distribution Regorafenib undergoes enterohepatic circulation with multiple plasma concentration peaks observed across the 24-hour dosing interval. Regorafenib is highly bound (99.5%) to human plasma proteins. Elimination Following a single 160 mg oral dose of STIVARGA, the geometric mean (minimum to maximum) elimination half-lives for regorafenib and the M-2 metabolite in plasma are 28 hours (14 to 58 hours) and 25 hours (14 to 32 hours), respectively. M-5 has a longer mean (minimum to maximum) elimination half-life of 51 hours (32 to 70 hours). Metabolism Regorafenib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and UGT1A9. The main circulating metabolites of regorafenib measured at steady-state in human plasma are M-2 (N-oxide) and M-5 (N-oxide and N-desmethyl). Both metabolites have similar in vitro pharmacological activity and steady-state concentrations as regorafenib. M-2 and M-5 are highly protein bound (99.8% and 99.95%, respectively). Excretion Approximately 71% of a radiolabeled dose was excreted in feces (47% as parent compound, 24% as metabolites) and 19% of the dose was excreted in urine (17% as glucuronides) within 12 days after administration of a radiolabeled oral solution at a dose of 120 mg. Specific Populations Age, sex, race and weight had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of regorafenib. Hepatic Impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically important differences in the mean total exposure of regorafenib, including M-2 and M-5, were noted amongst patients with normal liver function (total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN, n=744), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST >ULN or total bilirubin >ULN to ≤1.5x ULN, n=437), and moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5x to ≤3x ULN and any AST, n=36). The pooled analysis included 391 patients with HCC of whom 116, 249, and 26 were categorized as having normal liver function, mild, and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib were not evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3x ULN). Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, M-2, and M-5 was evaluated in 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min) and 18 patients with normal/mild renal function (CLcr ≥60 mL/min) following the administration of STIVARGA at a dose of 160 mg daily for 21 days. No differences in the mean steady-state exposure of regorafenib, M-2, or M-5 were observed in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Regorafenib on Cytochrome P450 Substrates: In vitro studies suggested that regorafenib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19; M-2 is an inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and M-5 is an inhibitor of CYP2C8. In vitro studies suggested that regorafenib is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme activity. Patients with advanced solid tumors received single oral doses of CYP substrates, 2 mg of midazolam (CYP3A4), 40 mg of omeprazole (CYP2C19) and 10 mg of warfarin (CYP2C9) or 4 mg of rosiglitazone (CYP2C8) one week before and two weeks after STIVARGA at a dose of 160 mg once daily. No clinically meaningful effect was observed in the mean AUC of rosiglitazone (N=12) or the mean omeprazole (N=11) plasma concentrations measured 6 hours after dosing or the mean AUC of midazolam (N=15). The mean AUC of warfarin (N=8) increased by 25% [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Effect of CYP3A4 Strong Inducers on Regorafenib: Twenty-two healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of STIVARGA alone and then 7 days after starting rifampin. Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, was administered at a dose of 600 mg daily for 9 days. The mean AUC of regorafenib decreased by 50% and mean AUC of M-5 increased by 264%. No change in the mean AUC of M-2 was observed [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Effect of CYP3A4 Strong Inhibitors on Regorafenib: Eighteen healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of STIVARGA alone and then 5 days after starting ketoconazole. Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, was administered at a dose of 400 mg daily for 18 days. The mean AUC of regorafenib increased by 33% and the mean AUC of M-2 and M-5 both decreased by 93% [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Effect of Neomycin on Regorafenib: Twenty-seven healthy men received a single 160 mg dose of STIVARGA and then 5 days after starting neomycin. Neomycin, a non-absorbable antibiotic, was administered at a dose of 1 gram three times daily for 5 days. No clinically meaningful effect on the mean AUC of regorafenib was observed; however, the mean AUC of M-2 decreased by 76% and the mean AUC of M-5 decreased by 86%. The decreased exposure of M-2 and M-5 may result in a decreased efficacy of STIVARGA. The effects of other antibiotics on the exposure of regorafenib and its active metabolites have not been studied. Effect of Regorafenib on UGT1A1 Substrates: In vitro studies showed that regorafenib, M-2, and M-5 competitively inhibit UGT1A9 and UGT1A1 at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Eleven patients received irinotecan-containing combination chemotherapy with STIVARGA at a dose of 160 mg. The mean AUC of irinotecan increased by 28% and the mean AUC of SN-38 increased by 44% when irinotecan was administered 5 days after the last of 7 daily doses of STIVARGA. Effect of Regorafenib on BCRP Substrates: Administration of regorafenib (160 mg for 14 days) prior to administration of a single dose of rosuvastatin (5 mg), a BCRP substrate, resulted in a 3.8-fold increase in mean exposure (AUC) of rosuvastatin and a 4.6-fold increase in Cmax [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies examining the carcinogenic potential of regorafenib have not been conducted. Regorafenib itself did not demonstrate genotoxicity in in vitro or in vivo assays; however, a major human active metabolite of regorafenib, (M-2), was positive for clastogenicity, causing chromosome aberration in Chinese hamster V79 cells. Dedicated studies to examine the effects of regorafenib on fertility have not been conducted; however, there were histological findings of tubular atrophy and degeneration in the testes, atrophy in the seminal vesicle, and cellular debris and oligospermia in the epididymides in male rats at doses similar to those in human at the clinical recommended dose based on AUC. In female rats, there were increased findings of necrotic corpora lutea in the ovaries at the same exposures. There were similar findings in dogs of both sexes in repeat dose studies at exposures approximately 83% of the human exposure at the recommended human dose based on AUC. These findings suggest that regorafenib may adversely affect fertility in humans."
