      "nonclinical_toxicology": [
        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with olaparib. Olaparib was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary pharmacology of olaparib and indicates potential for genotoxicity in humans. Olaparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test. In a fertility study, female rats received oral olaparib at doses of 0.05, 0.5, and 15 mg/kg/day for at least 14 days before mating through the first week of pregnancy. There were no adverse effects on mating and fertility rates at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (maternal systemic exposures approximately 7% of the human exposure (AUC 0-24h ) at the recommended dose). In a male fertility study, olaparib had no effect on mating and fertility in rats at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg/day following at least 70 days of olaparib treatment (with systemic exposures of approximately 5% of the human exposure (AUC 0-24h ) at the recommended dose)."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Olaparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, including PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3. PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular functions, such as DNA transcription and DNA repair. Olaparib has been shown to inhibit growth of select tumor cell lines in vitro and decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer, both as monotherapy or following platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity following treatment with olaparib were noted in cell lines and mouse tumor models with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 , ATM , or other genes involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA damage and correlated with platinum response. In vitro studies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes, resulting in DNA damage and cancer cell death."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The area under the curve (AUC) of olaparib increases approximately proportionally following administration of single doses of 25 mg to 450 mg (0.08 to 1.5 times the recommended dose) and maximal concentrations (C max ) increased slightly less than proportionally for the same dose range. Olaparib showed time-dependent pharmacokinetics and an AUC mean accumulation ratio of 1.8 is observed at steady state following a dose of 300 mg twice daily. The mean (CV%) olaparib C max is 5.4 μg/mL (32%) and AUC is 39.2 μg*h/mL (44%) following a single 300 mg dose. The mean steady state olaparib C max and AUC is 7.6 μg/mL (35%) and 49.2 μg*h/mL (44%), following a dose of 300 mg twice daily. Absorption Following oral administration of olaparib, the median time to peak plasma concentration is 1.5 hours. Effect of Food Co-administration of a high fat and high calorie meal (800-1000 kcal, 50% of the calorie content made up from fat) with olaparib slowed the rate (t max delayed by 2.5 hours) of absorption, but did not significantly alter the extent of olaparib absorption (mean AUC increased by approximately 8%). Distribution The mean (± standard deviation) apparent volume of distribution of olaparib is 158 ± 136 L following a single 300 mg dose of Lynparza. The protein binding of olaparib is approximately 82% in vitro. Elimination The mean (± standard deviation) terminal plasma half-life of olaparib is 14.9 ± 8.2 hours and the apparent plasma clearance is 7.4 ± 3.9 L/h following a single 300 mg dose of Lynparza. Metabolism Olaparib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A in vitro. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled olaparib to female patients, unchanged olaparib accounted for 70% of the circulating radioactivity in plasma. It was extensively metabolized with unchanged drug accounting for 15% and 6% of radioactivity in urine and feces, respectively. The majority of the metabolism is attributable to oxidation reactions with a number of the components produced undergoing subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. Excretion Following a single dose of radiolabeled olaparib, 86% of the dosed radioactivity was recovered within a 7-day collection period, 44% via the urine and 42% via the feces. The majority of the material was excreted as metabolites. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment In a renal impairment trial, the mean AUC increased by 24% and C max by 15%, when olaparib was dosed in patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr=51-80 mL/min defined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation; n=13) and by 44% and 26%, respectively, when olaparib was dosed in patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr=31-50 mL/min; n=13), compared to those with normal renal function (CLcr ≥81 mL/min; n=12). There was no evidence of a relationship between the extent of plasma protein binding of olaparib and creatinine clearance. There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (CLcr ≤30 mL/min). Patients with Hepatic Impairment In a hepatic impairment trial, the mean AUC increased by 15% and the mean C max increased by 13% when olaparib was dosed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification A; n=10) and the mean AUC increased by 8% and the mean C max decreased by 13% when olaparib was dosed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification B; n=8), compared to patients with normal hepatic function (n=13). Hepatic impairment has no effect on the protein binding of olaparib and, therefore, total plasma exposure was representative of free drug. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C). Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies CYP3A Inhibitors: Concomitant use of itraconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) increased olaparib C max by 42% and AUC by 170%. Concomitant use of fluconazole (moderate CYP3A inhibitor) is predicted to increase olaparib C max by 14% and AUC by 121%. CYP3A Inducers : Concomitant use of rifampicin (strong CYP3A inducer) decreased olaparib C max by 71% and AUC by 87%. Concomitant use of efavirenz (moderate CYP3A inducer) is predicted to decrease olaparib C max by 31% and AUC by 60%. In vitro Studies CYP Enzymes : Olaparib is both an inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A and an inducer of CYP2B6. Olaparib is predicted to be a weak CYP3A inhibitor in humans. UGT Enzymes : Olaparib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. Transporters : Olaparib is an inhibitor of BCRP, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, MATE1, and MATE2K. Olaparib is a substrate and inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-gp. The potential for olaparib to induce P-gp has not been evaluated."

        "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lynparza is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor indicated: Ovarian cancer • for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA -mutated advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Lynparza. ( 1.1 , 2.1 ) • in combination with bevacizumab for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and whose cancer is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive status defined by either: • a deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA mutation, and/or • genomic instability. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Lynparza ( 1.2 , 2.1 ). • for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, who are in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. (1.3) • for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA -mutated (g BRCA m) advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Lynparza. ( 1.4 , 2.1 ) Breast cancer • for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious g BRCA m, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should have been treated with a prior endocrine therapy or be considered inappropriate for endocrine therapy. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Lynparza. ( 1.5 , 2.1 ) Pancreatic cancer • for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious g BRCA m metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose disease has not progressed on at least 16 weeks of a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Lynparza. ( 1.6 , 2.1 ) Prostate cancer • for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Lynparza. ( 1.7 , 2.1 ) 1.1 First-Line Maintenance Treatment of BRCA -mutated Advanced Ovarian Cancer Lynparza is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA -mutated advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

In an animal reproduction study, the administration of olaparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and embryo-fetal toxicity at exposures below those in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 300 mg twice daily (see Data ). Apprise pregnant women of the potential hazard to the fetus and the potential risk for loss of the pregnancy. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The estimated background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2-4%; and the risk for spontaneous abortion is approximately 15-20% in clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats, olaparib was administered orally for 14 days before mating through to Day 6 of pregnancy, which resulted in increased post-implantation loss at a dose level of 15 mg/kg/day (with maternal systemic exposures approximately 7% of the human exposure (AUC 0-24h ) at the recommended dose). In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats received oral doses of 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg/day olaparib during the period of organogenesis. A dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day (with maternal systemic exposures approximately 0.18% of human exposure (AUC 0-24h ) at the recommended dose) caused embryo-fetal toxicities including increased post-implantation loss and major malformations of the eyes (anophthalmia, microphthalmia), vertebrae/ribs (extra rib or ossification center; fused or absent neural arches, ribs, and sternebrae), skull (fused exoccipital), and diaphragm (hernia). Additional abnormalities or variants included incomplete or absent ossification (vertebrae/sternebrae, ribs, limbs) and other findings in the vertebrae/sternebrae, pelvic girdle, lung, thymus, liver, ureter, and umbilical artery. Some findings noted above in the eyes, ribs, and ureter were observed at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day olaparib at lower incidence."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to Lynparza monotherapy and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. Monitor patients for hematological toxicity at baseline and monthly thereafter. Discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed. (5.1) • Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to Lynparza, and some cases were fatal. Interrupt treatment if pneumonitis is suspected. Discontinue if pneumonitis is confirmed. (5.2) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) • Venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism occurred in 7% of patients with mCRPC. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) has occurred in patients treated with Lynparza and some cases were fatal. In clinical studies enrolling 2901 patients with various cancers who received Lynparza as a single agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , the cumulative incidence of MDS/AML was approximately 1.5% (43/2901). Of these, 51% (22/43) had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy with Lynparza in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: < 6 months to > 10 years). All of these patients had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy. Do not start Lynparza until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤ Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt Lynparza and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue Lynparza. 5.2 Pneumonitis In clinical studies enrolling 2901 patients with various cancers who received Lynparza as a single agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , the incidence of pneumonitis, including fatal cases, was 0.8% (24/2901). If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt Lynparza treatment and promptly assess the source of the symptoms. If pneumonitis is confirmed, discontinue Lynparza treatment and treat the patient appropriately. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Lynparza can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. In an animal reproduction study, administration of olaparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and embryo-fetal toxicity at exposures below those in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 300 mg twice daily. Apprise pregnant women of the potential hazard to a fetus and the potential risk for loss of the pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of Lynparza. Based on findings from genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of Lynparza [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5.4 Venous Thromboembolic Events Venous thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolism, occurred in 7% of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who received Lynparza plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to 3.1% of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study. Patients receiving Lynparza and ADT had a 6% incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to 0.8% of patients treated with ADT plus either enzalutamide or abiraterone. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated."

(2.2) • Patients receiving Lynparza for mCRPC should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. (2.2) • For moderate renal impairment (CLcr 31-50 mL/min), reduce Lynparza dosage to 200 mg orally twice daily. (2.5) 2.1 Patient Selection Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of genetic mutations is available at http://www.fda.gov/companiondiagnostics . Select patients for treatment with Lynparza based on the presence of deleterious or suspected deleterious HRR gene mutations, including BRCA mutations, or genomic instability based on the indication, biomarker, and sample type (Table 1). Table 1 Biomarker Testing for Patient Selection Where testing fails or tissue sample is unavailable/insufficient, or when germline testing is negative, consider using an alternative test, if available. Indication Biomarker Sample type Tumor Blood Plasma (ctDNA) First-line maintenance treatment of germline or somatic BRCAm advanced ovarian cancer BRCA1 m, BRCA2 m X X First-line maintenance treatment of HRD-positive advanced ovarian cancer in combination with bevacizumab BRCA1 m, BRC A2m and/or genomic instability X Maintenance treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer No requirement for biomarker testing Advanced g BRCA m ovarian cancer gBRCA1 m, gBRCA2 m X g BRCA m HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer gBRCA1 m, gBRCA2 m X First-line maintenance treatment of germline BRCA -mutated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma gBRCA1 m, gBRCA2 m X Germline or somatic HRR gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ATM m, BRCA1 m , BRCA2 m, BARD1 m, BRIP1 m, CDK12 m, CHEK1 m, CHEK2 m, FANCL m, PALB2 m, RAD51B m, RAD51C m, RAD51D m, RAD54L m X g BRCA1 m, g BRCA2 m X ATM m , BRCA1 m, BRCA2 m X 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of Lynparza is 300 mg taken orally twice daily, with or without food. If a patient misses a dose of Lynparza, instruct patient to take their next dose at its scheduled time. Instruct patients to swallow tablets whole. Do not chew, crush, dissolve, or divide tablet. First-Line Maintenance Treatment of BRCA -mutated Advanced Ovarian Cancer Continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of 2 years of treatment. Patients with a complete response (no radiological evidence of disease) at 2 years should stop treatment. Patients with evidence of disease at 2 years, who in the opinion of the treating healthcare provider can derive further benefit from continuous treatment, can be treated beyond 2 years. First-Line Maintenance Treatment of HRD-positive Advanced Ovarian Cancer in Combination with Bevacizumab Continue Lynparza treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of 2 years of treatment. Patients with a complete response (no radiological evidence of disease) at 2 years should stop treatment. Patients with evidence of disease at 2 years, who in the opinion of the treating healthcare provider can derive further benefit from continuous Lynparza treatment, can be treated beyond 2 years. When used with Lynparza, the recommended dose of bevacizumab is 15 mg/kg every three weeks. Bevacizumab should be given for a total of 15 months including the period given with chemotherapy and given as maintenance. Refer to the Prescribing Information for bevacizumab when used in combination with Lynparza for more information. Recurrent Ovarian Cancer, Germline BRCA m Advanced Ovarian Cancer, HER2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer, Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, and HRR Gene-mutated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for: • Maintenance treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer • Advanced germline BRCA -mutated ovarian cancer • Germline BRCA -mutated HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer • First-line maintenance treatment of germline BRCA -mutated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. • HRR gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer Patients receiving Lynparza for mCRPC should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions To manage adverse reactions, consider interruption of treatment or dose reduction. The recommended dose reduction is 250 mg taken twice daily. If a further dose reduction is required, then reduce to 200 mg taken twice daily. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Concomitant Use with Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with Lynparza. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce Lynparza dosage to: • 100 mg twice daily when used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. • 150 mg twice daily when used concomitantly with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor. After the inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, resume the Lynparza dose taken prior to initiating the CYP3A inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Renal Impairment Moderate Renal Impairment In patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 31-50 mL/min), reduce the Lynparza dosage to 200 mg orally twice daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: • Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Venous Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Most common adverse reactions (≥10%) in clinical trials: • as a single agent were nausea, fatigue (including asthenia), anemia, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, headache, dysgeusia, cough, neutropenia, dyspnea, dizziness, dyspepsia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. (6.1) • in combination with bevacizumab were nausea, fatigue (including asthenia), anemia, lymphopenia, vomiting, diarrhea, neutropenia, leukopenia, urinary tract infection, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to Lynparza as a single agent in 2901 patients; 2135 patients with exposure to 300 mg twice daily tablet dose including five controlled, randomized, trials (SOLO-1, SOLO-2, OlympiAD, POLO, and PROfound) and to 400 mg twice daily capsule dose in 766 patients in other trials that were pooled to conduct safety analyses. In these trials, 56% of patients were exposed for 6 months or longer and 28% were exposed for greater than one year in the Lynparza group. In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions in ≥10% of patients were nausea (60%), fatigue (55%), anemia (36%), vomiting (32%), diarrhea (24%), decreased appetite (22%), headache (16%), dysgeusia (15%), cough (15%), neutropenia (14%), dyspnea (14%), dizziness (12%), dyspepsia (12%), leukopenia (11%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). First-Line Maintenance Treatment of BRCA -mutated Advanced Ovarian Cancer SOLO-1 The safety of Lynparza for the maintenance treatment of patients with BRCA -mutated advanced ovarian cancer following first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy was investigated in SOLO-1 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients received Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily (n=260) or placebo (n=130) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of study treatment was 25 months for patients who received Lynparza and 14 months for patients who received placebo. Among patients who received Lynparza, dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 52% and dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 28%. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption or reduction of Lynparza were anemia (23%), nausea (14%), and vomiting (10%). Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients receiving Lynparza. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of Lynparza were fatigue (3.1%), anemia (2.3%), and nausea (2.3%). Tables 2 and 3 summarize adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in SOLO-1.

This study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind study in which 802 patients received either Lynparza 300 mg BID in combination with bevacizumab (n=535) or placebo in combination with bevacizumab (n=267) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment with Lynparza was 17.3 months and 11 months for bevacizumab post-randomization on the Lynparza/bevacizumab arm. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1 patient due to concurrent pneumonia and aplastic anemia. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 31% of patients who received Lynparza/bevacizumab. Serious adverse reactions in >5% of patients included hypertension (19%) and anemia (17%). Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 54% of patients receiving Lynparza/bevacizumab and dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 41% of patients who received Lynparza/bevacizumab. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption in the Lynparza/bevacizumab arm were anemia (21%), nausea (7%), vomiting (3%), and fatigue (3%), and the most frequent adverse reactions leading to reduction in the Lynparza/bevacizumab arm were anemia (19%), nausea (7%), and fatigue (4%). Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving Lynparza/bevacizumab. Specific adverse reactions that most frequently led to discontinuation in patients treated with Lynparza/bevacizumab were anemia (4%) and nausea (3%).

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , Lynparza can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on Lynparza use in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In an animal reproduction study, the administration of olaparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and embryo-fetal toxicity at exposures below those in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 300 mg twice daily (see Data ). Apprise pregnant women of the potential hazard to the fetus and the potential risk for loss of the pregnancy. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The estimated background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2-4%; and the risk for spontaneous abortion is approximately 15-20% in clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats, olaparib was administered orally for 14 days before mating through to Day 6 of pregnancy, which resulted in increased post-implantation loss at a dose level of 15 mg/kg/day (with maternal systemic exposures approximately 7% of the human exposure (AUC 0-24h ) at the recommended dose). In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats received oral doses of 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg/day olaparib during the period of organogenesis. A dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day (with maternal systemic exposures approximately 0.18% of human exposure (AUC 0-24h ) at the recommended dose) caused embryo-fetal toxicities including increased post-implantation loss and major malformations of the eyes (anophthalmia, microphthalmia), vertebrae/ribs (extra rib or ossification center; fused or absent neural arches, ribs, and sternebrae), skull (fused exoccipital), and diaphragm (hernia). Additional abnormalities or variants included incomplete or absent ossification (vertebrae/sternebrae, ribs, limbs) and other findings in the vertebrae/sternebrae, pelvic girdle, lung, thymus, liver, ureter, and umbilical artery. Some findings noted above in the eyes, ribs, and ureter were observed at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day olaparib at lower incidence. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of olaparib in human milk, or on its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infants from Lynparza, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with Lynparza and for one month after receiving the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Recommend pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with Lynparza. Contraception Females Lynparza can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Lynparza and for at least 6 months following the last dose. Males Based on findings in genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of Lynparza. Advise male patients not to donate sperm during therapy and for 3 months following the last dose of Lynparza [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Lynparza have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2351 patients with advanced solid tumors who received Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily as monotherapy, 596 (25%) patients were aged ≥65 years, and this included 137 (6%) patients who were aged ≥75 years. Seven (0.3%) patients were aged ≥85 years. Of the 535 patients with advanced solid tumors who received Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily in combination with bevacizumab, 204 (38%) patients were aged ≥65 years, and this included 31 (6%) patients who were aged ≥75 years. No overall differences in the safety or effectiveness of Lynparza were observed between these patients and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage modification is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 51 to 80 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). Reduce Lynparza dosage to 200 mg twice daily in patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 31 to 50 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage disease (CLcr ≤30 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No adjustment to the starting dose is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification A and B). There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

Treatment was continued for up to 2 years or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity; however, patients with evidence of disease at 2 years, who in the opinion of the treating healthcare provider could derive further benefit from continuous treatment, could be treated beyond 2 years. Randomization was stratified by response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (complete or partial response). The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. A total of 391 patients were randomized, 260 to Lynparza and 131 to placebo. The median age of patients treated with Lynparza was 53 years (range: 29 to 82) and 53 years (range: 31 to 84) among patients on placebo. The ECOG performance status (PS) was 0 in 77% of patients receiving Lynparza and 80% of patients receiving placebo. Of all patients, 82% were White, 36% were enrolled in the U.S. or Canada, and 82% were in complete response to their most recent platinum-based regimen. The majority of patients (n=389) had germline BRCA mutation (g BRCA m), and 2 patients had somatic BRCA m (s BRCA m). Of the 391 patients randomized in SOLO-1, 386 were retrospectively or prospectively tested with a Myriad BRACAnalysis test and 383 patients were confirmed to have deleterious or suspected deleterious g BRCA m status; 253 were randomized to the Lynparza arm and 130 to the placebo arm. Two out of 391 patients randomized in SOLO-1 were confirmed to have s BRCA m based on an investigational Foundation Medicine tissue test. SOLO-1 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in investigator-assessed PFS for Lynparza compared to placebo. Results from a blinded independent review were consistent. At the time of the analysis of PFS, overall survival (OS) data were not mature (21% of patients had died). Efficacy results are presented in Table 18 and Figure 1.

Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier Curves of Investigator-Assessed Progression-Free Survival - SOLO-1 Figure 1 14.2 First-line Maintenance Treatment of HRD-positive Advanced Ovarian Cancer in Combination with Bevacizumab PAOLA-1 (NCT02477644) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial that compared the efficacy of Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab versus placebo/bevacizumab for the maintenance treatment of advanced high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Randomization was stratified by first-line treatment outcome (timing and outcome of cytoreductive surgery and response to platinum-based chemotherapy) and t BRCA m status, determined by prospective local testing. All available clinical samples were retrospectively tested with Myriad myChoice ® CDx. Patients were required to have no evidence of disease (NED) due to complete surgical resection, or who were in complete response (CR), or partial response (PR) following completion of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily in combination with bevacizumab (n=537) 15 mg/kg every three weeks or placebo/bevacizumab (n=269) Patients continued bevacizumab in the maintenance setting and started treatment with Lynparza after a minimum of 3 weeks and up to a maximum of 9 weeks following completion of their last dose of chemotherapy. Lynparza treatment was continued for up to 2 years or until progression of the underlying disease or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who in the opinion of the treating physician could derive further benefit from continuous treatment could be treated beyond 2 years. Treatment with bevacizumab was for a total of up to 15 months, including the period given with chemotherapy and given as maintenance. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST, version 1.1. An additional efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS). The median age of patients in both arms was 61 years overall (range 26 to 87). Ovarian cancer was the primary tumor type in 86% of patients in both arms. Ninety six percent (96%) were serous histological type. The ECOG performance score was 0 in 70% of patients and 1 in 28% of patients, overall. All patients had received first-line platinum-based therapy and bevacizumab. First-line treatment outcomes at screening indicated that patients had no evidence of disease with complete macroscopic resection at initial debulking surgery (32%, both arms), no evidence of disease/ CR with complete macroscopic resection at interval debulking surgery (31%, both arms), no evidence of disease/ CR in patients who had either incomplete resection (at initial or interval debulking surgery) or no debulking surgery (15%, both arms) and patients with a partial response (22%, both arms). Thirty percent (30%) of patients in both arms had a deleterious mutation. Patients were not restricted by the surgical outcome with 65% having complete cytoreduction at initial or interval debulking surgery and 35% having residual macroscopic disease. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the study and placebo arms in the Intention to Treat (ITT) population and also in the HRD-positive subgroup. Efficacy results from a biomarker subgroup analysis of 387 patients with HRD-positive tumors, identified post-randomization using the Myriad myChoice ® HRD Plus tumor test, who received Lynparza/bevacizumab (n=255) or placebo/bevacizumab (n=132), are summarized in Table 19 and Figure 2. Results from a blinded independent review of PFS were consistent. Overall survival data in this subpopulation were immature with 16% deaths.

SOLO-2 The efficacy of Lynparza was evaluated in SOLO-2 (NCT01874353), a randomized (2:1) double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with g BRCA m ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Patients were randomized to Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily or placebo until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease. Randomization was stratified by response to last platinum chemotherapy (complete versus partial) and time to disease progression in the penultimate platinum-based chemotherapy prior to enrollment (6-12 months versus >12 months). All patients had received at least two prior platinum-containing regimens and were in response (complete or partial) to their most recent platinum-based regimen. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST, version 1.1. An additional efficacy outcome measure was OS. A total of 295 patients were randomized, 196 to Lynparza and 99 to placebo. The median age of patients treated with Lynparza was 56 years (range: 28 to 83) and 56 years (range: 39 to 78) among patients treated with placebo. The ECOG PS was 0 in 83% of patients receiving Lynparza and 78% of patients receiving placebo. Of all patients, 89% were White, 17% were enrolled in the U.S. or Canada, 47% were in complete response to their most recent platinum-based regimen, and 40% had a progression-free interval of 6-12 months since their penultimate platinum regimen. Prior bevacizumab therapy was reported for 17% of those treated with Lynparza and 20% of those receiving placebo. Approximately 44% of patients on the Lynparza arm and 37% on placebo had received three or more lines of platinum-based treatment. All patients had a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation as detected either by a local test (n=236) or central Myriad CLIA test (n=59), subsequently confirmed by BRACAnalysis CDx ® (n=286). SOLO-2 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in investigator-assessed PFS in patients randomized to Lynparza as compared with placebo. Results from a blinded independent review were consistent. The final analysis of OS did not reach statistical significance. Efficacy results are presented in Table 20 and Figures 3 and 4.

Patients were randomized to Lynparza capsules 400 mg orally twice daily or placebo until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease. Randomization was stratified by response to last platinum chemotherapy (complete response versus partial response), time to disease progression in the penultimate platinum-based chemotherapy (6-12 months versus >12 months), and descent (Jewish versus non-Jewish). The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed PFS according to RECIST, version 1.0. A total of 265 patients were randomized, 136 to Lynparza and 129 to placebo. The median age of patients treated with Lynparza was 58 years (range: 21 to 89) and 59 years (range 33 to 84) among patients treated with placebo. ECOG PS was 0 in 81% of patients receiving Lynparza and 74% of patients receiving placebo. Of all patients, 97% were White, 19% were enrolled in the US or Canada, 45% were in complete response following their most recent platinum chemotherapy regimen, and 40% had a progression-free interval of 6-12 months since their penultimate platinum. Prior bevacizumab therapy was reported for 13% of patients receiving Lynparza and 16% of patients receiving placebo. A retrospective analysis for germline BRCA mutation status, some performed using the Myriad test, indicated that 36% (n=96) of patients from the ITT population had deleterious g BRCA mutation, including 39% (n=53) of patients on Lynparza and 33% (n=43) of patients on placebo. Efficacy results are presented in Table 21 and Figure 5. Study 19 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in investigator-assessed PFS in patients treated with Lynparza versus placebo.

A total of 137 patients with measurable, advanced g BRCA m ovarian cancer treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy were enrolled. All patients received Lynparza capsules 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST, version 1.0. The median age of the patients was 58 years, the majority were White (94%) and 93% had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Deleterious or suspected deleterious g BRCA m status was verified retrospectively in 97% (59/61) of the patients for whom blood samples were available by the BRACAnalysis CDx TM . Efficacy results are summarized in Table 22.

Patients were required to have received treatment with an anthracycline (unless contraindicated) and a taxane, in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. Patients with hormone receptor-positive disease must have progressed on at least 1 endocrine therapy (adjuvant or metastatic), or have disease that the treating healthcare provider believed to be inappropriate for endocrine therapy. Patients with prior platinum therapy were required to have no evidence of disease progress during platinum treatment. No prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor was permitted. Patients were randomized to Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily or healthcare provider’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine, at standard doses) until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by prior use of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes vs no), hormone receptor status (hormone receptor positive vs triple negative), and previous use of platinum-based chemotherapy (yes vs no). The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using RECIST version 1.1. A total of 302 patients were randomized, 205 to Lynparza and 97 to chemotherapy. Among the 205 patients treated with Lynparza, the median age was 44 years (range: 22 to 76), 65% were White, 4% were males and all the patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Approximately 50% of patients had triple-negative tumors and 50% had estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive tumors and the proportions were balanced across treatment arms. Patients in each treatment arm had received a median of 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease; approximately 30% had not received a prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer. Twenty-one percent of patients in the Lynparza arm and 14% in the chemotherapy arm had received platinum therapy for metastatic disease. Seven percent of patients in each treatment arm had received platinum therapy for localized disease. Of the 302 patients randomized onto OlympiAD, 299 were tested with the BRACAnalysis CDx ® and 297 were confirmed to have deleterious or suspected deleterious g BRCA m status; 202 were randomized to the Lynparza arm and 95 to the healthcare provider’s choice of chemotherapy arm. A statistically significant improvement in PFS was demonstrated for the Lynparza arm compared to the chemotherapy arm. Efficacy data for OlympiAD are displayed in Table 23 and Figure 6. Consistent results were observed across patient subgroups defined by study stratification factors. An exploratory analysis of investigator-assessed PFS was consistent with the BICR-assessed PFS results.

Patients were required to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation (g BRCA m) and absence of disease progression after receipt of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for at least 16 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive Lynparza tablets 300 mg orally twice daily or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS by BICR using RECIST, version 1.1 modified to assess patients with clinical complete response at entry who were assessed as having no evidence of disease unless they had progressed based on the appearance of new lesions. Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR. A total of 154 patients were randomized, 92 to Lynparza and 62 to placebo. The median age was 57 years (range 36 to 84); 54% were male; 92% were White, 4% were Asian, and 3% were Black; baseline ECOG PS was 0 (67%) or 1 (31%). The median time from initiation of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy to randomization was 5.8 months (range 3.4 to 33.4 months). Seventy-five percent (75%) of patients received FOLFIRINOX with a median of 9 cycles (range 4-61), 8% received FOLFOX or XELOX, 4% received GEMOX, and 3% received gemcitabine plus cisplatin; 49% achieved a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. All patients had a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA -mutation as detected by the Myriad BRAC Analysis ® or BRACAnalysis CDx ® at a central laboratory only (n=106), local BRCA test only (n=4), or both local and central testing (n=44). Among the 150 patients with central test results, 30% had a mutation in BRCA1 ; 69% had a mutation in BRCA2 ; and 1 patient (1%) had mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 . Efficacy results of POLO are provided in Table 24 and Figure 7.

Figure 7 Kaplan-Meier Curves of BICR-Assessed Progression-Free Survival – POLO Figure 6 14.7 HRR Gene-mutated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer The efficacy of Lynparza was evaluated in PROfound (NCT02987543), randomized, open-label, multi-center trial that evaluated the efficacy of Lynparza 300 mg twice daily versus a comparator arm of investigator’s choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). All patients received a GnRH analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. Patients needed to have progressed on prior enzalutamide or abiraterone for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and/or CRPC and have a tumor mutation in one of 15 genes involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on HRR gene mutation status. Patients with mutations in either BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or ATM were randomized in Cohort A; patients with mutations among 12 other genes involved in the HRR pathway ( BARD1 , BRIP1 , CDK12 , CHEK1 , CHEK2 , FANCL , PALB2 , PPP2R2A , RAD51B , RAD51C , RAD51D , or RAD54L ) were randomized in Cohort B; patients with co-mutations ( BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or ATM plus a Cohort B gene) were assigned to Cohort A. Although patients with PPP2R2A gene mutations were enrolled in the trial, Lynparza is not indicated for the treatment of patients with this gene mutation due to unfavorable risk-benefit. Patients were randomized (2:1), 256 to Lynparza arm and 131 to enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate arm; in Cohort A there were 245 (162 Lynparza arm and 83 in enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate arm) and in Cohort B there were 142 patients (94 in Lynparza arm and 48 in enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate arm). Randomization was stratified by prior receipt of taxane chemotherapy and presence of measurable disease by RECIST 1.1. Treatment was continued until objective radiological disease progression determined by BICR. Upon radiological progression confirmed by BICR, patients randomized to enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate were given the option to switch to olaparib. Patients with HRR gene mutations were identified by tissue-based testing using the Foundation Medicine FoundationOne ® clinical trial HRR assay performed at a central laboratory. Determination of deleterious or suspected deleterious somatic or germline HRR mutation status in line with the FDA approved mutation classification and testing criteria for the Foundation Medicine F1CDx tissue-based assay and assessment of the germline- BRCA status using the Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx blood-based assay was performed retrospectively. Representation of individual gene mutations by cohort is provided in Table 25. No patients were enrolled who had mutations in two of the 15 pre-specified HRR genes: FANCL and RAD51C . Table 25 Frequency of Patients with HRR Mutations Enrolled in PROfound HRR Mutation Cohort A N=245 n (%) Cohort B Three patients with single BRCA2 or ATM gene mutations and 1 patient with co-occurring BRCA2+CDK12 gene mutations were incorrectly assigned to Cohort B.

The ECOG performance score was 0 or 1 in most patients (95%) in both arms. In patients treated with Lynparza, the proportion of patients with RECIST 1.1 measurable disease at baseline was 58%, including 17% with lung and 10% with liver metastases, respectively. At randomization, 66% of patients had received prior taxane chemotherapy, 40% had received enzalutamide, 38% had received abiraterone acetate, and 20% had received both enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate. Patient characteristics were well-balanced between arms. The major efficacy outcome of the study was radiological progression free survival (rPFS) (Cohort A) as determined by BICR using RECIST version 1.1 and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) (bone) criteria. Additional efficacy outcomes included confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (Cohort A), rPFS (combined Cohorts A+B) as assessed by BICR, and overall survival (OS) (Cohort A). PROfound demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in BICR-assessed rPFS for Lynparza compared to investigator’s choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in Cohort A and Cohort A+B. In an exploratory analysis for patients in Cohort B, the median rPFS was 4.8 months for Lynparza vs 3.3 months for comparator with a HR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.58, 1.36). The major efficacy outcome was supported by a statistically significant improvement in ORR by BICR for patients with measurable disease at baseline in Cohort A. In Cohort B, ORR by BICR was 3.7% (95% CI 0.5, 12.7) in Lynparza treated patients and 8.3% (95% CI 1.0, 27.0) in patients treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate. The final analysis of overall survival (OS) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients randomized to Lynparza compared to patients in the enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate arm in Cohort A. Efficacy results of PROfound are provided in Tables 26 and 27 and Figures 8 and 9.

        "Medication Guide Lynparza ® (Lin-par-zah) (olaparib) tablets What is the most important information I should know about Lynparza? Lynparza may cause serious side effects, including: Bone marrow problems called Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Some people who have ovarian cancer or breast cancer and who have received previous treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or certain other medicines for their cancer have developed MDS or AML during treatment with Lynparza. MDS or AML may lead to death. If you develop MDS or AML, your healthcare provider will stop treatment with Lynparza. Symptoms of low blood cell counts are common during treatment with Lynparza, but can be a sign of serious bone marrow problems, including MDS or AML. Symptoms may include: • weakness • weight loss • fever • frequent infections • blood in urine or stool • shortness of breath • feeling very tired • bruising or bleeding more easily Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your blood cell counts: • before treatment with Lynparza • every month during treatment with Lynparza • weekly if you have low blood cell counts that last a long time. Your healthcare provider may stop treatment with Lynparza until your blood cell counts improve. Lung problems (pneumonitis). Tell your healthcare provider if you have any new or worsening symptoms of lung problems, including shortness of breath, fever, cough, or wheezing. Your healthcare provider may do a chest x-ray if you have any of these symptoms. Your healthcare provider may temporarily or completely stop treatment if you develop pneumonitis. Pneumonitis may lead to death. Blood clots (Venous Thromboembolic Events). Some people with prostate cancer who take Lynparza along with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog therapy may develop a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg (venous thrombosis) or a clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism). Tell your healthcare provider if you have any symptoms such as pain or swelling in an extremity, shortness of breath, chest pain, breathing that is more rapid than normal (tachypnea), or heart beats faster than normal (tachycardia). Your healthcare provider will monitor you for these symptoms and may prescribe blood thinner medicine. What is Lynparza? Lynparza is a prescription medicine used to treat adults who have: • advanced ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer with a certain type of inherited (germline) or acquired (somatic) abnormal BRCA gene. Lynparza is used alone as maintenance treatment after the cancer has responded to your first treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure that Lynparza is right for you. • advanced ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer with a certain type of abnormal BRCA gene or a positive laboratory tumor test for genomic instability called HRD. Lynparza is used in combination with another anti-cancer medicine, bevacizumab, as maintenance treatment after the cancer has responded to your first treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure that Lynparza is right for you. • ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer, as maintenance treatment, when the cancer has come back. Lynparza is used after the cancer has responded to treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. • advanced ovarian cancer with a certain type of abnormal inherited BRCA gene, and have received treatment with 3 or more prior types of chemotherapy medicines. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure that Lynparza is right for you. • a certain type of abnormal inherited BRCA gene, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). You should have received chemotherapy medicines, either before or after your cancer has spread. If you have hormone receptor (HR)-positive disease, you should have been treated with hormonal therapy. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure that Lynparza is right for you. • metastatic pancreatic cancer with a certain type of abnormal inherited BRCA gene. Lynparza is used as maintenance treatment after your cancer has not progressed on at least 16 weeks of treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure that Lynparza is right for you. • prostate cancer with certain inherited or acquired abnormal genes called homologous recombination repair (HRR genes). Lynparza is used when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic), and no longer responds to a medical or surgical treatment that lowers testosterone, and has progressed after treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure Lynparza is right for you. It is not known if Lynparza is safe and effective in children. Before taking Lynparza, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: • have lung or breathing problems • have kidney problems • are pregnant, become pregnant, or plan to become pregnant. Lynparza can harm your unborn baby and may cause loss of pregnancy (miscarriage). ∘ If you are able to become pregnant, your healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with Lynparza. ∘ Females who are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with Lynparza and for 6 months after the last dose of Lynparza. Talk to your healthcare provider about birth control methods that may be right for you. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you might be pregnant following treatment with Lynparza. ∘ Males with female partners who are pregnant or able to become pregnant should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with Lynparza and for 3 months after the last dose of Lynparza. ∘ Do not donate sperm during treatment with Lynparza and for 3 months after your final dose. • are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Lynparza passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment with Lynparza and for 1 month after receiving the last dose of Lynparza. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby during this time. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take , including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Taking Lynparza and certain other medicines may affect how Lynparza works and may cause side effects. How should I take Lynparza? • Take Lynparza tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. • Do not change your dose or stop taking Lynparza unless your healthcare provider tells you to. Your healthcare provider may temporarily stop treatment with Lynparza or change your dose of Lynparza if you experience side effects. • Your healthcare provider will decide how long you stay on treatment. • Do not take more than 4 Lynparza tablets in 1 day. If you have any questions about Lynparza, please talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist. • Take Lynparza by mouth 2 times a day. • Each dose should be taken about 12 hours apart. • Swallow Lynparza tablets whole. Do not chew, crush, dissolve, or divide the tablets. • Take Lynparza with or without food. • If you are taking Lynparza for prostate cancer and you are receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog therapy, you should continue with this treatment during your treatment with Lynparza unless you have had a surgery to lower the amount of testosterone in your body (surgical castration). • If you miss a dose of Lynparza, take your next dose at your usual scheduled time. Do not take an extra dose to make up for a missed dose. • If you take too much Lynparza, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. What should I avoid while taking Lynparza? Avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges and Seville orange juice during treatment with Lynparza since they may increase the level of Lynparza in your blood.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Olaparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, including PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3. PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular functions, such as DNA transcription and DNA repair. Olaparib has been shown to inhibit growth of select tumor cell lines in vitro and decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer, both as monotherapy or following platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity following treatment with olaparib were noted in cell lines and mouse tumor models with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 , ATM , or other genes involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA damage and correlated with platinum response. In vitro studies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes, resulting in DNA damage and cancer cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of olaparib on cardiac repolarization was assessed in 119 patients following a single dose of 300 mg and in 109 patients following multiple dosing of 300 mg twice daily. No clinically relevant effect of olaparib on QT interval was observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The area under the curve (AUC) of olaparib increases approximately proportionally following administration of single doses of 25 mg to 450 mg (0.08 to 1.5 times the recommended dose) and maximal concentrations (C max ) increased slightly less than proportionally for the same dose range. Olaparib showed time-dependent pharmacokinetics and an AUC mean accumulation ratio of 1.8 is observed at steady state following a dose of 300 mg twice daily. The mean (CV%) olaparib C max is 5.4 μg/mL (32%) and AUC is 39.2 μg*h/mL (44%) following a single 300 mg dose. The mean steady state olaparib C max and AUC is 7.6 μg/mL (35%) and 49.2 μg*h/mL (44%), following a dose of 300 mg twice daily. Absorption Following oral administration of olaparib, the median time to peak plasma concentration is 1.5 hours. Effect of Food Co-administration of a high fat and high calorie meal (800-1000 kcal, 50% of the calorie content made up from fat) with olaparib slowed the rate (t max delayed by 2.5 hours) of absorption, but did not significantly alter the extent of olaparib absorption (mean AUC increased by approximately 8%). Distribution The mean (± standard deviation) apparent volume of distribution of olaparib is 158 ± 136 L following a single 300 mg dose of Lynparza. The protein binding of olaparib is approximately 82% in vitro. Elimination The mean (± standard deviation) terminal plasma half-life of olaparib is 14.9 ± 8.2 hours and the apparent plasma clearance is 7.4 ± 3.9 L/h following a single 300 mg dose of Lynparza. Metabolism Olaparib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A in vitro. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled olaparib to female patients, unchanged olaparib accounted for 70% of the circulating radioactivity in plasma. It was extensively metabolized with unchanged drug accounting for 15% and 6% of radioactivity in urine and feces, respectively. The majority of the metabolism is attributable to oxidation reactions with a number of the components produced undergoing subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. Excretion Following a single dose of radiolabeled olaparib, 86% of the dosed radioactivity was recovered within a 7-day collection period, 44% via the urine and 42% via the feces. The majority of the material was excreted as metabolites. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment In a renal impairment trial, the mean AUC increased by 24% and C max by 15%, when olaparib was dosed in patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr=51-80 mL/min defined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation; n=13) and by 44% and 26%, respectively, when olaparib was dosed in patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr=31-50 mL/min; n=13), compared to those with normal renal function (CLcr ≥81 mL/min; n=12). There was no evidence of a relationship between the extent of plasma protein binding of olaparib and creatinine clearance. There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (CLcr ≤30 mL/min). Patients with Hepatic Impairment In a hepatic impairment trial, the mean AUC increased by 15% and the mean C max increased by 13% when olaparib was dosed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification A; n=10) and the mean AUC increased by 8% and the mean C max decreased by 13% when olaparib was dosed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification B; n=8), compared to patients with normal hepatic function (n=13). Hepatic impairment has no effect on the protein binding of olaparib and, therefore, total plasma exposure was representative of free drug. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C). Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies CYP3A Inhibitors: Concomitant use of itraconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) increased olaparib C max by 42% and AUC by 170%. Concomitant use of fluconazole (moderate CYP3A inhibitor) is predicted to increase olaparib C max by 14% and AUC by 121%. CYP3A Inducers : Concomitant use of rifampicin (strong CYP3A inducer) decreased olaparib C max by 71% and AUC by 87%. Concomitant use of efavirenz (moderate CYP3A inducer) is predicted to decrease olaparib C max by 31% and AUC by 60%. In vitro Studies CYP Enzymes : Olaparib is both an inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A and an inducer of CYP2B6. Olaparib is predicted to be a weak CYP3A inhibitor in humans. UGT Enzymes : Olaparib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. Transporters : Olaparib is an inhibitor of BCRP, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, MATE1, and MATE2K. Olaparib is a substrate and inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-gp. The potential for olaparib to induce P-gp has not been evaluated."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with olaparib. Olaparib was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary pharmacology of olaparib and indicates potential for genotoxicity in humans. Olaparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test. In a fertility study, female rats received oral olaparib at doses of 0.05, 0.5, and 15 mg/kg/day for at least 14 days before mating through the first week of pregnancy. There were no adverse effects on mating and fertility rates at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (maternal systemic exposures approximately 7% of the human exposure (AUC 0-24h ) at the recommended dose). In a male fertility study, olaparib had no effect on mating and fertility in rats at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg/day following at least 70 days of olaparib treatment (with systemic exposures of approximately 5% of the human exposure (AUC 0-24h ) at the recommended dose)."
