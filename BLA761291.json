Once removed from refrigerated storage, equilibrate TECVAYLI to ambient temperature [15°C to 30°C (59°Fto 86°F)] for at least 15 minutes. Do not warm TECVAYLI in any other way. Once equilibrated, gently swirl the vial for approximately 10 seconds to mix. Do not shake. Withdraw the required injection volume of TECVAYLI from the vial(s) into an appropriately sized syringe using a transfer needle. Each injection volume should not exceed 2 mL. Divide doses requiring greater than 2 mL equally into multiple syringes. TECVAYLI is compatible with stainless steel injection needles and polypropylene or polycarbonate syringe material. Replace the transfer needle with an appropriately sized needle for injection. Administration of TECVAYLI Inject the required volume of TECVAYLI into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen (preferred injection site). Alternatively, TECVAYLI may be injected into the subcutaneous tissue at other sites (e.g., thigh). If multiple injections are required, TECVAYLI injections should be at least 2 cm apart. Do not inject into tattoos or scars or areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard or not intact. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed in accordance with local requirements. Storage If the prepared dosing syringe(s) of TECVAYLI is not used immediately, store syringe(s) at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) or at ambient temperature 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) for a maximum of 20 hours. Discard syringe(s) after 20 hours, if not used. Monitoring Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, patients should be hospitalized for 48 hours after administration of all doses within the TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ] ."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity : Can cause hepatotoxicity, including fatalities. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. ( 5.4 ) Infections : Can cause severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately. Withhold in patients with active infection during the step-up dosing schedule. ( 2.4 , 5.5 ) Neutropenia : Monitor complete blood cell counts at baseline and periodically during treatment. ( 5.6) Hypersensitivity and Other Administration Reactions : Systemic administration-related reactions and local injection site reactions can occur. Withhold or consider permanent discontinuation based on severity. ( 2.4 , 5.7 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : May cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.8 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Cytokine Release Syndrome TECVAYLI can cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including life-threatening or fatal reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In the clinical trial, CRS occurred in 72% of patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose, with Grade 1 CRS occurring in 50% of patients, Grade 2 in 21%, and Grade 3 in 0.6%. Recurrent CRS occurred in 33% of patients. Most patients experienced CRS following step-up dose 1 (42%), step-up dose 2 (35%), or the initial treatment dose (24%). Less than 3% of patients developed first occurrence of CRS following subsequent doses of TECVAYLI. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 (range: 1 to 6) days after the most recent dose with a median duration of 2 (range: 1 to 9) days. Clinical signs and symptoms of CRS included, but were not limited to, fever, hypoxia, chills, hypotension, sinus tachycardia, headache, and elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase elevation). Initiate therapy according to TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule to reduce risk of CRS [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.4) ] . Administer pretreatment medications to reduce risk of CRS and monitor patients following administration of TECVAYLI accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.4) ] . At the first sign of CRS, immediately evaluate patient for hospitalization. Administer supportive care based on severity and consider further management per current practice guidelines. Withhold or permanently discontinue TECVAYLI based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . TECVAYLI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.2 Neurologic Toxicity including ICANS TECVAYLI can cause serious or life-threatening neurologic toxicity, including Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In the clinical trial, neurologic toxicity occurred in 57% of patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose, with Grade 3 or 4 neurologic toxicity occurring in 2.4% of patients. The most frequent neurologic toxicities were headache (25%), motor dysfunction (16%), sensory neuropathy (15%), and encephalopathy (13%). With longer follow-up, Grade 4 seizure and fatal Guillain-Barré syndrome (one patient each) occurred in patients who received TECVAYLI. In the clinical trial, ICANS was reported in 6% of patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Recurrent ICANS occurred in 1.8% of patients. Most patients experienced ICANS following step-up dose 1 (1.2%), step-up dose 2 (0.6%), or the initial treatment dose (1.8%). Less than 3% of patients developed first occurrence of ICANS following subsequent doses of TECVAYLI. The median time to onset of ICANS was 4 (range: 2 to 8) days after the most recent dose with a median duration of 3 (range: 1 to 20) days. The most frequent clinical manifestations of ICANS reported were confusional state and dysgraphia. The onset of ICANS can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS, or in the absence of CRS. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicity during treatment. At the first sign of neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, immediately evaluate patient and provide supportive therapy based on severity. Withhold or permanently discontinue TECVAYLI based on severity per recommendations and consider further management per current practice guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Due to the potential for neurologic toxicity, patients receiving TECVAYLI are at risk of depressed level of consciousness [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Advise patients to refrain from driving or operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery during and for 48 hours after completion of TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule and in the event of new onset of any neurologic toxicity symptoms until neurologic toxicity resolves [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . TECVAYLI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.3 TECVAYLI and TALVEY REMS TECVAYLI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the TECVAYLI and TALVEY REMS because of the risks of CRS and neurologic toxicity, including ICANS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ]. Notable requirements of the TECVAYLI and TALVEY REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving TECVAYLI about the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, and provide patients with Patient Wallet Card. Pharmacies and healthcare settings that dispense TECVAYLI must be certified with the TECVAYLI and TALVEY REMS program and must verify prescribers are certified through the TECVAYLI and TALVEY REMS program. Wholesalers and distributers must only distribute TECVAYLI to certified pharmacies or healthcare settings. Further information about the TECVAYLI and TALVEY REMS program is available at www.TEC-TALREMS.com or by telephone at 1-855-810-8064. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity TECVAYLI can cause hepatotoxicity, including fatalities. In patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, there was one fatal case of hepatic failure. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 34% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 elevations in 1.2%. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurred in 28% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 elevations in 1.8%. Elevated total bilirubin occurred in 6% of patients with Grade 3 or 4 elevations in 0.6%. Liver enzyme elevation can occur with or without concurrent CRS. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Withhold TECVAYLI or consider permanent discontinuation of TECVAYLI based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.5 Infections TECVAYLI can cause severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections. In patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, serious infections, including opportunistic infections, occurred in 30% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 infections in 35%, and fatal infections in 4.2% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment with TECVAYLI and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Withhold TECVAYLI or consider permanent discontinuation of TECVAYLI based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Monitor immunoglobulin levels during treatment with TECVAYLI and treat according to guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.6 Neutropenia TECVAYLI can cause neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. In patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, decreased neutrophils occurred in 84% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophils in 56%. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor complete blood cell counts at baseline and periodically during treatment and provide supportive care per local institutional guidelines. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Withhold TECVAYLI based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.7 Hypersensitivity and Other Administration Reactions TECVAYLI can cause both systemic administration-related reactions and local injection-site reactions. Systemic Reactions In patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, 1.2% of patients experienced systemic-administration reactions, which included Grade 1 recurrent pyrexia and Grade 1 swollen tongue. Local Reactions In patients who received TECVAYLI at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, injection-site reactions occurred in 35% of patients with Grade 1 injection-site reactions in 30% and Grade 2 in 4.8%. Withhold TECVAYLI or consider permanent discontinuation of TECVAYLI based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, TECVAYLI may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TECVAYLI and for 5 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma MajesTEC-1 The safety of TECVAYLI was evaluated in MajesTEC-1 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] which included adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Patients received step-up doses of 0.06 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg of TECVAYLI followed by TECVAYLI 1.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously once weekly (N=165). Among patients who received TECVAYLI, 47% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 7% were exposed for one year or longer. The median age of patients who received TECVAYLI was 64 years (range: 33 to 84 years); 58% were male; 81% were White, 13% were Black or African American, and 2% were Asian. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 54% of patients who received TECVAYLI. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included pneumonia (15%), cytokine release syndrome (8%), sepsis (6%), general physical health deterioration (6%), COVID-19 (6%), acute kidney injury (4.8%), pyrexia (4.8%), musculoskeletal pain (2.4%), and encephalopathy (2.4%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients who received TECVAYLI, including COVID-19 (1.8%), pneumonia (1.8%), septic shock (0.6%), acute renal failure (0.6%), and hemoperitoneum (0.6%). Permanent discontinuation of TECVAYLI due to adverse reactions occurred in 1.2% of patients. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of TECVAYLI included pneumonia (adenoviral and pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in the same patient) and hypercalcemia. Dosage interruptions of TECVAYLI due to an adverse reaction occurred in 73% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in >5% of patients included neutropenia, pneumonia, pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, upper respiratory tract infection, and COVID-19. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were pyrexia, CRS, musculoskeletal pain, injection site reaction, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, headache, pneumonia, and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥20%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, decreased white blood cells, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased platelets.

        "11 DESCRIPTION Teclistamab-cqyv, a bispecific B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed CD3 T-cell engager, is a humanized immunoglobulin G4-proline, alanine, alanine (IgG4-PAA) antibody. Teclistamab-cqyv is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant DNA technology. Teclistamab-cqyv consists of an anti-BCMA heavy chain and light chain and an anti-CD3 heavy chain and light chain with two interchain disulfide bonds connecting the two arms. The molecular weight of teclistamab-cqyv is approximately 146 kDa. TECVAYLI ® (teclistamab-cqyv) injection is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to light yellow solution supplied in a single-dose vial for subcutaneous administration. Each TECVAYLI 3 mL single-dose vial contains 30 mg of teclistamab-cqyv, edetate disodium (0.054 mg), glacial acetic acid (0.72 mg), polysorbate 20 (1.2 mg), sodium acetate (2.7 mg), sucrose (240 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. Each TECVAYLI 1.7 mL single-dose vial contains 153 mg of teclistamab-cqyv, edetate disodium (0.031 mg), glacial acetic acid (0.41 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.68 mg), sodium acetate (1.5 mg), sucrose (140 mg), and Water for Injection, USP."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Teclistamab-cqyv is a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody that binds to the CD3 receptor expressed on the surface of T-cells and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells and some healthy B-lineage cells. In vitro , teclistamab-cqyv activated T-cells, caused the release of various proinflammatory cytokines, and resulted in the lysis of multiple myeloma cells. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Serum concentrations of cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) and IL-2R were measured before and after administration of step-up dose 1, step-up dose 2, and the first three treatment doses of TECVAYLI. Increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-2R were observed during this period. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The C max and AUC tau of teclistamab-cqyv after the first subcutaneous treatment dose increase proportionally over a dosage range of 0.08 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg (0.05 to 2 times the approved recommended treatment dosage). Ninety percent of steady state exposure was achieved after 12 weekly treatment doses. The mean accumulation ratio between the first and 13 th weekly treatment dose of teclistamab-cqyv 1.5 mg/kg was 4.2-fold for C max , 4.1-fold for C trough , and 5.3-fold for AUC tau . The C max , C trough , and AUC tau of teclistamab-cqyv are presented in Table 12. Table 12: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Teclistamab-cqyv for the 13 th Treatment Dose of 1.5 mg/kg Following administration of teclistamab-cqyv in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MajesTEC-1). Pharmacokinetic Parameter Teclistamab-cqyv Geometric Mean (CV%) SD = standard deviation; C max = Maximum serum teclistamab-cqyv concentration; C trough = Serum teclistamab-cqyv concentration prior to next dose; CV = geometric coefficient of variation; AUC tau = Area under the concentration-time curve over the weekly dosing interval. C max (mcg/mL) 23.8 (55%) C trough (mcg/mL) 21.1 (63%) AUC tau (mcg∙h/mL) 3,838 (57%) Absorption The mean bioavailability of teclistamab-cqyv was 72% when administered subcutaneously. The median (range) T max of teclistamab-cqyv after the first and 13 th treatment doses were 139 (19 to 168) hours and 72 (24 to 168) hours, respectively. Distribution The mean (coefficient of variation [CV]%) volume of distribution of teclistamab-cqyv was 5.63 L (29%). Elimination Teclistamab-cqyv clearance decreases over time, with a mean (CV%) maximal reduction from baseline to the 13 th treatment dose of 40.8% (56%). The geometric mean (CV%) clearance is 0.472 L/day (64%) at the 13 th treatment dose. Patients who discontinue teclistamab-cqyv after the 13 th treatment dose are expected to have a 50% reduction from C max in teclistamab-cqyv concentration at a median (5 th to 95 th percentile) time of 15 (7 to 33) days after T max and a 97% reduction from C max in teclistamab-cqyv concentration at a median time of 69 (32 to 163) days after T max . Specific Populations The volume of distribution and clearance of teclistamab-cqyv increase with increasing body weight (41 kg to 139 kg). There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of teclistamab-cqyv based on age (24 to 84 years), sex, race (White, Black or African American), ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, not Hispanic/Latino), mild or moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] method: 30 to 89 mL/min), or mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin less than or equal to upper limit of normal [ULN] with AST greater than ULN or total bilirubin greater than 1 to 1.5 times ULN with any AST). The effects of severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min) or moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin greater than 1.5 times ULN with any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of teclistamab-cqyv are unknown. Drug Interaction Studies No clinical studies evaluating the drug interaction potential of teclistamab-cqyv have been conducted. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of teclistamab-cqyv or of other teclistamab products. During treatment in MajesTEC-1 (up to 27 months), 1/186 (0.5%) of patients treated with subcutaneous TECVAYLI at various dosages developed anti-teclistamab-cqyv antibodies. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of teclistamab products is unknown."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of TECVAYLI was evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in a single-arm, open-label, multi-center study (MajesTEC-1, NCT03145181 [Phase 1] and NCT04557098 [Phase 2]). The study included patients who had previously received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. The study excluded patients who had stroke, seizure, allogeneic stem cell transplantation within the past 6 months, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 2 or higher, known active CNS involvement or clinical signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma, or active or documented history of autoimmune disease, with the exception of vitiligo, Type 1 diabetes, and prior autoimmune thyroiditis. Patients received step-up doses of 0.06 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg of TECVAYLI followed by TECVAYLI 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously once weekly thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . The efficacy population included 110 patients. The median age was 66 (range: 33 to 82) years with 16% of patients 75 years of age or older; 56% were male; 91% were White, 5% were Black or African American, 3% were Asian. The International Staging System (ISS) at study entry was Stage I in 50%, Stage II in 38%, and Stage III in 12% of patients. High-risk cytogenetics (presence of del(17p), t(4;14) and t(14;16)) were present in 25% of patients. Seventeen percent of patients had extramedullary plasmacytomas. Patients with prior BCMA-targeted therapy were not included in the efficacy population. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 5 (range: 2 to 14); 78% of patients had received at least 4 prior lines of therapy. Eighty-one percent of patients received prior stem cell transplantation. All patients had received prior therapy with a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and 76% were triple-class refractory (refractory to a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody). Efficacy was established based on overall response rate (ORR) as determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) 2016 criteria (see Table 13 ). The median time to first response was 1.2 months (range: 0.2 to 5.5 months). With a median follow-up of 7.4 months among responders, the estimated duration of response (DOR) rate was 90.6% (95% CI: 80.3%, 95.7%) at 6 months and 66.5% (95% CI: 38.8%, 83.9%) at 9 months.

Revised: August 2023 What is the most important information I should know about TECVAYLI? TECVAYLI may cause side effects that are serious, life-threatening or lead to death, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Neurologic problems. Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any of the signs or symptoms of CRS or neurologic problems listed below at any time during your treatment with TECVAYLI: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). Signs and symptoms of CRS may include: fever (100.4°F or higher) difficulty breathing chills dizziness or lightheadedness fast heartbeat feeling anxious confusion or restlessness headache increased liver enzymes in your blood Neurologic problems. Symptoms of neurologic problems with TECVAYLI include: headache jerking movements rigid muscles feeling restless numbness and tingling (feeling like \"pins and needles\") confusion trouble speaking muscle spasms tremor double vision changes in your handwriting problems walking muscle weakness in your body or face hearing loss burning, throbbing, or stabbing pain Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic symptoms, you should be hospitalized for 48 hours after all doses of TECVAYLI that are part of the \"step-up dosing schedule.\" The \"step-up dosing schedule\" is when you receive the first 2 doses of TECVAYLI, which are called \"step-up\" doses, and then you receive the first \"treatment dose\" of TECVAYLI. After \"step-up\" dose 1 of TECVAYLI, the dose of TECVAYLI is increased. After \"step-up\" dose 2, the dose is increased again when you receive the first \"treatment dose\" of TECVAYLI. \"Step-up dose 1\" is given on day 1 of treatment. \"Step-up dose 2\" is usually given on day 4 of treatment. The first \"treatment dose\" is usually given on day 7 of treatment. Your healthcare provider will decide when you will receive \"step-up dose 2\" and your first \"treatment dose.\" \"Step-up\" dose 2 may be given between 2 to 4 days after \"step-up\" dose 1, or up to 7 days after \"step-up\" dose 1 if you have certain side effects with TECVAYLI. Your first \"treatment dose\" may be given between 2 to 4 days after \"step-up\" dose 2, or up to 7 days after \"step-up\" dose 2 if you have certain side effects with TECVAYLI. Your healthcare provider will decide the number of days to wait between your doses of TECVAYLI as well as how many treatments you will receive. If your dose of TECVAYLI is delayed for any reason, you may need to repeat the \"step-up dosing schedule\" to receive TECVAYLI. Before each \"step-up\" dose and your first \"treatment dose\" of TECVAYLI you will receive medicines to help reduce your risk of CRS. Your healthcare provider will decide if you need to receive medicines to help reduce your risk of CRS with future doses. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic problems during treatment with TECVAYLI, as well as other side effects and treat you as needed. Do not drive or operate heavy or dangerous machinery during and for 48 hours after your TECVAYLI \"step-up dosing schedule\" is completed, or at any time during treatment with TECVAYLI if you develop new neurologic symptoms until the symptoms go away. TECVAYLI is available only through the TECVAYLI and TALVEY Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) due to the risk of CRS and neurologic problems. You will receive a Patient Wallet Card from your healthcare provider. Carry the Patient Wallet Card with you at all times and show it to all of your healthcare providers. The Patient Wallet Card lists signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic problems. Get medical help right away if you develop any of the signs and symptoms listed on the Patient Wallet Card. You may need to be treated in a hospital. If you have any questions about TECVAYLI, ask your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may temporarily stop or completely stop your treatment with TECVAYLI if you develop CRS, neurologic problems or any other side effects that are severe.
