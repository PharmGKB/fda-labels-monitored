        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer ELAHERE as an intravenous infusion only after dilution in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. ELAHERE is incompatible with normal saline. ( 2.5 ) The recommended dose of ELAHERE is 6 mg/kg adjusted ideal body weight administered as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ( 2.2 ) Premedicate with a corticosteroid, antihistamine, and antipyretic. ( 2.3 ) Premedicate with an antiemetic, ophthalmic topical steroids, and lubricating eye drops. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) See full Prescribing Information for preparation and administration instructions and dose modifications for adverse reactions. ( 2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for the treatment of platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with ELAHERE based on the presence of FRα tumor expression [see Indications & Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] using an FDA-approved test. Information on FDA-approved tests for the measurement of FRα tumor expression is available at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of ELAHERE is 6 mg/kg adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) administered once every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) as an intravenous infusion until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The total dose of ELAHERE is calculated based on each patient's AIBW using the following formula: AIBW = Ideal Body Weight (IBW [kg]) + 0.4*(Actual weight [kg] – IBW) Female IBW (kg) = 0.9*height(cm) – 92 2.3 Premedication and Required Eye Care Premedication Administer the premedications in Table 1 prior to each infusion of ELAHERE to reduce the incidence and severity of infusion related reactions (IRRs), nausea, and vomiting. Table 1: Premedication Prior to Each ELAHERE Infusion Premedication Route of Administration Examples (or equivalent) Administration Time Prior to ELAHERE Infusion Corticosteroid intravenous dexamethasone 10 mg At least 30 minutes prior Antihistamine oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 25 mg to 50 mg Antipyretic oral or intravenous acetaminophen 325 mg to 650 mg Antiemetic oral or intravenous 5-HT 3 serotonin receptor antagonist or appropriate alternatives Before each dose and thereafter as needed Consider additional premedications including corticosteroids the day prior to ELAHERE administration for patients who experienced IRRs. Ophthalmic Exams and Premedication Ophthalmic exam : Conduct an ophthalmic exam including visual acuity and slit lamp exam prior to initiation of ELAHERE, every other cycle for the first 8 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Ophthalmic Topical Steroids: The use of ophthalmic topical steroids is recommended. The initial prescription and renewals of any corticosteroid medication should be made only after examination with a slit lamp. Administer one drop of ophthalmic topical steroids in each eye 6 times daily starting the day prior to each infusion until day 4; then administer one drop in each eye 4 times daily for days 5-8 of each cycle of ELAHERE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Lubricating Eye Drops : The use of lubricating eye drops at least four times daily and as needed is recommended during treatment with ELAHERE. Instruct patients to use lubricating eye drops and advise to wait at least 10 minutes after ophthalmic topical steroid administration before instilling lubricating eye drops [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.4 Dosage Modifications Table 2 provides dose reductions and modifications for adverse reactions.

Grade 4 Permanently discontinue. 2.5 Instructions for Preparation and Administration Preparation ELAHERE is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 . Calculate the dose (mg) (based on the patient's AIBW), total volume (mL) of solution required, and the number of vials of ELAHERE needed [see Recommended Dosage (2.2) and Dose Modifications (2.4) ] . More than one vial will be needed for a full dose. Remove the vials of ELAHERE from the refrigerator and allow to warm to room temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. ELAHERE is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless solution. Gently swirl and inspect each vial prior to withdrawing the calculated dose volume of ELAHERE for subsequent further dilution. Do not shake the vial. Using aseptic technique, withdraw the calculated dose volume of ELAHERE for subsequent further dilution. ELAHERE contains no preservatives and is intended for single-dose only. Discard any unused drug remaining in the vial. Dilution ELAHERE must be diluted prior to administration with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL. ELAHERE is incompatible with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. ELAHERE must not be mixed with any other drugs or intravenous fluids. Determine the volume of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP required to achieve the final diluted drug concentration. Either remove excess 5% Dextrose Injection, USP from a prefilled intravenous bag or add the calculated volume of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to a sterile empty intravenous bag. Then add the calculated dose volume of ELAHERE to the intravenous bag. Gently mix the diluted drug solution by slowly inverting the bag several times to assure uniform mixing. Do not shake or agitate. If the diluted infusion solution is not used immediately, store solution either at ambient temperature [(18°C to 25°C (64.4°F to 77°F)] for no more than 8 hours (including infusion time), or under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for no more than 12 hours. If refrigerated, allow the infusion bag to reach room temperature prior to administration. After refrigeration, administer diluted infusion solutions within 8 hours (including infusion time). Do not freeze prepared infusion solution. Administration Inspect the ELAHERE intravenous infusion bag visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Administer pre-medications prior to ELAHERE administration [see Premedication and Prophylactic Regimen (2.3) ] . Administer ELAHERE as an intravenous infusion only, using a 0.2 or 0.22 µm polyethersulfone (PES) in-line filter. Do not substitute other membrane materials. Administer the initial dose as an intravenous infusion at the rate of 1 mg/min. If well tolerated after 30 minutes at 1 mg/min, the infusion rate can be increased to 3 mg/min. If well tolerated after 30 minutes at 3 mg/min, the infusion rate can be increased to 5 mg/min. If no infusion-related reactions occur with the previous dose, subsequent infusions should be started at the maximally tolerated rate and may be increased up to a maximum infusion rate of 5 mg/min, as tolerated. Following the infusion, flush the intravenous line with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to ensure delivery of the full dose. Do not use any other intravenous fluids for flushing."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pneumonitis: Withhold ELAHERE for persistent or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue ELAHERE for Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Peripheral Neuropathy: Monitor patients for new or worsening peripheral neuropathy. Withhold dosage, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue ELAHERE based on the severity of peripheral neuropathy. ( 2.4 , 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: ELAHERE can cause fetal harm. Advise of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Ocular Disorders ELAHERE can cause severe ocular adverse reactions, including visual impairment, keratopathy (corneal disorders), dry eye, photophobia, eye pain, and uveitis. Ocular adverse reactions occurred in 61% of patients with ovarian cancer treated with ELAHERE. Nine percent (9%) of patients experienced Grade 3 ocular adverse reactions, including visual impairment, keratopathy/keratitis (corneal disorders), dry eye, photophobia, and eye pain; and one patient (0.2%) experienced Grade 4 keratopathy. The most common (≥5%) ocular adverse reactions were visual impairment (49%), keratopathy (36%), dry eye (26%), cataract (15%), photophobia (13%), and eye pain (12%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The median time to onset for first ocular adverse reaction was 1.2 months (range: 0.03 to 12.9). Of the patients who experienced ocular events, 49% had complete resolution and 39% had partial improvement (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more grades from the worst grade) at last follow up. Ocular adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of ELAHERE in 0.6% of patients. Premedication and use of lubricating and ophthalmic topical steroid eye drops during treatment with ELAHERE are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Advise patients to avoid use of contact lenses during treatment with ELAHERE unless directed by a healthcare provider. Refer patients to an eye care professional for an ophthalmic exam including visual acuity and slit lamp exam prior to treatment initiation, every other cycle for the first 8 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Promptly refer patients to an eye care professional for any new or worsening ocular signs and symptoms. Monitor for ocular toxicity and withhold, reduce, or permanently discontinue ELAHERE based on severity and persistence of ocular adverse reactions. [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.2 Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ELAHERE. Pneumonitis occurred in 10% of patients treated with ELAHERE, including 0.8% with Grade 3 events, and 1 patient (0.2%) with a Grade 4 event. One patient (0.2%) died due to respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonitis and lung metastases. Pneumonitis resulted in ELAHERE dose reduction in 1%, dose interruptions in 3%, and permanent discontinuation in 3% of patients. Monitor patients for pulmonary signs and symptoms of pneumonitis, which may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for such symptoms should be excluded through appropriate investigations. Withhold ELAHERE for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis until symptoms resolve to ≤ Grade 1 and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue ELAHERE in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Patients who are asymptomatic may continue dosing of ELAHERE with close monitoring. 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 36% of patients with ovarian cancer treated with ELAHERE across clinical trials; 2% of patients experienced Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy adverse reactions included peripheral neuropathy (19%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (9%), paraesthesia (6%), neurotoxicity (3%), hypoaesthesia (2%), peripheral motor neuropathy (1%), neuralgia (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.2%) and oral hypoesthesia (0.2%). The median time to onset of peripheral neuropathy was 1.3 months (range 0.03 to 29.1). Of the patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy, 28% had complete resolution and 13% had partial improvement (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more grades from the worst grade) at last follow up. Peripheral neuropathy led to discontinuation of ELAHERE in 0.4% of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neuropathy, such as paresthesia, tingling or a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, muscle weakness, or dysesthesia. For patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy, withhold dosage, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue ELAHERE based on the severity of peripheral neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, ELAHERE can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because it contains a genotoxic compound (DM4) and affects actively dividing cells. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ELAHERE and for 7 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Ocular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Peripheral Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . The most common (≥20 %) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were vision impairment, fatigue, increased aspartate aminotransferase, nausea, increased alanine aminotransferase, keratopathy, abdominal pain, decreased lymphocytes, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, decreased albumin, constipation, increased alkaline phosphatase, dry eye, decreased magnesium, decreased leukocytes, decreased neutrophils, and decreased hemoglobin. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ImmunoGen at 1-833-486-4646 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to ELAHERE in 464 patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer at 6 mg/kg AIBW administered intravenously once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in Study 0417; Study 0403 (NCT02631876), and Study 0401 (NCT01609556). The median duration of treatment was 4.3 months (range: 0.7 to 30.4). Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer Study 0417 The safety of ELAHERE was evaluated in Study 0417, a single-arm, open-label study in patients (n=106) with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Patients received ELAHERE 6 mg/kg AIBW once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment was 4.2 months (range: 0.7 to 13.3). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 31% of patients. The most common (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were intestinal obstruction (8%), ascites (4%), infection (3%), and pleural effusion (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients, including small intestinal obstruction (1%) and pneumonitis (1%). Permanent discontinuation of ELAHERE due to adverse reactions occurred in 11% of patients. The most common (≥2%) adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation were intestinal obstruction (2%) and thrombocytopenia (2%). One patient (0.9%) permanently discontinued ELAHERE due to visual impairment (unilateral decrease to BCVA ≤ 20/200 that resolved to baseline after discontinuation). Dosage delays of ELAHERE due to an adverse reaction occurred in 39% of patients treated with ELAHERE. Adverse reactions which required dosage delays in ≥3% of patients included visual impairment (15%), keratopathy (11%), neutropenia (6%), dry eye (5%), cataracts (3%), and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (3%). Dose reductions of ELAHERE due to an adverse reaction occurred in 20% of patients.

      "description": [
        "11 DESCRIPTION Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is a folate receptor alpha (FRα)-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of three components: 1) an anti-FRα monoclonal antibody of IgG1 subtype 2) the small molecule anti-tubulin agent DM4 (a maytansine derivative) and 3) a linker, sulfo-SPDB (1-(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl)oxy-1-oxo-4-(pyridin-2-yldisulfanyl)butane-2-sulfonic acid) that covalently attaches DM4 to the mirvetuximab antibody. Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa. An average of 3.4 molecules of DM4 are attached to each antibody molecule. Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx has the following structure: ELAHERE (mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx) injection is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless solution containing 100 mg/20 mL of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx in single-dose vials. Each mL of solution contains 5 mg of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx, and glacial acetic acid (0.22 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.1 mg), sodium acetate (0.53 mg), sucrose (90 mg), and Water for Injection. The pH is approximately 5.0. The ELAHERE vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. Chemical Structure"

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The antibody is a chimeric IgG1 directed against folate receptor alpha (FRα). The small molecule, DM4, is a microtubule inhibitor attached to the antibody via a cleavable linker. Upon binding to FRα, mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is internalized followed by intracellular release of DM4 via proteolytic cleavage. DM4 disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Relationships An exposure-response relationship between mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx and overall response rates was observed. Higher incidence of Grade ≥2 ocular adverse reactions and Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy occurred with increasing mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx exposure. Cardiac Electrophysiology At the approved recommended dose, ELAHERE did not cause large mean increases (>10 msec) in the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics were characterized after patients were administered mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx 0.161 mg/kg to 8.71 mg/kg adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) dosages, (0.0268 times to 1.45 times the approved recommended dosage of 6 mg/kg AIBW), unless otherwise noted. Table 6 summarizes the exposure parameters of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx, unconjugated DM4, and its metabolite S-methyl-DM4 following administration after the first cycle (3-weeks) of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx 6 mg/kg to patients. Peak mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx concentrations were observed near the end of intravenous infusion, while peak unconjugated DM4 concentrations were observed on the second day after administration of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx, and the peak S-methyl-DM4 concentrations were observed approximately 3 days after administration of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx. Steady state concentrations of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx, DM4, and S-methyl-DM4 were reached after 1 treatment cycle. Accumulation of the mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx, DM4, and S-methyl-DM4 was minimal following repeat administration of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx. Table 6: Exposure Parameters of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine-gynx, Unconjugated DM4, and S-methyl DM4 After First Treatment Cycle of 6 mg/kg of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine-gynx Mirvetuximab Soravtansine-gynx Mean (±SD) Unconjugated DM4 Mean (±SD) S-methyl-DM4 Mean (±SD) C max = maximum concentration, AUC tau = area under the concentration vs. time curve over the dosing interval (21 days). C max 137.3 (±62.3) µg/mL 4.11 (±2.29) ng/mL 6.98 (±6.79) ng/mL AUC tau 20.65 (±6.84) h*mg/mL 530 (±245) h*ng/mL 1848 (±1585) h*ng/mL Distribution The mean (±SD) steady state volume of distribution of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx was 2.63 (±2.98) L. Human plasma protein binding of DM4 and S-methyl DM4 was >99%, in vitro. Elimination Total plasma clearance (geometric mean [CV%]) of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx was 18.9 mL/hour (51.9%). The geometric mean terminal phase half-life of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx after the first dose was 4.8 days leading to a steady state at approximately 24 days. For the unconjugated DM4, the total plasma clearance (geometric mean [CV%]) was 13.8 L/hour (31.1%) and the geometric mean terminal phase half-life was 2.8 days. For S-methyl-DM4, the total plasma clearance (geometric mean [CV%]) was 4.3 L/hour (63.6%) and the geometric mean terminal phase half-life was 5.0 days. Metabolism The monoclonal antibody portion of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is expected to be metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways. Unconjugated DM4 and S-methyl-DM4 undergo metabolism by CYP3A4. In human plasma, DM4 and S-methyl DM4 were identified as the main circulating metabolites, accounting for approximately 0.4% and 1.4% of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx AUCs, respectively. Excretion S-methyl DM4 and DM4-sulfo-SPDB-lysine were detected in urine within 24 hours of infusion as the main metabolites. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx were observed based on age (34 to 89 years), body weight (36 to 136 kg), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST), or mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥30 and <90 mL/min). The pharmacokinetics of ELAHERE in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 ULN with any AST) or severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 30 mL/min) is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical studies and model informed approaches No clinical studies evaluating the drug-drug interaction potential of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx have been conducted. However, in 3 clinical trials, there were no differences in exposure between patients who received concomitant weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors and those who did not. In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Unconjugated DM4 is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Unconjugated DM4 and S-methyl DM4 are not direct inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A. DM4 and S-methyl DM4 are not inducers of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. Transporter Systems: Unconjugated DM4 and S-methyl DM4 are substrates of P-gp but are not inhibitors of P-gp. 12.6 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation against mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (including neutralizing antibody) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies to mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx in other studies. With a median duration of treatment of 4.3 months in Studies 0417, 0401, and 0403, a total of 55/423 (13%) ovarian cancer patients treated with mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx at 6 mg/kg AIBW had at least 1 post-baseline positive sample for anti-mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx antibodies. Of those patients, 28/423 patients (7%) had developed treatment-emergent ADA and 3/423 patients (0.7%) had treatment-enhanced ADA. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 24/423 (6%) of patients. Because of the low occurrence of anti-mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and/or safety of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is unknown."

Peak mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx concentrations were observed near the end of intravenous infusion, while peak unconjugated DM4 concentrations were observed on the second day after administration of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx, and the peak S-methyl-DM4 concentrations were observed approximately 3 days after administration of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx. Steady state concentrations of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx, DM4, and S-methyl-DM4 were reached after 1 treatment cycle. Accumulation of the mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx, DM4, and S-methyl-DM4 was minimal following repeat administration of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx. Table 6: Exposure Parameters of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine-gynx, Unconjugated DM4, and S-methyl DM4 After First Treatment Cycle of 6 mg/kg of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine-gynx Mirvetuximab Soravtansine-gynx Mean (±SD) Unconjugated DM4 Mean (±SD) S-methyl-DM4 Mean (±SD) C max = maximum concentration, AUC tau = area under the concentration vs. time curve over the dosing interval (21 days). C max 137.3 (±62.3) µg/mL 4.11 (±2.29) ng/mL 6.98 (±6.79) ng/mL AUC tau 20.65 (±6.84) h*mg/mL 530 (±245) h*ng/mL 1848 (±1585) h*ng/mL Distribution The mean (±SD) steady state volume of distribution of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx was 2.63 (±2.98) L. Human plasma protein binding of DM4 and S-methyl DM4 was >99%, in vitro. Elimination Total plasma clearance (geometric mean [CV%]) of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx was 18.9 mL/hour (51.9%). The geometric mean terminal phase half-life of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx after the first dose was 4.8 days leading to a steady state at approximately 24 days. For the unconjugated DM4, the total plasma clearance (geometric mean [CV%]) was 13.8 L/hour (31.1%) and the geometric mean terminal phase half-life was 2.8 days. For S-methyl-DM4, the total plasma clearance (geometric mean [CV%]) was 4.3 L/hour (63.6%) and the geometric mean terminal phase half-life was 5.0 days. Metabolism The monoclonal antibody portion of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is expected to be metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways. Unconjugated DM4 and S-methyl-DM4 undergo metabolism by CYP3A4. In human plasma, DM4 and S-methyl DM4 were identified as the main circulating metabolites, accounting for approximately 0.4% and 1.4% of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx AUCs, respectively. Excretion S-methyl DM4 and DM4-sulfo-SPDB-lysine were detected in urine within 24 hours of infusion as the main metabolites. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx were observed based on age (34 to 89 years), body weight (36 to 136 kg), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST), or mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥30 and <90 mL/min). The pharmacokinetics of ELAHERE in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 ULN with any AST) or severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 30 mL/min) is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical studies and model informed approaches No clinical studies evaluating the drug-drug interaction potential of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx have been conducted. However, in 3 clinical trials, there were no differences in exposure between patients who received concomitant weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors and those who did not. In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Unconjugated DM4 is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Unconjugated DM4 and S-methyl DM4 are not direct inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A. DM4 and S-methyl DM4 are not inducers of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. Transporter Systems: Unconjugated DM4 and S-methyl DM4 are substrates of P-gp but are not inhibitors of P-gp."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ELAHERE was evaluated in Study 0417 (NCT04296890), a single-arm trial of patients with FRα positive, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (n=106). Patients were permitted to receive up to three prior lines of systemic therapy. All patients were required to have received prior bevacizumab. The trial enrolled patients whose tumors were positive for FRα expression as determined by the VENTANA FOLR1 (FOLR1-2.1) RxDx Assay. Patients were excluded if they had corneal disorders, ocular conditions requiring ongoing treatment, Grade >1 peripheral neuropathy, or noninfectious interstitial lung disease. Patients received ELAHERE 6 mg/kg (based on adjusted ideal body weight) as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor response assessments occurred every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. The efficacy evaluable population included 104 patients with platinum-resistant disease, who had measurable disease, and received at least one dose of ELAHERE. In these 104 patients, the median age was 62 years (range: 35 to 85); 96% were White, 2% were Asian, and 2% did not have race reported. Two percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino. All patients had an ECOG PS of 0 (57%) or 1 (43%). Ten percent of patients had received 1 prior line of systemic therapy, 39% of patients had received 2 prior lines of systemic therapy, and 50% of patients had received 3 prior lines of systemic therapy. All patients had received prior bevacizumab and 47% had received a prior PARP inhibitor. Efficacy results for Study 0417 are summarized in Table 7.
