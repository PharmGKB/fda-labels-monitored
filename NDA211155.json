        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 25 mg orally, twice daily. Modify dosage for toxicity. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing The recommended dose of COPIKTRA is 25 mg administered as oral capsules twice daily (BID) with or without food. A cycle consists of 28 days. The capsules should be swallowed whole. Advise patients not to open, break, or chew the capsules. Advise patients that if a dose is missed by fewer than 6 hours, to take the missed dose right away and take the next dose as usual. If a dose is missed by more than 6 hours, advise patients to wait and take the next dose at the usual time. 2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis Provide prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) during treatment with COPIKTRA. Following completion of COPIKTRA treatment, continue PJP prophylaxis until the absolute CD4+ T cell count is greater than 200 cells/µL. Withhold COPIKTRA in patients with suspected PJP of any grade, and discontinue if PJP is confirmed. Consider prophylactic antivirals during COPIKTRA treatment to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection including CMV reactivation. 2.3 Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions Manage toxicities per Table 1 with dose reduction, treatment hold, or discontinuation of COPIKTRA.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: Monitor hepatic function. ( 5.5 ) Neutropenia: Monitor blood counts. ( 5.6 ) Embryo-Fetal toxicity: COPIKTRA can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Infections Serious, including fatal (18/442; 4%), infections occurred in 31% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N = 442). The most common serious infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and lower respiratory infections. Median time to onset of any grade infection was 3 months (range: 1 day to 32 months), with 75% of cases occurring within 6 months. Treat infections prior to initiation of COPIKTRA. Advise patients to report any new or worsening signs and symptoms of infection. For grade 3 or higher infection, withhold COPIKTRA until infection has resolved. Resume COPIKTRA at the same or reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Serious, including fatal, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) occurred in 1% of patients taking COPIKTRA. Provide prophylaxis for PJP during treatment with COPIKTRA. Following completion of COPIKTRA treatment, continue PJP prophylaxis until the absolute CD4+ T cell count is greater than 200 cells/µL. Withhold COPIKTRA in patients with suspected PJP of any grade, and permanently discontinue if PJP is confirmed. CMV reactivation/infection occurred in 1% of patients taking COPIKTRA. Consider prophylactic antivirals during COPIKTRA treatment to prevent CMV infection including CMV reactivation. For clinical CMV infection or viremia, withhold COPIKTRA until infection or viremia resolves. If COPIKTRA is resumed, administer the same or reduced dose and monitor patients for CMV reactivation by PCR or antigen test at least monthly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.2 Diarrhea or Colitis Serious, including fatal (1/442; <1%), diarrhea or colitis occurred in 18% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N = 442). The median time to onset of any grade diarrhea or colitis was 4 months (range: 1 day to 33 months), with 75% of cases occurring by 8 months. The median event duration was 0.5 months (range: 1 day to 29 months; 75 th percentile: 1 month). Advise patients to report any new or worsening diarrhea. For non-infectious diarrhea or colitis, follow the guidelines below: For patients presenting with mild or moderate diarrhea (Grade 1-2) (i.e. up to 6 stools per day over baseline) or asymptomatic (Grade 1) colitis, initiate supportive care with antidiarrheal agents as appropriate, continue COPIKTRA at the current dose, and monitor the patient at least weekly until the event resolves. If the diarrhea is unresponsive to antidiarrheal therapy, withhold COPIKTRA and initiate supportive therapy with enteric acting steroids (e.g. budesonide). Monitor the patient at least weekly. Upon resolution of the diarrhea, consider restarting COPIKTRA at a reduced dose. For patients presenting with abdominal pain, stool with mucus or blood, change in bowel habits, peritoneal signs, or with severe diarrhea (Grade 3) (i.e. > 6 stools per day over baseline) withhold COPIKTRA and initiate supportive therapy with enteric acting steroids (e.g. budesonide) or systemic steroids. A diagnostic work-up to determine etiology, including colonoscopy, should be performed. Monitor at least weekly. Upon resolution of the diarrhea or colitis, restart COPIKTRA at a reduced dose. For recurrent Grade 3 diarrhea or recurrent colitis of any grade, discontinue COPIKTRA. Discontinue COPIKTRA for life-threatening diarrhea or colitis [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.3 Cutaneous Reactions Serious, including fatal (2/442; < 1%), cutaneous reactions occurred in 5% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N = 442). Fatal cases included drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Median time to onset of any grade cutaneous reaction was 3 months (range: 1 day to 29 months, 75th percentile: 6 months), with a median event duration of 1 month (range: 1 day to 37 months, 75th percentile: 2 months). Presenting features for the serious events were primarily described as pruritic, erythematous, or maculo-papular. Less common presenting features include exanthem, desquamation, erythroderma, skin exfoliation, keratinocyte necrosis, and papular rash. Advise patients to report any new or worsening cutaneous reactions. Review all concomitant medications and discontinue any medications potentially contributing to the event. For patients presenting with mild or moderate (Grade 1-2) cutaneous reactions, continue COPIKTRA at the current dose, initiate supportive care with emollients, anti-histamines (for pruritus), or topical steroids, and monitor the patient closely. Withhold COPIKTRA for severe (Grade 3) cutaneous reaction until resolution. Initiate supportive care with steroids (topical or systemic) or anti-histamines (for pruritus). Monitor at least weekly until resolved. Upon resolution of the event, restart COPIKTRA at a reduced dose. Discontinue COPIKTRA if severe cutaneous reaction does not improve, worsens, or recurs. For life-threatening cutaneous reactions, discontinue COPIKTRA. In patients with SJS, TEN, or DRESS of any grade, discontinue COPIKTRA [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. 5.4 Pneumonitis Serious, including fatal (1/442; < 1%), pneumonitis without an apparent infectious cause occurred in 5% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N = 442). Median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis was 4 months (range: 9 days to 27 months), with 75% of cases occurring within 9 months). The median event duration was 1 month, with 75% of cases resolving by 2 months. Withhold COPIKTRA in patients who present with new or progressive pulmonary signs and symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, interstitial infiltrates on a radiologic exam, or a decline by more than 5% in oxygen saturation and evaluate for etiology. If the pneumonitis is infectious, patients may be restarted on COPIKTRA at the previous dose once the infection, pulmonary signs and symptoms resolve. For moderate non-infectious pneumonitis (Grade 2), treat with systemic corticosteroids, and resume COPIKTRA at a reduced dose upon resolution. If non-infectious pneumonitis recurs or does not respond to steroid therapy, discontinue COPIKTRA. For severe or life-threatening non-infectious pneumonitis, discontinue COPIKTRA and treat with systemic steroids [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Grade 3 and 4 ALT and/or AST elevation developed in 8% and 2%, respectively, in patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N = 442). Two percent of patients had both an ALT or AST greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN. Median time to onset of any grade transaminase elevation was 2 months (range: 3 days to 26 months), with a median event duration of 1 month (range: 1 day to 16 months). Monitor hepatic function during treatment with COPIKTRA. For Grade 2 ALT/AST elevation (greater than 3 to 5 × ULN), maintain COPIKTRA dose and monitor at least weekly until return to less than 3 × ULN. For Grade 3 ALT/AST elevation (greater than 5 to 20 × ULN), withhold COPIKTRA and monitor at least weekly until return to less than 3 × ULN. Resume COPIKTRA at the same dose (first occurrence) or at a reduced dose for subsequent occurrence. For grade 4 ALT/AST elevation (greater than 20 × ULN) discontinue COPIKTRA [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.6 Neutropenia Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 42% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N = 442), with Grade 4 neutropenia occurring in 24% of all patients. The median time to onset of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia was 2 months (range: 3 days to 31 months), with 75% of cases occurring within 4 months. Monitor neutrophil counts at least every 2 weeks for the first 2 months of COPIKTRA therapy, and at least weekly in patients with neutrophil counts < 1.0 Gi/L (Grade 3-4). Withhold COPIKTRA in patients presenting with neutrophil counts < 0.5 Gi/L (Grade 4). Monitor until ANC is > 0.5 Gi/L, resume COPIKTRA at same dose for the first occurrence or a reduced dose for subsequent occurrence [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, COPIKTRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of duvelisib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal mortality (resorptions, post-implantation loss, and decreased viable fetuses), alterations to growth (lower fetal weights) and structural abnormalities (malformations) at maternal doses approximately 10 times and 39 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 25 mg BID in rats and rabbits, respectively . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 , 12.3 )]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been associated with COPIKTRA in clinical trials and are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information: Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Diarrhea or Colitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Cutaneous Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions ( > 20%) are diarrhea or colitis, neutropenia, rash, fatigue, pyrexia, cough, nausea, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, musculoskeletal pain, and anemia. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Secura Bio, Inc. (Secura Bio) at 1-844-973-2872, or U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely variable conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Summary of Clinical Trial Experience in B-cell Malignancies The data described below reflect exposure to COPIKTRA in two single-arm, open-label clinical trials, one open-label extension clinical trial, and one randomized, open-label, actively controlled clinical trial totaling 442 patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies primarily including CLL/SLL (69%) and FL (22%). Patients were treated with COPIKTRA 25 mg BID until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease. The median duration of exposure was 9 months (range: 0.1 to 53 months), with 36% (160/442) of patients having at least 12 months of exposure. For the 442 patients, the median age was 67 years (range: 30 to 90 years), 65% were male, 92% were White, and 93% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. Patients had a median of 2 prior therapies. The trials required hepatic transaminases at least ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN, and serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN. Patients were excluded for prior exposure to a PI3K inhibitor within 4 weeks. Fatal adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose occurred in 36 patients (8%) treated with COPIKTRA 25 mg BID. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 289 patients (65%). The most frequent serious adverse reactions that occurred were infection (31%), diarrhea or colitis (18%), pneumonia (17%), rash (5%), and pneumonitis (5%). Adverse reactions resulted in treatment discontinuation in 156 patients (35%), most often due to diarrhea or colitis, infection, and rash. COPIKTRA was dose reduced in 104 patients (24%) due to adverse reactions, most often due to diarrhea or colitis and transaminase elevation. The median time to first dose modification or discontinuation was 4 months (range: 0.1 to 27 months), with 75% of patients having their first dose modification or discontinuation within 7 months. Common Adverse Reactions Table 4 summarizes common adverse reactions in patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID, and Table 5 summarizes the treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥ 20% of patients) were diarrhea or colitis, neutropenia, rash, fatigue, pyrexia, cough, nausea, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, musculoskeletal pain, and anemia.

Summary of Clinical Trial Experience in CLL/SLL Study 1 The safety data below reflects exposure in a randomized, open-label, actively controlled clinical trial for adult patients with CLL or SLL who received at least one prior therapy. Of 313 patients treated, 158 received COPIKTRA monotherapy and 155 received ofatumumab. The 442-patient safety analysis above includes patients from Study 1. COPIKTRA was administered at 25 mg BID in 28-day treatment cycles until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease. The comparator group received 12 doses of ofatumumab with an initial dose of 300 mg intravenous (IV) on Day 1 followed a week later by 7 weekly doses of 2000 mg IV, followed 4 weeks later by 2000 mg IV every 4 weeks for 4 doses. In the total study population, the median age was 69 years (range: 39 to 90 years), 60% were male, 92% were White, and 91% had an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1. Patients had a median of 2 prior therapies, with 61% of patients having received 2 or more prior therapies. The trial required a hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL and platelets ≥ 10,000 µL with or without transfusion support, hepatic transaminases ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN, and serum creatinine ≤ 2 times ULN. The trial excluded patients with prior autologous transplant within 6 months or allogeneic transplant, prior exposure to a PI3K inhibitor or a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, and uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] During randomized treatment, the median duration of exposure to COPIKTRA was 11.6 months with 72% (114/158) exposed for ≥ 6 months and 49% (77/158) exposed for ≥ 1 year. The median duration of exposure to ofatumumab was 5.3 months, with 77% (120/155) receiving at least 10 of 12 doses. Fatal adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose occurred in 12% (19/158) of patients treated with COPIKTRA and in 4% (7/155) of patients treated with ofatumumab. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 73% (115/158) of patients treated with COPIKTRA and most often involved infection (38% of patients; 60/158) and diarrhea or colitis (23% of patients; 36/158). COPIKTRA was discontinued in 57 patients (36%), most often due to diarrhea or colitis, infection, and rash. COPIKTRA was dose reduced in 46 patients (29%) due to adverse reactions, most often due to diarrhea or colitis and rash. Common Adverse Reactions Table 6 summarizes selected adverse reactions in Study 1, and Table 7 summarizes treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. The most common adverse reactions with COPIKTRA (reported in ≥ 20% of patients) were diarrhea or colitis, neutropenia, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, rash, fatigue, nausea, anemia and cough.

Reduce COPIKTRA dosage when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreases duvelisib area under the curve (AUC) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce COPIKTRA efficacy. Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with COPIKTRA. If coadministration with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided, increase the COPIKTRA dose.

( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, COPIKTRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of duvelisib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal mortality (resorptions, post-implantation loss, and decreased viable fetuses), alterations to growth (lower fetal weights) and structural abnormalities (malformations) at maternal doses 10 times and 39 times the MRHD of 25 mg BID in rats and rabbits, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in rats, pregnant animals received daily oral doses of duvelisib of 0, 10, 50, 150 and 275 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. Administration of duvelisib at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg/day resulted in adverse developmental outcomes including reduced fetal weights and external abnormalities (bent tail and fetal anasarca), and doses ≥ 150 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal toxicity including mortality and no live fetuses (100% resorption) in surviving dams. In another study in pregnant rats receiving oral doses of duvelisib up to 35 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis, no maternal or embryo-fetal effects were observed. The dose of 50 mg/kg/day in rats is approximately 10 -times the MRHD of 25 mg BID. In an embryo-fetal development study in rabbits, pregnant animals received daily oral doses of duvelisib of 0, 25, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. Administration of duvelisib at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal toxicity (body weight losses or lower mean body weights and increased mortality) and adverse developmental outcomes (increased resorptions and post-implantation loss, abortion, and decreased numbers of viable fetuses). In another study in pregnant rabbits receiving oral doses of duvelisib up to 75 mg/kg/day, no maternal or embryo-fetal effects were observed. The dose of 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits is approximately 39 times the MRHD of 25 mg BID. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of duvelisib and/or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from duvelisib in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking COPIKTRA and for 1 month after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential COPIKTRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing before initiation of COPIKTRA treatment. Contraception Females Based on animal studies, COPIKTRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with COPIKTRA and for 1 month after the last dose. Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with COPIKTRA and for 1 month after the last dose. Infertility Based on testicular findings in animals, male fertility may be impaired by treatment with COPIKTRA [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . There are no data on the effect of COPIKTRA on human fertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of COPIKTRA have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric studies have not been conducted. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of COPIKTRA included 270 patients (61%) that were 65 years of age and older and 104 (24%) that were 75 years of age and older. No major differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients less than 65 years of age and patients 65 years of age and older."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Duvelisib is an inhibitor of PI3K with inhibitory activity predominantly against PI3K-δ and PI3K-γ isoforms expressed in normal and malignant B-cells. Duvelisib induced growth inhibition and reduced viability in cell lines derived from malignant B-cells and in primary CLL tumor cells. Duvelisib inhibits several key cell-signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor signaling and CXCR12-mediated chemotaxis of malignant B-cells. Additionally, duvelisib inhibits CXCL12-induced T cell migration and M-CSF and IL-4 driven M2 polarization of macrophages. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics At the recommended dose of 25 mg BID, reductions in levels of phosphorylated AKT (a downstream marker for PI3K inhibition) were observed in patients treated with COPIKTRA. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of multiple doses of COPIKTRA 25 and 75 mg BID on the QTc interval was evaluated in patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies. Increases of > 20 ms in the QTc interval were not observed. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Duvelisib exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner over a dose range of 8 mg to 75 mg twice daily (0.3 to 3 times the recommended dosage). At steady state following 25 mg BID administration of duvelisib in patients, the geometric mean (CV%) maximum concentration (C max ) was 1.5 (64%) µg/mL and AUC was 7.9 (77%) µg•h/mL. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of 25 mg duvelisib after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers was 42%. The median time to peak concentration (T max ) was observed at 1 to 2 hours in patients. Effect of Food COPIKTRA may be administered without regard to food. The administration of a single dose of COPIKTRA with a high-fat meal (fat accounted for approximately 50% of the total caloric content of the meal) decreased C max by approximately 37% and decreased the AUC by approximately 6%, relative to fasting conditions. Distribution Protein binding of duvelisib is greater than 98% with no concentration dependence. The mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.5. The geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V ss /F) is 28.5 L (62%). Duvelisib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP in vitro. Elimination The geometric mean (CV%) apparent systemic clearance at steady-state is 4.2 L/hr (56%) in patients with lymphoma or leukemia. The geometric mean (CV%) terminal elimination half-life of duvelisib is 4.7 hours (57%). Metabolism Duvelisib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 CYP3A4. Excretion Following a single 25 mg oral dose of radiolabeled duvelisib, 79% of the radioactivity was excreted in feces (11% unchanged) and 14% was excreted in the urine (< 1% unchanged). Specific Populations Age (18 to 90 years), sex, race, renal impairment (creatinine clearance 23 to 80 mL/ min), hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A, B, and C) and body weight (40 to 154 kg) had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of duvelisib. Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of a single COPIKTRA 10 mg dose with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) at 200 mg BID for 5 days in healthy adults increased duvelisib C max by 1.7-fold and AUC by 4-fold. Based on physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation, the increase in duvelisib exposure at steady state is estimated to be ~2-fold when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . PBPK modeling and simulation estimated no effect on duvelisib exposures from concomitantly used mild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of a single COPIKTRA 25 mg dose with rifampin (strong CYP3A4 inducer) 600 mg once daily for 7 days in healthy adults decreased duvelisib C max by 66% and AUC by 82% [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Co-administration of etravirine (moderate CYP3A4 inducer) 200 mg twice daily of etravirine for 12 days with a single COPIKTRA 25 mg dose in healthy adults decreased duvelisib C max by 16% and AUC by 35%. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . CYP3A4 Substrates Coadministration of multiple doses of COPIKTRA 25 mg BID for 5 days with a single midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) 2 mg dose in healthy adults increased the midazolam AUC by 4.3-fold and C max by 2.2-fold [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . In Vitro Studies Duvelisib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer-resistant protein (BCRP). Duvelisib does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, or P-gp."

        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Duvelisib is an inhibitor of PI3K with inhibitory activity predominantly against PI3K-δ and PI3K-γ isoforms expressed in normal and malignant B-cells. Duvelisib induced growth inhibition and reduced viability in cell lines derived from malignant B-cells and in primary CLL tumor cells. Duvelisib inhibits several key cell-signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor signaling and CXCR12-mediated chemotaxis of malignant B-cells.

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Study 1 A randomized, multicenter, open-label trial (Study 1; NCT02004522) compared COPIKTRA versus ofatumumab in 319 adult patients with CLL (N = 312) or SLL (N = 7) after at least one prior therapy. The trial excluded patients with prior autologous transplant within 6 months or allogeneic transplant, prior exposure to a PI3K inhibitor or a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. The trial required hepatic transaminases ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN, and serum creatinine ≤ 2 times ULN. The study randomized patients with a 1:1 ratio to receive either COPIKTRA 25 mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or ofatumumab for 7 cycles. Ofatumumab was administered intravenously at an initial dose of 300 mg, followed one week later by 2000 mg once weekly for 7 doses, and then 2000 mg once every 4 weeks for 4 additional doses. The approval of COPIKTRA was based on efficacy and safety analysis of patients with at least 2 prior lines of therapy, where the benefit:risk appeared greater in this more heavily pretreated population compared to the overall trial population. In this subset (95 randomized to COPIKTRA, 101 to ofatumumab), the median patient age was 69 years (range: 40 to 90 years), 59% were male, and 88% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Forty-six percent received 2 prior lines of therapy, and 54% received 3 or more prior lines. At baseline, 52% of patients had at least one tumor ≥ 5 cm, and 22% of patients had a documented 17p deletion. During randomized treatment, the median duration of exposure to COPIKTRA was 13 months (range: 0.2 to 37), with 80% of patients receiving at least 6 months and 52% receiving at least 12 months of COPIKTRA. The median duration of exposure to ofatumumab was 5 months (range: < 0.1 to 6). Efficacy was based on progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). Other efficacy measures included overall response rate. Efficacy of COPIKTRA compared to ofatumumab specifically in patients treated with at least two prior therapies is presented in Table 8 and Figure 1. Table 8.
