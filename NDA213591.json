        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis : Monitor for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue TABRECTA in patients with ILD/pneumonitis. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests. Withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TABRECTA based on severity. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) Risk of Photosensitivity : May cause photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to limit direct ultraviolet exposure. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis ILD/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, occurred in patients treated with TABRECTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 4.5% of patients treated with TABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1, with 1.8% of patients experiencing Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis and one patient experiencing death (0.3%). Eight patients (2.4%) discontinued TABRECTA due to ILD/pneumonitis. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher ILD/pneumonitis was 1.4 months (range: 0.2 months to 1.2 years). Monitor for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold TABRECTA in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with TABRECTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 13% of patients treated with TABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1. Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT/AST occurred in 6% of patients. Three patients (0.9%) discontinued TABRECTA due to increased ALT/AST. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher increased ALT/AST was 1.4 months (range: 0.5 to 4.1 months). Monitor liver function tests (including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of TABRECTA, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop increased transaminases or bilirubin. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TABRECTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 5.3 Risk of Photosensitivity Based on findings from animal studies, there is a potential risk of photosensitivity reactions with TABRECTA [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)] . In GEOMETRY mono-1, it was recommended that patients use precautionary measures against ultraviolet exposure such as use of sunscreen or protective clothing during treatment with TABRECTA. Advise patients to limit direct ultraviolet exposure during treatment with TABRECTA. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TABRECTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Oral administration of capmatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations at exposures less than the human exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] ."

Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of TABRECTA was evaluated in GEOMETRY mono-1 [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Patients received TABRECTA 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (N = 334). Among patients who received TABRECTA, 31% were exposed for at least 6 months and 16% were exposed for at least one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 51% of patients who received TABRECTA. Serious adverse reactions in ≥ 2% of patients included dyspnea (7%), pneumonia (4.8%), pleural effusion (3.6%), general physical health deterioration (3%), vomiting (2.4%), and nausea (2.1%). A fatal adverse reaction occurred in one patient (0.3%) due to pneumonitis. Permanent discontinuation of TABRECTA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 1%) leading to permanent discontinuation of TABRECTA were peripheral edema (1.8%), pneumonitis (1.8%), and fatigue (1.5%). Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 54% of patients who received TABRECTA. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in > 2% of patients who received TABRECTA included peripheral edema, increased blood creatinine, nausea, vomiting, increased lipase, increased ALT, dyspnea, increased amylase, increased AST, increased blood bilirubin, fatigue, and pneumonia. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 23% of patients who received TABRECTA. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reductions in > 2% of patients who received TABRECTA included peripheral edema, increased ALT, increased blood creatinine, and nausea. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients who received TABRECTA were peripheral edema, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions in GEOMETRY mono-1. Table 3: Adverse Reactions (≥ 10%) in Patients Who Received TABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1 a Only includes Grade 3 adverse reactions with exception of dyspnea.

Closely monitor patients for adverse reactions during coadministration of TABRECTA with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of TABRECTA with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased capmatinib exposure. Coadministration of TABRECTA with a moderate CYP3A inducer may also decrease capmatinib exposure. Decreases in capmatinib exposure may decrease TABRECTA anti-tumor activity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Avoid coadministration of TABRECTA with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers. 7.2 Effect of TABRECTA on Other Drugs CYP1A2 Substrates Coadministration of TABRECTA increased the exposure of a CYP1A2 substrate, which may increase the adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . If coadministration is unavoidable between TABRECTA and CYP1A2 substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions, decrease the CYP1A2 substrate dosage in accordance with the approved prescribing information.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] , TABRECTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on TABRECTA use in pregnant women. Oral administration of capmatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations at maternal exposures less than the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain and food consumption) occurred at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.4 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose). Fetal effects included reduced fetal weights, irregular/incomplete ossification, and increased incidences of fetal malformations (e.g., abnormal flexure/inward malrotation of hindpaws/forepaws, thinness of forelimbs, lack of/reduced flexion at the humerus/ulna joints, and narrowed or small tongue) at doses of ≥ 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose). In rabbits, no maternal effects were detected at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose). Fetal effects included small lung lobe at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.016 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose), and reduced fetal weights, irregular/incomplete ossification and increased incidences of fetal malformations (e.g., abnormal flexure/malrotation of hindpaws/forepaws, thinness of forelimbs/hindlimbs, lack of/reduced flexion at the humerus/ulna joints, small lung lobes, narrowed or small tongue) at the dose of 60 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of capmatinib or its metabolites in either human or animal milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on animal data, TABRECTA can cause malformations at doses less than the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status for females of reproductive potential prior to starting treatment with TABRECTA. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of TABRECTA in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In GEOMETRY mono-1, 57% of the 334 patients were 65 years or older and 16% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in the safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (baseline creatinine clearance [CLcr] 60 to 89 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault) or moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . TABRECTA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min)."

Oral administration of capmatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations at maternal exposures less than the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In rats, maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain and food consumption) occurred at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.4 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose). Fetal effects included reduced fetal weights, irregular/incomplete ossification, and increased incidences of fetal malformations (e.g., abnormal flexure/inward malrotation of hindpaws/forepaws, thinness of forelimbs, lack of/reduced flexion at the humerus/ulna joints, and narrowed or small tongue) at doses of ≥ 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose). In rabbits, no maternal effects were detected at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose). Fetal effects included small lung lobe at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.016 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose), and reduced fetal weights, irregular/incomplete ossification and increased incidences of fetal malformations (e.g., abnormal flexure/malrotation of hindpaws/forepaws, thinness of forelimbs/hindlimbs, lack of/reduced flexion at the humerus/ulna joints, small lung lobes, narrowed or small tongue) at the dose of 60 mg/kg/day."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Capmatinib is a kinase inhibitor that targets MET, including the mutant variant produced by exon 14 skipping. MET exon 14 skipping results in a protein with a missing regulatory domain that reduces its negative regulation leading to increased downstream MET signaling. Capmatinib inhibited cancer cell growth driven by a mutant MET variant lacking exon 14 at clinically achievable concentrations and demonstrated anti-tumor activity in murine tumor xenograft models derived from human lung tumors with either a mutation leading to MET exon 14 skipping or MET amplification. Capmatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of MET triggered by binding of hepatocyte growth factor or by MET amplification, as well as MET-mediated phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins and proliferation and survival of MET-dependent cancer cells. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-Response Capmatinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown. Cardiac Electrophysiology No large mean increase in QTc (i.e. > 20 ms) was detected following treatment with TABRECTA at the recommended dosage of 400 mg orally twice daily. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Capmatinib exposure (AUC 0-12h and C max ) increased approximately proportionally over a dose range of 200 mg (0.5 times the recommended dosage) to 400 mg. Capmatinib reached steady-state by day 3 following twice daily dosing, with a mean (% coefficient of variation [%CV]) accumulation ratio of 1.5 (41%). Absorption After administration of TABRECTA 400 mg orally in patients with cancer, capmatinib peak plasma concentrations (C max ) were reached in approximately 1 to 2 hours (T max ). The absorption of capmatinib after oral administration is estimated to be greater than 70%. Effect of Food A high-fat meal (containing approximately 1000 calories and 50% fat) in healthy subjects increased capmatinib AUC 0-INF by 46% with no change in C max compared to under fasted conditions. A low-fat meal (containing approximately 300 calories and 20% fat) in healthy subjects had no clinically meaningful effect on capmatinib exposure. When capmatinib was administered at 400 mg orally twice daily in cancer patients, exposure (AUC 0-12h ) was similar after administration of capmatinib with food and under fasted conditions. Distribution Capmatinib plasma protein binding is 96%, independent of capmatinib concentration. The apparent mean volume of distribution at steady-state is 164 L. The blood-to-plasma ratio was 1.5, but decreased at higher concentrations to 0.9. Elimination The effective elimination half-life of capmatinib is 6.5 hours. The mean (%CV) steady-state apparent clearance of capmatinib is 24 L/hr (82%). Metabolism Capmatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and aldehyde oxidase. Excretion Following a single oral administration of radiolabeled-capmatinib to healthy subjects, 78% of the total radioactivity was recovered in feces with 42% as unchanged and 22% was recovered in urine with negligible as unchanged. Specific Populations No clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetic parameters of capmatinib were identified for the following covariates assessed: age (26 to 90 years), sex, race (White, Asian, Native American, Black, unknown), body weight (35 to 131 kg), mild to moderate renal impairment (baseline CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault) and mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification). The effect of severe renal impairment (baseline CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) on capmatinib pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) increased capmatinib AUC 0-INF by 42% with no change in capmatinib C max . Strong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with rifampicin (a strong CYP3A inducer) decreased capmatinib AUC 0-INF by 67% and decreased C max by 56%. Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with efavirenz (a moderate CYP3A inducer) was predicted to decrease capmatinib AUC 0-12h by 44% and decrease C max by 34%. Proton Pump Inhibitors: Coadministration with rabeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) decreased capmatinib AUC 0-INF by 25% and decreased C max by 38%. Substrates of CYP Enzymes: Coadministration of capmatinib increased caffeine (a CYP1A2 substrate) AUC 0-INF by 134% with no change in its C max . Coadministration of capmatinib had no clinically meaningful effect on exposure of midazolam (a CYP3A substrate). P-gp Substrates: Coadministration of capmatinib increased digoxin (a P-gp substrate) AUC 0-INF by 47% and increased C max by 74%. BCRP Substrates: Coadministration of capmatinib increased rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate) AUC 0-INF by 108% and increased C max by 204%. In Vitro Studies Transporter Systems: Capmatinib is a substrate of P-gp, but not a substrate of BCRP or MRP2. Capmatinib reversibly inhibits MATE1 and MATE2K, but does not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3, or MRP2."

Capmatinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay and did not cause chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Capmatinib was not clastogenic in an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in rats. Dedicated fertility studies were not conducted with capmatinib. No effects on male and female reproductive organs occurred in general toxicology studies conducted in rats and monkeys at doses resulting in exposures of up to approximately 3.6 times the human exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In rats, capmatinib administration resulted in vacuolation of white matter of the brain in both 4- and 13-week studies at doses ≥ 2.2 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose. In some cases, the brain lesions were associated with early death and/or convulsions or tremors. Concentrations of capmatinib in the brain tissue of rats was approximately 9% of the corresponding concentrations in plasma. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that capmatinib has some potential for photosensitization; however, the no-observed-adverse-effect level for in vivo photosensitization was 30 mg/kg/day (C max of 14000 ng/mL), about 2.9 times the human C max at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Metastatic NSCLC with a Mutation that Leads to MET Exon 14 Skipping The efficacy of TABRECTA was evaluated in GEOMETRY mono-1, a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort study (NCT02414139). Eligible patients were required to have NSCLC with a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) negative status, and at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases, clinically significant uncontrolled cardiac disease, or who received treatment with any MET or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibitor were not eligible for the study. Out of the 97 patients enrolled in GEOMETRY mono-1 following the central confirmation of MET exon 14 skipping by a RNA-based clinical trial assay, 78 patient samples were retested with the FDA-approved FoundationOne ® CDx (22 treatment-naïve and 56 previously treated patients) to detect mutations that lead to MET exon 14 skipping. Out of 78 samples retested with FoundationOne ® CDx, 73 samples were evaluable (20 treatment-naïve and 53 previously treated patients), 72 (20 treatment-naïve and 52 previously treated patients) of which were confirmed to have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping, demonstrating an estimated positive percentage agreement of 99% (72/73) between the clinical trial assay and the FDA-approved assay. Patients received TABRECTA 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) as determined by a Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) according to RECIST 1.1. An additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR) by BIRC. The efficacy population included 28 treatment-naïve patients and 69 previously treated patients. The median age was 71 years (range: 49 to 90 years); 60% female; 75% White; 24% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0 and 75% had ECOG PS 1; 60% never smoked; 80% had adenocarcinoma; and 12% had CNS metastases. Amongst previously treated patients, 88% received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Efficacy results are presented in Table 5.
