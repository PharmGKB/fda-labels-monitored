        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New Primary Malignancies, Cutaneous and Non-Cutaneous : Can occur when TAFINLAR is administered as a single agent or with trametinib. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to, or while on therapy, and following discontinuation of treatment. ( 5.1 , 2.4 ) Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-type Tumors : Increased cell proliferation can occur with BRAF inhibitors. ( 5.2 , 2.1 ) Hemorrhage : Major hemorrhagic events can occur in patients receiving TAFINLAR with trametinib. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. ( 5.3 ) Cardiomyopathy : Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before treatment with TAFINLAR and trametinib, after one month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter. ( 5.4 , 2.4 ) Uveitis : Perform ophthalmological evaluation for any visual disturbances. ( 5.5 , 2.4 ) Serious Febrile Reactions : Incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with TAFINLAR and trametinib. ( 5.6 , 2.4 ) Serious Skin Toxicities : Monitor for skin toxicities. Discontinue for intolerable Grade 2 or for Grade 3 or 4 rash not improving within 3 weeks despite interruption of TAFINLAR. Permanently discontinue for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). ( 5.7 , 2.4 ) Hyperglycemia : Monitor serum glucose levels in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. ( 5.8 ) Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency (G6PD) : Closely monitor for hemolytic anemia. ( 5.9 ) Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) : Interrupt treatment for suspected HLH. Discontinue treatment if HLH is confirmed. ( 5.11 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception. ( 5.12 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 New Primary Malignancies Cutaneous Malignancies TAFINLAR Monotherapy (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCC), and keratoacanthomas occurred in 11% and 4% of patients, respectively. Basal cell carcinoma and new primary melanoma occurred in 4% and 1% of patients, respectively. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , the incidence of cuSCC (including keratoacanthomas) occurred in 2% of patients. Basal cell carcinoma and new primary melanoma occurred in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, new primary melanoma occurred in < 1% of patients. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of TAFINLAR, every 2 months while on therapy, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of TAFINLAR. Non-Cutaneous Malignancies Based on its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR may promote the growth and development of malignancies with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . In the pooled adult safety populations of TAFINLAR monotherapy and TAFINLAR administered with trametinib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , non-cutaneous malignancies occurred in 1% of patients. Monitor patients receiving TAFINLAR for signs or symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells which are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation status prior to initiation of TAFINLAR as a single agent or in combination with trametinib [see Indications and Usage (1.6), Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . 5.3 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage, including major hemorrhage defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur when TAFINLAR is administered with trametinib. Fatal cases have been reported. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , hemorrhagic events occurred in 17% of patients; gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients; intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 0.6% of patients; fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.5% of patients. The fatal events were cerebral hemorrhage and brainstem hemorrhage. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, hemorrhagic events occurred in 25% of patients; the most common type of bleeding was epistaxis (16%). Serious events of bleeding occurred in 3.6% of patients and included gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1.2%), cerebral hemorrhage (0.6%) uterine hemorrhage (0.6%), post-procedural hemorrhage (0.6%), and epistaxis (0.6%). Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any Grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold TAFINLAR for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved, resume at the next lower dose level. 5.4 Cardiomyopathy TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 10% from baseline and below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN), occurred in 6% of patients. Development of cardiomyopathy resulted in dose interruption or discontinuation of TAFINLAR in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 45 of 50 patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in LVEF ≥ 10% from baseline and below the institutional LLN, occurred in 9% of patients. Assess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib, one month after initiation, and then at 2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment. Withhold TAFINLAR for symptomatic cardiomyopathy or asymptomatic LV dysfunction of > 20% from baseline that is below institutional LLN. Resume TAFINLAR at the same dose level upon recovery of cardiac function to at least the institutional LLN for LVEF and absolute decrease ≤ 10% compared to baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.5 Uveitis TAFINLAR Monotherapy (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , uveitis occurred in 1% of patients. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , uveitis occurred in 2% of patients. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, uveitis occurred in 1.2% of patients. Treatment employed in clinical trials included steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops. Monitor patients for visual signs and symptoms of uveitis (e.g., change in vision, photophobia, eye pain). If iritis is diagnosed, administer ocular therapy and continue TAFINLAR without dose modification. If severe uveitis (i.e., iridocyclitis) or if mild or moderate uveitis does not respond to ocular therapy, withhold TAFINLAR and treat as clinically indicated. Resume TAFINLAR at the same or lower dose if improves to Grade 0 or 1. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for persistent Grade 2 or greater uveitis of > 6 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.6 Serious Febrile Reactions Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur with TAFINLAR. The incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased when TAFINLAR is administered with trametinib compared with TAFINLAR as a single agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . TAFINLAR Monotherapy (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , fever (serious and non-serious) occurred in 30% of patients. Approximately 13% of these patients experienced 3 or more discrete episodes. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills occurred in 6% of patients. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration or renal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%, dehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in < 1% of patients. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients. Withhold TAFINLAR when used as monotherapy, and both TAFINLAR and trametinib when used in combination, if the patient’s temperature is ≥ 100.4°F. In case of recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection and monitor serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe pyrexia. If appropriate, TAFINLAR, or both TAFINLAR and trametinib when used in combination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for at least 24 hours, either at the same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Administer antipyretics as secondary prophylaxis when resuming TAFINLAR if patient had a prior episode of severe febrile reaction or fever associated with complications. Administer corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 10 mg daily) for at least 5 days for second or subsequent pyrexia if temperature does not return to baseline within 3 days of onset of pyrexia, or for pyrexia associated with complications, such as dehydration, hypotension, renal failure, or severe chills/rigors, and there is no evidence of active infection. 5.7 Serious Skin Toxicities Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with TAFINLAR administered with trametinib [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , other serious skin toxicity occurred in < 1% of patients. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, serious adverse events of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders occurred in 1.8% of patients. Monitor for new or worsening serious skin reactions. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for SCARs [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . For other skin toxicities, withhold TAFINLAR for intolerable or severe skin toxicity. Resume TAFINLAR at a lower dose in patients with improvement or recovery from skin toxicity within 3 weeks. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR if skin toxicity has not improved within 3 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.8 Hyperglycemia TAFINLAR Monotherapy (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , 14% of patients with a history of diabetes that received TAFINLAR required more intensive hypoglycemic therapy. Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia occurred in 3% of patients. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , 15% of patients with a history of diabetes who had received TAFINLAR with trametinib required more intensive hypoglycemic therapy. Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia occurred in 2% of patients. TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia events occurred in < 1% of patients. Monitor serum glucose levels upon initiation and as clinically appropriate when TAFINLAR is administered in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated. 5.9 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency TAFINLAR, which contains a sulfonamide moiety, confers a potential risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Monitor patients with G6PD deficiency for signs of hemolytic anemia while taking TAFINLAR. 5.10 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment TAFINLAR is indicated for use in combination with trametinib. Review the prescribing information for trametinib for information on the serious risks of trametinib prior to initiation of TAFINLAR with trametinib. 5.11 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been observed in the post-marketing setting when TAFINLAR was administered with trametinib. If HLH is suspected, interrupt treatment. If HLH is confirmed, discontinue treatment and initiate appropriate management of HLH. 5.12 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Dabrafenib was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human exposure at the recommended adult clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception, since TAFINLAR can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks after the last dose [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] ."

Adult Safety Pools The TAFINLAR monotherapy pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to TAFINLAR 150 mg orally, taken twice daily as a single agent in 586 patients with various solid tumors, including BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, enrolled in BREAK-2, BREAK-3, BREAK-MB, BRF113220, and BRF112680. Among these 586 patients who received TAFINLAR as a single agent, 46% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 15% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population for TAFINLAR administered with trametinib (Adult) described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to TAFINLAR 150 mg orally, twice daily administered in combination with trametinib 2 mg orally, once daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, MEK111504, COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based TAFINLAR orally, twice daily administered in combination with trametinib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, 84% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 70% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma TAFINLAR as a Single Agent The safety of TAFINLAR was evaluated in BREAK-3, a multi-center, international, open-label, randomized (3:1), controlled trial allocated 250 patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily (n = 187) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 63) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . The trial excluded patients with abnormal LVEF or cardiac valve morphology (≥ Grade 2), corrected QT interval ≥ 480 milliseconds on electrocardiogram, or a known history of G6PD deficiency. The median duration on treatment was 4.9 months for patients treated with TAFINLAR and 2.8 months for dacarbazine-treated patients. The population exposed to TAFINLAR was 60% male, 99% White, and had a median age of 53 years. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients treated with TAFINLAR were, in order of decreasing frequency: hyperkeratosis, headache, pyrexia, arthralgia, papilloma, alopecia, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES). The incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication in the BREAK-3 study was 3% for patients treated with TAFINLAR and 3% for patients treated with dacarbazine. The most frequent (≥ 2%) adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of TAFINLAR were pyrexia (9%), PPES (3%), chills (3%), fatigue (2%), and headache (2%).

Nine patients crossed over from the carboplatin plus vincristine arm to the TAFINLAR and trametinib arm. Pediatric patients received weight-based TAFINLAR orally twice daily administered in combination with trametinib until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients in the control arm received carboplatin and vincristine at doses of 175 mg/m 2 and 1.5 mg/m 2 , respectively in 10-week induction course followed by eight 6-week cycles of maintenance therapy or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Among patients with low-grade glioma who were randomized to TAFINLAR plus trametinib (n = 73), 95% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 71% were exposed for greater than one year. The median age of these patients was 10 years (range: 1 to 17); 60% female; 75% White, 7% Asian, 2.7% Black or African American, 4% other race and 11% where race was unknown or not reported. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of these patients. Serious adverse reactions in > 3% of patients included pyrexia (14%) and vomiting (4%). Permanent discontinuation of TAFINLAR due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of TAFINLAR included chills, fatigue, pyrexia, weight increased, and headache. Dosage interruptions of TAFINLAR due to an adverse reaction occurred in 73% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in > 5% of patients included pyrexia (53%). Dose reductions of TAFINLAR due to an adverse reaction occurred in 48% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in > 2% of patients included rash (2.7%). The most common (≥ 15%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (68%), rash (51%), headache (47%), vomiting (34%), musculoskeletal pain (34%), fatigue (33%), diarrhea (29%), dry skin (26%), nausea (25%), hemorrhage (25%), abdominal pain (25%), dermatitis acneiform (22%), dizziness (15%), upper respiratory tract infection (15%), and weight increased (15%). The most common (≥ 20%) laboratory abnormalities that worsened from baseline were leukopenia (59%), increased alkaline phosphatase (55%), anemia (46%), decreased neutrophils (44%), increased AST (37%), decreased magnesium (34%), increased magnesium (32%), decreased platelets (30%), increased ALT (29%), and increased lymphocytes (24%).

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concurrent administration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8. ( 7.1 ) Concomitant use with agents that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6 may result in loss of efficacy of these agents. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on TAFINLAR Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 may increase the concentration of dabrafenib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Substitution of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 is recommended during treatment with TAFINLAR. If concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 is unavoidable, monitor patients closely for adverse reactions when taking strong inhibitors. 7.2 Effects of TAFINLAR on Other Drugs Dabrafenib decreased the systemic exposures of midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate), S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate), and R-warfarin (a CYP3A4/CYP1A2 substrate) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) levels more frequently in patients receiving warfarin during initiation or discontinuation of dabrafenib. Coadministration of TAFINLAR with other substrates of these enzymes, including dexamethasone or hormonal contraceptives , can result in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8. 3 )] . Substitute for these medications or monitor patients for loss of efficacy if use of these medications is unavoidable."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Do not breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : May impair fertility. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] , TAFINLAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There is insufficient data in pregnant women exposed to TAFINLAR to assess the risks. Dabrafenib was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human exposure at the recommended adult clinical dose of 150 mg twice daily (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a combined female fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats conducted during the period of organogenesis, developmental toxicity consisted of embryo-lethality, ventricular septal defects, and variation in thymic shape at a dabrafenib dose of 300 mg/kg/day [approximately three times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on area under the curve (AUC)]. At doses of 20 mg/kg/day or greater (equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC), rats demonstrated delays in skeletal development and reduced fetal body weight. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of dabrafenib in human milk, or the effects of dabrafenib on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks following the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TAFINLAR. Contraception Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 )]. Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks after the last dose. Counsel patients to use a non-hormonal method of contraception since TAFINLAR can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Males To avoid potential drug exposure to pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive potential, advise male patients (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential that TAFINLAR may impair fertility. A reduction in fertility was observed in female rats at dose exposures equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended adult dose. A reduction in the number of corpora lutea was noted in pregnant rats at dose exposures approximately three times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Males Advise male patients of the potential risk for impaired spermatogenesis which may be irreversible. Effects on spermatogenesis have been observed in animals treated with dabrafenib at dose exposures up to three times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors and LGG The safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options; or with LGG with BRAF V600E mutation who require systemic therapy. Use of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib for these indications is supported by evidence from studies X2101 and G2201 that enrolled 171 patients (1 to < 18 years) with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced solid tumors, of which 4 (2.3%) patients were 1 to < 2 years of age, 39 (23%) patients were 2 to < 6 years of age, 54 (32%) patients were 6 to < 12 years of age, and 74 (43%) patients were 12 to < 18 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . The safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib have not been established for these indications in pediatric patients less than 1 year old. The safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR as a single agent in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a repeat-dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, an increased incidence of kidney cysts and tubular deposits were noted at doses as low as 0.2 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC. Additionally, forestomach hyperplasia, decreased bone length, and early vaginal opening were noted at doses as low as 0.8 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 586 patients with various solid tumors who received single agent TAFINLAR, 22% were aged 65 years and older. Of the 187 patients with melanoma who received single-agent TAFINLAR in the BREAK-3 study, 21% were aged 65 years or older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . No overall differences in the effectiveness or safety of TAFINLAR were observed between geriatric patients as compared to younger adults in the BREAK-3 study. Of the 994 patients with melanoma who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib in the COMBI-d, COMBI-v, and COMBI-AD studies [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)] , 21% were aged 65 years and older and 5% were aged 75 years and older. No overall differences in the effectiveness of TAFINLAR plus trametinib were observed in geriatric patients as compared to younger adults across these melanoma studies. The incidences of peripheral edema (26% vs. 12%) and anorexia (21% vs. 9%) were increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger adults in these studies. Of the 171 patients with NSCLC who received TAFINLAR in Study BRF113928, there were insufficient numbers of geriatric patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] . Of the 26 patients with ATC who received TAFINLAR in Study BRF117019, 77% were aged 65 years and older, and 31% were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] . This study in ATC did not include sufficient numbers of younger adults to determine whether they respond differently compared to geriatric patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Dose adjustment is not recommended for patients with mild (bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or bilirubin > 1x to 1.5x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. As hepatic metabolism and biliary secretion are the primary routes of elimination of dabrafenib and its metabolites, patients with moderate (bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) to severe (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment may have increased exposure. An appropriate dosage has not been established for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

Use of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib for these indications is supported by evidence from studies X2101 and G2201 that enrolled 171 patients (1 to < 18 years) with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced solid tumors, of which 4 (2.3%) patients were 1 to < 2 years of age, 39 (23%) patients were 2 to < 6 years of age, 54 (32%) patients were 6 to < 12 years of age, and 74 (43%) patients were 12 to < 18 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . The safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib have not been established for these indications in pediatric patients less than 1 year old. The safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR as a single agent in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a repeat-dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, an increased incidence of kidney cysts and tubular deposits were noted at doses as low as 0.2 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC. Additionally, forestomach hyperplasia, decreased bone length, and early vaginal opening were noted at doses as low as 0.8 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Dabrafenib is an inhibitor of some mutated forms of BRAF kinases with in vitro IC 50 values of 0.65, 0.5, and 1.84 nM for BRAF V600E, BRAF V600K, and BRAF V600D enzymes, respectively. Dabrafenib also inhibits wild-type BRAF and CRAF kinases with IC 50 values of 3.2 and 5.0 nM, respectively, and other kinases, such as SIK1, NEK11, and LIMK1 at higher concentrations. Some mutations in the BRAF gene, including those that result in BRAF V600E, can result in constitutively activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth [see Indications and Usage (1)] . Dabrafenib inhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo. Dabrafenib and trametinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Use of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination resulted in greater growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor xenografts compared with either drug alone. In the setting of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway re-activation has been identified as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors [see Indications and Usage (1.8)]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The potential effect of TAFINLAR on QT interval was assessed in a dedicated multiple-dose study in 32 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors. No large changes in the mean QT interval (i.e., > 20 ms) were detected with dabrafenib 300 mg administered twice daily (two times the recommended dosage). In clinical trials, QTc (heart rate-corrected QT) prolongation to ≥ 500 ms occurred in 0.8% of 264 patients who received TAFINLAR with trametinib and in 1.5% of patients who received TAFINLAR as a single agent. The QTc was increased > 60 ms from baseline in 3.8% of patients who received TAFINLAR with trametinib and 3% of patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration of TAFINLAR capsules, dabrafenib C max and AUC increased in a dose-proportional manner across the dose range of 12 mg (0.08 times the approved recommended adult dose) to 300 mg (2 times the approved recommended adult dose), but the increase was less than dose-proportional after steady state twice-daily dosing. After twice-daily dosing, the mean accumulation ratio was 0.7, and the inter-subject variability (CV%) of AUC at steady-state was 38%. Absorption The median time to achieve peak plasma concentration (T max ) is 2 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability of TAFINLAR capsules is 95% and TAFINLAR tablets for oral suspension is 76%. Effect of Food Following administration of TAFINLAR capsules, a high-fat meal (approximately 1000 calories, 58-75 grams fat, 58 grams carbohydrates, and 33 grams protein) decreased C max by 51%, decreased AUC by 31%, and delayed median T max by 3.6 hours as compared with the fasted state. Distribution Dabrafenib is 99.7% bound to human plasma proteins. The apparent volume of distribution (V c /F) is 70.3 L. Elimination The mean terminal half-life is 8 hours. Hydroxy-dabrafenib terminal half-life (10 hours) parallels that of dabrafenib while the carboxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib metabolites exhibit longer half-lives (21 to 22 hours). The apparent clearance of dabrafenib is 17 L/h after a single dose and 34 L/h after twice-daily dosing for 2 weeks. Metabolism The metabolism of dabrafenib is primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 to form hydroxy-dabrafenib. Hydroxy-dabrafenib is further oxidized via CYP3A4 to form carboxy-dabrafenib and subsequently excreted in bile and urine. Carboxy-dabrafenib is decarboxylated to form desmethyl-dabrafenib; desmethyl-dabrafenib may be reabsorbed from the gut. Desmethyl-dabrafenib is further metabolized by CYP3A4 to oxidative metabolites. Mean metabolite-to-parent AUC ratios following repeat-dose administration are 0.9, 11, and 0.7 for hydroxy-, carboxy-, and desmethyl-dabrafenib, respectively. Based on systemic exposure, relative potency, and pharmacokinetic properties, both hydroxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib are likely to contribute to the clinical activity of dabrafenib. Excretion Fecal excretion is the major route of elimination accounting for 71% of radioactive dose while urinary excretion accounted for 23% of total radioactivity as metabolites only. Specific Populations Age (18 to 93 years), sex, weight (36 to 170 kg), and renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) have no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib in glioma and other solid tumors were evaluated in 243 patients aged 1 to < 18 years following a single dose or multiple doses. Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients aged 1 to < 18 years are within range of values previously observed in adults give the same dose based on weight. Weight (6 to 156 kg) had a statistically significant effect on dabrafenib oral clearance in this population. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1x to 1.5x ULN and any AST) has no effect on systemic exposure to dabrafenib and its metabolites. No data are available in patients with moderate (bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) or severe (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Trametinib on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 75 mg twice daily with trametinib 2 mg daily resulted in a 23% increase in AUC of dabrafenib, a 33% increase in AUC of desmethyl-dabrafenib, and no change in AUC of hydroxy-dabrafenib as compared with administration of dabrafenib. Effect of Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 75 mg twice daily and ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) for 4 days increased dabrafenib AUC by 71%, hydroxy-dabrafenib AUC by 82%, and desmethyl-dabrafenib AUC by 68%. Coadministration of TAFINLAR 75 mg twice daily and gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) for 4 days increased dabrafenib AUC by 47%, with no change in the AUC of dabrafenib metabolites. Effect of Strong Inducers of CYP3A4 or Moderate Inducers of CYP2C8 on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C8 inducer) for 10 days decreased dabrafenib AUC by 34% and desmethyl-dabrafenib AUC by 30%, and had no effect on hydroxy-dabrafenib AUC. Effect of Acid Reducing Agents on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and rabeprazole for 4 days did not result in clinically relevant changes in exposures to dabrafenib and its metabolites. Effect of Dabrafenib on CYP Substrates: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily for 15 days and a single dose of midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) decreased midazolam AUC by 65%. Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily for 15 days and a single dose of warfarin decreased the AUC of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) by 37% and the AUC of R-warfarin (CYP3A4/CYP1A2 substrate) by 33%. In vitro data demonstrate that dabrafenib is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 via activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) nuclear receptors. Dabrafenib may also induce CYP2C enzymes via the same mechanism. Effect of Transporters on Dabrafenib: Dabrafenib and its metabolites, hydroxyl-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib, are substrates of human P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) but are not substrates of organic cation transporter (OCT1) or organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1A2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1) in vitro. Effect of Dabrafenib on Transporters: Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily with a single dose of rosuvastatin (a sensitive OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate) increased rosuvastatin C max by 2.6-fold but did not change its AUC. Dabrafenib and its metabolites, hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib, and desmethyl-dabrafenib, are inhibitors of organic anion transporter (OAT1 and OAT3) in vitro. Dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib are inhibitors of OCT2 and BCRP in vitro."

Patients with any prior use of BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibitors were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily (n = 187) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 63). Randomization was stratified by disease stage at baseline [unresectable Stage III (regional nodal or in-transit metastases), M1a (distant skin, subcutaneous, or nodal metastases), or M1b (lung metastases) versus M1c melanoma (all other visceral metastases or elevated serum LDH)]. The main efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator. In addition, an independent radiology review committee (IRRC) assessed the following efficacy outcome measures in pre-specified supportive analyses: PFS, confirmed overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DoR). The median age of patients in the BREAK-3 study was 52 years. The majority of the trial population was male (60%), White (99%), had an ECOG performance status of 0 (67%), M1c disease (66%), and normal LDH (62%). All patients had tumor tissue with mutations in BRAF V600E as determined by a clinical trial assay at a centralized testing site. Tumor samples from 243 patients (97%) were tested retrospectively, using an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test, THxID™-BRAF assay. The median durations of follow-up prior to initiation of alternative treatment in patients randomized to receive TAFINLAR was 5.1 months and in the dacarbazine arm was 3.5 months. Twenty-eight (44%) patients crossed over from the dacarbazine arm at the time of disease progression to receive TAFINLAR. The BREAK-3 study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival in the patients treated with TAFINLAR. Table 20 and Figure 1 summarize the PFS results. Table 20.

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Investigator-Assessed Progression-Free Survival in the BREAK-3 Study In supportive analyses based on IRRC assessment and in an exploratory subgroup analysis of patients with retrospectively confirmed V600E mutation-positive melanoma with the THxID™-BRAF assay, the PFS results were consistent with those of the primary efficacy analysis. BREAK-MB Study The activity of TAFINLAR for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma, metastatic to the brain was evaluated in a single-arm, open-label, two-cohort multi-center trial (the BREAK-MB study; NCT01266967). All patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily. Patients in Cohort A (n = 74) had received no prior local therapy for brain metastases, while patients in Cohort B (n = 65) had received at least one local therapy for brain metastases, including, but not limited to, surgical resection, whole brain radiotherapy, or stereotactic radiosurgery, such as gamma knife, linear-accelerated-based radiosurgery, or charged particles. In addition, patients in Cohort B were required to have evidence of disease progression in a previously treated lesion or an untreated lesion. Additional eligibility criteria were at least one measurable lesion of 0.5 cm or greater in largest diameter on contrast-enhanced MRI, stable or decreasing corticosteroid dose, and no more than two prior systemic regimens for treatment of metastatic disease. The major efficacy outcome measure was estimation of the overall intracranial response rate (OIRR) in each cohort. The median age of patients in Cohort A was 50 years, 72% were male, 100% were White, 59% had a pre-treatment ECOG performance status of 0, and 57% had an elevated LDH value at baseline. The median age of patients in Cohort B was 51 years, 63% were male, 98% were White, 66% had a pre-treatment ECOG performance status of 0, and 54% had an elevated LDH value at baseline. The intracranial response rate as determined by an independent radiology review committee, masked to investigator response assessments, was 18% (95% CI: 10%, 28%) in Cohort A and 18% (95% CI: 10%, 30%) in Cohort B. The median duration of intracranial response was 4.6 months in both cohorts. 14.2 BRAF V600E or V600K Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma – TAFINLAR With Trametinib COMBI-d Study and COMBI-v Study The safety and efficacy of TAFINLAR administered with trametinib were evaluated in two international, randomized, active-controlled trials: one double-blind trial (the COMBI-d study; NCT01584648) and one open-label trial (the COMBI-v study; NCT01597908). The COMBI-d study compared TAFINLAR and trametinib to TAFINLAR and placebo as first-line therapy for patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily or TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily plus matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by LDH level (> ULN vs. ≤ ULN) and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs. V600K). The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 with additional efficacy outcome measures of overall survival (OS) and confirmed overall response rate (ORR). The COMBI-v study compared TAFINLAR and trametinib to vemurafenib as first-line treatment therapy for patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Randomization was stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> ULN vs. ≤ ULN) and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs. V600K). The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS and ORR as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1. In the COMBI-d study, 423 patients were randomized to TAFINLAR plus trametinib (n = 211) or TAFINLAR plus placebo (n = 212). The median age was 56 years (range: 22 to 89), 53% were male, > 99% were White, 72% had ECOG performance status of 0, 4% had Stage IIIC, 66% had M1c disease, 65% had a normal LDH, and 2 patients had a history of brain metastases. All patients had tumor containing BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as determined by centralized testing with the FDA-approved companion diagnostic test; 85% with BRAF V600E mutations and 15% with BRAF V600K mutations. In the COMBI-v study, 704 patients were randomized to TAFINLAR plus trametinib (n = 352) or single-agent vemurafenib (n = 352). The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91), 96% were White, and 55% were male, 6% percent of patients had Stage IIIC, 61% had M1c disease, 67% had a normal LDH, 70% had ECOG performance status of 0, 89% had BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma, and one patient had a history of brain metastases. The COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS. Table 21 and Figures 2 and 3 summarize the efficacy results. Table 21.

Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in the COMBI-d Study Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in the COMBI-v Study COMBI-MB Study The activity of TAFINLAR with trametinib for the treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma, metastatic to the brain, was evaluated in a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort trial (the COMBI-MB study; NCT02039947). Eligible patients were required to have at least one measurable intracranial lesion and to have no leptomeningeal disease, parenchymal brain metastasis greater than 4 cm in diameter, ocular melanoma, or primary mucosal melanoma. Patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was intracranial response rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed intracranial response per RECIST v1.1, modified to allow up to five intracranial target lesions at least 5 mm in diameter, as assessed by independent review. The COMBI-MB study enrolled 121 patients with a BRAF V600E (85%) or V600K (15%) mutation. The median age was 54 years (range: 23 to 84), 58% were male, 100% were White, 8% were from the United States, 65% had a normal LDH value at baseline, and 97% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Intracranial metastases were asymptomatic in 87% and symptomatic in 13% of patients, 22% received prior local therapy for brain metastases, and 87% also had extracranial metastases. The intracranial response rate was 50% (95% CI: 41, 60), with a complete response rate of 4.1% and a partial response rate of 46%. The median duration of intracranial response was 6.4 months (range: 1 to 31). Of the patients with an intracranial response, 9% had stable or progressive disease as their best overall response. 14.3 Adjuvant Treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma COMBI-AD (NCT 01682083) was an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled patients with Stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as detected by the THxID ™ -BRAF assay and pathologic involvement of regional lymph node(s). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily or two placebos for up to 1 year. Enrollment required complete resection of melanoma with complete lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to randomization. The trial excluded patients with mucosal or ocular melanoma, unresectable in-transit metastases, distant metastatic disease, or prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, including radiotherapy. Randomization was stratified by BRAF mutation status (V600E or V600K) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC; 7 th Edition) stage (IIIa, IIIb, or IIIc). The major efficacy outcome measure was relapse-free survival (RFS), defined as the time from randomization to disease recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first as assessed by the investigator. Patients underwent imaging for tumor recurrence every 3 months for the first two years and every 6 months thereafter. In COMBI-AD, a total of 870 patients were randomized: 438 to TAFINLAR administered with trametinib and 432 to placebo. Median age was 51 years (range: 18 to 89), 55% were male, 99% were White, and 91% had an ECOG performance status of 0. Disease characteristics were AJCC Stage IIIa (18%), Stage IIIb (41%), Stage IIIc (40%), stage unknown (1%); BRAF V600E mutation (91%), BRAF V600K mutation (9%); macroscopic lymph nodes (65%); and tumor ulceration (41%). The median duration of follow-up (time from randomization to last contact or death) was 2.8 years. COMBI-AD showed a statistically significant improvement in RFS in patients randomized to TAFINLAR administered with trametinib compared to those randomized to placebo. Efficacy results are presented in Table 22 and Figure 4. Table 22.

Kaplan-Meier Curves for Relapse-Free Survival in COMBI-AD in the Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma 14.4 BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety and efficacy of TAFINLAR alone or administered with trametinib were evaluated in a multi-center, three-cohort, non-randomized, activity-estimating, open-label trial (Study BRF113928, NCT01336634). Key eligibility criteria were locally confirmed BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC, no prior exposure to BRAF or MEK-inhibitor, and absence of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement (unless patients had progression on prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy). Patients enrolled in Cohorts A and B were required to have received at least one previous platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for NSCLC with demonstrated disease progression but no more than three prior systemic regimens. Patients enrolled in Cohort C could not have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Patients in Cohort A received TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily. Patients in Cohorts B and C received TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and DoR. There were a total of 171 patients enrolled which included 78 patients enrolled in Cohort A, 57 patients enrolled in Cohort B, and 36 patients enrolled in Cohort C. The characteristics of the study population were: a median age of 66 years, 48% male; 81% White, 14% Asian, 3% Black, and 2% Hispanic; 60% former smokers, 32% never smokers, and 8% current smokers; 27% had ECOG performance status (PS) 0, 63% had ECOG PS 1, and 11% had ECOG PS of 2; 99% had metastatic disease of which 6% had brain metastasis at baseline and 14% had liver metastasis at baseline; 11% had systemic anti-cancer therapy in the adjuvant setting and 58% of the 135 previously treated patients had only one line of prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease; and 98% had non-squamous histology. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 23. Table 23.

Trial BRF117019 excluded patients who could not swallow or retain the medication; who received prior treatment with BRAF or MEK inhibitors; with symptomatic or untreated CNS metastases; or who had airway obstruction. Patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and DoR. Thirty-six patients were enrolled and were evaluable for response in the ATC cohort. The median age was 71 years (range: 47 to 85); 44% were male, 50% White, 44% Asian; and 94% had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Prior anti-cancer treatments included surgery and external beam radiotherapy (83% each), and systemic therapy (67%). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 24. Table 24.

In adult studies, patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR per RECIST v1.1, RANO [HGG] or modified RANO [LGG] criteria and duration of response (DoR). BRF117019 Study and NCI-MATCH Study Study BRF117019 (NCT02034110) [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] is a multi-cohort, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label trial in adult patients with selected tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation, including high grade glioma (HGG) (n = 45), biliary tract cancer (BTC) (n = 43), low grade glioma (LGG) (n = 13), adenocarcinoma of small intestine (ASI) (n = 3), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1), and anaplastic thyroid cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] . Patients were enrolled based on local assessments of BRAF V600E mutation status; a central laboratory confirmed the BRAF mutation in 93 of 105 patients. Arm H (EAY131-H) of the NCI-MATCH study (NCT02465060) is a single-arm, open-label study that enrolled patients with a BRAF V600E mutation. Patients with melanoma, thyroid cancer, or CRC were excluded. BRAF V600E mutation status for enrollment was determined either by central or local laboratory test. The study included adult patients with solid tumors including gastrointestinal tumors (n = 14), lung tumors (n = 7), gynecologic or peritoneal tumors (n = 6), CNS tumors (n = 4), and ameloblastoma of mandible (n = 1). Among the 131 patients enrolled in BRF117019 and NCI-MATCH with the tumor types shown in Table 21, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 51 years with 20% age 65 or older; 56% female; 85% White, 9% Asian, 3% Black, 3% Other; and 37% ECOG 0, 56% ECOG 1, and 6% ECOG 2. Of the 131 patients, 90% received prior systemic therapy. Efficacy results in patients with solid tumors are summarized in Table 25. Table 25.

Part C was a dose escalation of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib in patients with a BRAF V600E mutation. Part D was a cohort expansion phase of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib in patients with LGG with a BRAF V600E mutation. The major efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by independent review committee per RANO criteria. The efficacy of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib was evaluated in 48 pediatric patients, including 34 patients with LGG and 2 patients with HGG. For patients with BRAF V600E mutant LGG and HGG in Parts C and D, the median age was 10 years (range: 1 to 17); 50% were male, 75% White, 8% Asian, 3% Black; and 58% had Karnofsky/Lansky performance status of 100. Prior anti-cancer treatments included surgery (83%), external beam radiotherapy (2.8%), and systemic therapy (92%). The ORR was 25% (95% CI: 12%, 42%). For the 9 patients who responded, DoR was ≥ 6 months for 78% of patients and ≥ 24 months for 44% of patients. CDRB436G2201 (G2201) Study – High-Grade Glioma Cohort Study G2201 (NCT02684058) was a multi-center, randomized, open-label, Phase II study of dabrafenib and trametinib in chemotherapy naïve pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutant low-grade glioma (LGG) and patients with relapsed or progressive BRAF V600E mutant HGG. Patients with HGG were enrolled in a single-arm cohort. The major efficacy outcome measure for the HGG cohort was ORR as assessed by independent review committee per RANO 2010 criteria. The efficacy of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib was evaluated in 41 pediatric patients with relapsed or progressive HGG. For patients with BRAF V600E mutant HGG enrolled in the HGG cohort, the median age was 13 years (range: 2 to 17); 56% were female, 61% White, 27% Asian, 2.4% Black and 37% had Karnofsky/Lansky performance status of 100. Prior anti-cancer treatments included surgery (98%), radiotherapy (90%), and chemotherapy (81%). The ORR was 56% (95% CI: 40, 72). The median DoR was not reached (95% CI: 9.2, NE). For the 23 patients who responded in the HGG cohort, DoR was ≥ 6 months for 78% of patients, ≥ 12 months for 48% of patients, and ≥ 24 months for 22% of patients. 14.7 BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Low-Grade Glioma CDRB436G2201 (G2201) Study – Low-Grade Glioma Cohort The safety and efficacy of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive low-grade glioma (LGG) in pediatric patients aged 1 to < 18 years of age were evaluated in the multi-center, open-label trial (Study CDRB436G2201; NCT02684058). Patients with LGG (WHO grades 1 and 2) who required first systemic therapy were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to dabrafenib plus trametinib (D + T) or carboplatin plus vincristine (C + V). BRAF mutation status was identified prospectively via a local assessment or a central laboratory test. In addition, retrospective testing of available tumor samples by the central laboratory was performed to evaluate BRAF V600E mutation status. Patients received age- and weight-based dosing of TAFINLAR and trametinib until loss of clinical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity. Carboplatin and vincristine were dosed based on body surface area at doses 175 mg/m 2 and 1.5 mg/m 2 (0.05 mg/kg for patients < 12 kg), respectively, as one 10-week induction course followed by eight 6-week cycles of maintenance therapy. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) by independent review based on RANO LGG (2017) criteria. Additional efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival and overall survival. The primary analysis was performed when all patients had completed at least 32 weeks of therapy. In the LGG cohort, 110 patients were randomized to D + T (n = 73) or C + V (n = 37). Median age was 9.5 years (range: 1 to 17); 60% were female. Study G2201 showed a statistically significant improvement in ORR and PFS in LGG patients randomized to D + T compared to those randomized to C + V. Efficacy results are shown in Table 26. Table 26.

Draw up all of the TAFINLAR oral suspension from the dosing cup into a syringe by pulling back on the plunger. Be sure to use a syringe that can be used with the feeding tube or to give the TAFINLAR oral suspension by mouth. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure what syringe to use. Step 3. If giving the dose through a feeding tube, give the TAFINLAR oral suspension into the feeding tube according to the feeding tube manufacturer’s instructions. If giving a dose of TAFINLAR oral suspension using an oral syringe, place the open end of the oral syringe inside the mouth with the tip pointing toward the inside of either cheek. If you are giving a dose of the TAFINLAR oral suspension to a child, make sure they are sitting upright. Slowly push the plunger all the way down on the plunger to give the full dose. Warning: Giving TAFINLAR oral suspension directly into the throat or pushing down on the plunger too fast may cause choking. Step 4. Add about 5 mL of water to the empty dosing cup. Step 5. Stir to loosen the medicine residue inside the cup. Step 6. Draw up the water and medicine residue mixture. Step 7. Give the water and medicine residue mixture through the solution into the feeding tube or into the inside of the cheek. It is important to give all of the medicine that is left in the syringe and feeding tube (residue). Repeat Step 4 through Step 7 three times to make sure that you give a full dose of TAFINLAR. Step 8. After repeating Step 4 through Step 7 three times, flush the feeding tube with drinking water. Then go to the cleaning steps in Section C. Section C. Cleaning the dosing cup and syringe (if used). Use only clean water to rinse the dosing cup. Do not use soap or dishwashing liquid when cleaning the dosing cup. Step 1. Rinse the dosing cup under clean cool water right away after dosing. Shake off excess water then wipe dry using clean paper towels. Note: Keep the dosing cup away from other kitchen items. Step 2. Rinse the teaspoon in clean cold water then wash in warm soapy water and dry using clean paper towels. You can also wash the teaspoon in a dishwasher. Step 3. Clean the oral syringe or the other syringe, as instructed by your healthcare provider, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Section D. How to throw away (dispose of) TAFINLAR tablets that are expired or no longer needed, or old dosing cups. Throw away (dispose of) unused tablets or suspension, or old dosing cups into the trash. Do not pour suspension down the drain. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist about how to safely throw away (dispose of) TAFINLAR if you are not sure. Section E. How to clean up any spilled TAFINLAR oral suspension. If you accidentally spill any TAFINLAR oral suspension, clean up the spill as follows: 1. Put on plastic gloves. 2. Soak up the spilled TAFINLAR oral suspension completely using an absorbent material, such as paper towels soaked with either a mixture of water and household disinfectant or with ethanol 70% (or higher grade). 3. Repeat the cleaning with fresh soaked absorbent material at least three times until the area is clean. 4. Dry the area with paper towels. 5. Throw away all the disposable materials used to clean the spillage into a sealable plastic bag. 6. Dispose of the bags into the trash. 7. Wash your hands well with soap and water. How should I store TAFINLAR tablets for oral suspension? Store the TAFINLAR tablets bottle with the two plastic canisters inside and the cap tightly closed. The canisters help keep the medicine dry and protect it from moisture. Store the bottle and dosing cups in the original packaging to protect from light and moisture. Store at 68°F to 77°F (20°C to 25°C). Keep TAFINLAR tablets and all medicines out of the reach of children.
