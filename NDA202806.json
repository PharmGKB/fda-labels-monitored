        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New Primary Malignancies, Cutaneous, and Non-cutaneous can occur when TAFINLAR is administered as a single agent or with trametinib. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to, or while on therapy, and following discontinuation of treatment. ( 5.1 , 2.4 ) Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-type Tumors: Increased cell proliferation can occur with BRAF inhibitors. ( 5.2 , 2.1 ) Hemorrhage : Major hemorrhagic events can occur in patients receiving TAFINLAR with trametinib. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. ( 5.3 ) Cardiomyopathy : Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before treatment with TAFINLAR and trametinib, after one month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter. ( 5.4 , 2.4 ) Uveitis : Perform ophthalmologic evaluation for any visual disturbances. ( 5.5 , 2.4 ) Serious Febrile Reactions : Incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with TAFINLAR and trametinib. ( 5.6 , 2.4 ) Serious Skin Toxicities : Monitor for skin toxicities. Discontinue for intolerable Grade 2 or for Grade 3 or 4 rash not improving within 3 weeks despite interruption of TAFINLAR. Permanently discontinue for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). ( 5.7 , 2.4 ) Hyperglycemia : Monitor serum glucose levels in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. ( 5.8 ) Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency (G6PD): Closely monitor for hemolytic anemia. ( 5.9 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception. ( 5.11 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 New Primary Malignancies Cutaneous Malignancies Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR monotherapy, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCC), and keratoacanthomas occurred in 11% and 4% of patients, respectively. Basal cell carcinoma and new primary melanoma occurred in 4% and 1% of patients, respectively. Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, the incidence of cuSCC (including keratoacanthomas) occurred in 2% of patients. Basal cell carcinoma and new primary melanoma occurred in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of TAFINLAR, every 2 months while on therapy, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of TAFINLAR. Non-Cutaneous Malignancies Based on its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR may promote the growth and development of malignancies with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR monotherapy and TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, non-cutaneous malignancies occurred in 1% of patients. Monitor patients receiving TAFINLAR for signs or symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells which are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation status prior to initiation of TAFINLAR as a single agent or in combination with trametinib [see Indications and Usage (1.6), Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . 5.3 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage, including major hemorrhage defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur when TAFINLAR is administered with trametinib. Fatal cases have been reported. Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, hemorrhagic events occurred in 17% of patients. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib. Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 0.6% of patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib. Fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.5% of patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib. The fatal events were cerebral hemorrhage and brainstem hemorrhage. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any Grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold TAFINLAR for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved, resume at the next lower dose level. 5.4 Cardiomyopathy Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 10% from baseline and below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN), occurred in 6% of patients. Development of cardiomyopathy resulted in dose interruption or discontinuation of TAFINLAR in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 45 of 50 patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib. Assess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of TAFINLAR with trametinib, one month after initiation of TAFINLAR, and then at 2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment. Withhold TAFINLAR for symptomatic cardiomyopathy or asymptomatic LV dysfunction of > 20% from baseline that is below institutional LLN. Resume TAFINLAR at the same dose level upon recovery of cardiac function to at least the institutional LLN for LVEF and absolute decrease ≤ 10% compared to baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.5 Uveitis Across clinical trials, uveitis occurred in 1% of patients who received TAFINLAR monotherapy and in 2% of patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib. Treatment employed in clinical trials included steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops. Monitor patients for visual signs and symptoms of uveitis (e.g., change in vision, photophobia, eye pain). If iritis is diagnosed, administer ocular therapy and continue TAFINLAR without dose modification. If severe uveitis (i.e., iridocyclitis) or if mild or moderate uveitis does not respond to ocular therapy, withhold TAFINLAR and treat as clinically indicated. Resume TAFINLAR at the same or lower dose if improves to Grade 0 or 1. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for persistent Grade 2 or greater uveitis of > 6 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.6 Serious Febrile Reactions Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur with TAFINLAR. The incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased when TAFINLAR is administered with trametinib compared with TAFINLAR as a single agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR monotherapy, fever (serious and non-serious) occurred in 30% of patients. Approximately 13% of these patients experienced 3 or more discrete episodes. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills occurred in 6% of patients. Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration or renal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%, dehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in < 1% of patients. Withhold TAFINLAR when used as monotherapy, and both TAFINLAR and trametinib when used in combination, if the patient’s temperature is ≥ 100.4°F. In case of recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection, and monitor serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe pyrexia. If appropriate, TAFINLAR, or both TAFINLAR and trametinib when used in combination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for at least 24 hours, either at the same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Administer antipyretics as secondary prophylaxis when resuming TAFINLAR if patient had a prior episode of severe febrile reaction or fever associated with complications. Administer corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 10 mg daily) for at least 5 days for second or subsequent pyrexia if temperature does not return to baseline within 3 days of onset of pyrexia, or for pyrexia associated with complications, such as dehydration, hypotension, renal failure or severe chills/rigors, and there is no evidence of active infection. 5.7 Serious Skin Toxicities Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with TAFINLAR administered with trametinib [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, other serious skin toxicity occurred in < 1% of patients. Monitor for new or worsening serious skin reactions. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for SCARs. For other skin toxicities, withhold TAFINLAR for intolerable or severe skin toxicity. Resume TAFINLAR at a lower dose in patients with improvement or recovery from skin toxicity within 3 weeks. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR if skin toxicity has not improved within 3 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.8 Hyperglycemia Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR monotherapy, 14% of patients with a history of diabetes that received TAFINLAR required more intensive hypoglycemic therapy. Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia occurred in 3% of patients. Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, 15% of patients with a history of diabetes who had received TAFINLAR with trametinib required more intensive hypoglycemic therapy. Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia occurred in 2% of patients. Monitor serum glucose levels upon initiation and as clinically appropriate when TAFINLAR is administered in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated. 5.9 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency TAFINLAR, which contains a sulfonamide moiety, confers a potential risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Monitor patients with G6PD deficiency for signs of hemolytic anemia while taking TAFINLAR. 5.10 Risks Associated With Combination Treatment TAFINLAR is indicated for use in combination with trametinib. Review the Prescribing Information for trametinib for information on the serious risks of trametinib prior to initiation of TAFINLAR with trametinib. 5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Dabrafenib was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception, since TAFINLAR can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks after the last dose [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] ."

The pooled safety populations described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to TAFINLAR as a single agent in 586 patients with various solid tumors, including BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, enrolled in BREAK-2, BREAK-3, BREAK-MB, BRF113220, and BRF112680 and that to TAFINLAR administered with trametinib in 1087 patients enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, MEK111504, COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma or NSCLC. Among these 586 patients who received TAFINLAR as a single agent, 46% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 15% were exposed for greater than one year. Among the 1087 patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Metastatic or Unresectable BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma TAFINLAR as a Single Agent The safety of TAFINLAR was evaluated in BREAK-3, a multicenter, international, open-label, randomized (3:1), controlled trial allocated 250 patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily (n = 187) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 63) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . The trial excluded patients with abnormal LVEF or cardiac valve morphology (≥ Grade 2), corrected QT interval ≥ 480 milliseconds on electrocardiogram, or a known history of G6PD deficiency. The median duration on treatment was 4.9 months for patients treated with TAFINLAR and 2.8 months for dacarbazine-treated patients. The population exposed to TAFINLAR was 60% male, 99% white, and had a median age of 53 years. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients treated with TAFINLAR were, in order of decreasing frequency: hyperkeratosis, headache, pyrexia, arthralgia, papilloma, alopecia, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES). The incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication in the BREAK-3 study was 3% for patients treated with TAFINLAR and 3% for patients treated with dacarbazine. The most frequent (≥ 2%) adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of TAFINLAR were pyrexia (9%), PPES (3%), chills (3%), fatigue (2%), and headache (2%).

In the COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies, patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Both trials excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED), QTcB interval ≥ 480 msec, treatment refractory hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, or a known history of G6PD deficiency [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Among these 559 patients, 199 (36%) were exposed to TAFINLAR for > 6 months to 12 months while 185 (33%) were exposed to TAFINLAR for ≥ 1 year. The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91), 57% were male, 98% were white, 72% had baseline ECOG performance status 0 and 28% had ECOG performance status 1, 64% had M1c stage disease, 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline and 0.5% had a history of brain metastases. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) for TAFINLAR in patients who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib in the COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies were: pyrexia, rash, chills, headache, arthralgia, and cough. The demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in the COMBI-d study are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Patients who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib had a median duration of exposure of 11 months (range: 3 days to 30 months) to TAFINLAR. Among the 209 patients who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib, 26% were exposed to TAFINLAR for > 6 months to 12 months while 46% were exposed to TAFINLAR for > 1 year. In the COMBI-d study, adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of TAFINLAR occurred in 11% of patients who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib; the most frequent was pyrexia (1.9%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of TAFINLAR occurred in 26% of patients who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib; the most frequent were pyrexia (14%), neutropenia (1.9%), rash (1.9%), and chills (1.9%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of TAFINLAR occurred in 56% of patients who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib; the most frequent were pyrexia (35%), chills (11%), vomiting (7%), nausea (5%), and decreased ejection fraction (5%).

The pyrexia management algorithm interrupted both dabrafenib and trametinib when patient’s temperature is ≥ 100.4°F. Grade 3-4 pyrexia occurred in 4.3% of patients, hospitalizations due to pyrexia occurred in 5.1% of patients, pyrexia with complications (dehydration, hypotension, renal dysfunction, syncope, severe chills) occurred in 2.2% of patients, and treatment discontinuation due to pyrexia occurred in 2.5% of patients. Metastatic, BRAF V600E-Mutation Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of TAFINLAR when administered with trametinib was evaluated in 93 patients with previously untreated (n = 36) and previously treated (n = 57) metastatic BRAF V600E mutation-positive NSCLC in a multicenter, multi-cohort, non-randomized, open-label trial (Study BRF113928). Patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), QTc interval ≥ 480 msec, treatment refractory hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis, or history or current RVO [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Among these 93 patients, 53 (57%) were exposed to TAFINLAR and trametinib for > 6 months and 27 (29%) were exposed to TAFINLAR and trametinib for ≥ 1 year. The median age was 65 years (range: 41 to 91); 46% were male; 85% were white; 32% had baseline ECOG performance status 0 and 61% had ECOG performance status 1; 98% had non-squamous histology; and 12% were current smokers, 60% were former smokers, and 28% had never smoked. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in these 93 patients were: pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dry skin, decreased appetite, edema, rash, chills, hemorrhage, cough, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of TAFINLAR occurred in 18% of patients; the most frequent were pyrexia (2.2%), decreased ejection fraction (2.2%), and respiratory distress (2.2%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of TAFINLAR occurred in 35% of patients; the most frequent were pyrexia (10%), diarrhea (4.3%), nausea (4.3%), vomiting (4.3%), and neutropenia (3.2%).

A total of 206 patients were enrolled in the trial, 36 of whom were enrolled in the ATC cohort, 105 were enrolled in specific solid tumor cohorts, and 65 in other malignancies [see Clinical Studies (14.5, 14.6)] . Patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among these 206 patients, 103 (50%) were exposed to TAFINLAR for ≥ 1 year and 101 (49%) were exposed to trametinib for ≥ 1 year. The median age was 60 years (range: 18 to 89); 56% were male; 79% were white; and 34% had baseline ECOG performance status 0 and 60% had ECOG performance status 1. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients who received TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. Serious adverse reactions in > 5% of patients included pyrexia (11%) and pneumonia (6%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.9% of patients who received TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in > 1% of patients included sepsis (1.9%).

The median duration of exposure to TAFINLAR in Parts C (dose escalation) and D (cohort expansion) was 20.8 and 24.9 months, respectively. The median duration of exposure to trametinib in Parts C and D was 20.8 and 24.4 months, respectively. The median age of pediatric patients who received TAFINLAR with trametinib was 9 years (range: 1 – 17 years). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% of patients who received TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. Serious adverse reactions in > 5% of patients included pyrexia (25%) and ejection fraction decreased (6%). Permanent treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 21% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation in > 3% of patients included ALT increased (6%), AST increased (4.2%) and ejection fraction decreased (4.2%). Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 73% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in > 5% of patients included pyrexia (56%), vomiting (19%), neutropenia (13%), rash (13%), ejection fraction decreased (6%) and uveitis (6%). Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 25% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in > 5% of patients included pyrexia (13%).

( 7.1 ) Concomitant use with agents that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6 may result in loss of efficacy of these agents. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on TAFINLAR Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 may increase the concentration of dabrafenib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Substitution of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 is recommended during treatment with TAFINLAR. If concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 is unavoidable, monitor patients closely for adverse reactions when taking strong inhibitors. 7.2 Effects of TAFINLAR on Other Drugs Dabrafenib decreased the systemic exposures of midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate), S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate), and R-warfarin (a CYP3A4/CYP1A2 substrate) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) levels more frequently in patients receiving warfarin during initiation or discontinuation of dabrafenib. Coadministration of TAFINLAR with other substrates of these enzymes, including dexamethasone or hormonal contraceptives , can result in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8. 3 )] . Substitute for these medications or monitor patients for loss of efficacy if use of these medications is unavoidable."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Do not breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: May impair fertility. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] , TAFINLAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There is insufficient data in pregnant women exposed to TAFINLAR to assess the risks. Dabrafenib was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 150 mg twice daily (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a combined female fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats conducted during the period of organogenesis, developmental toxicity consisted of embryo-lethality, ventricular septal defects, and variation in thymic shape at a dabrafenib dose of 300 mg/kg/day [approximately three times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on area under the curve (AUC)]. At doses of 20 mg/kg/day or greater (equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC), rats demonstrated delays in skeletal development and reduced fetal body weight. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of dabrafenib in human milk, or the effects of dabrafenib on the breastfed infant, or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks following the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TAFINLAR. Contraception Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 )]. Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TAFINLAR and for 2 weeks after the last dose. Counsel patients to use a non-hormonal method of contraception since TAFINLAR can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Males To avoid potential drug exposure to pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive potential, advise male patients (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with TAFINLAR and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential that TAFINLAR may impair fertility. A reduction in fertility was observed in female rats at dose exposures equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended dose. A reduction in the number of corpora lutea was noted in pregnant rats at dose exposures approximately three times the human exposure at the recommended dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Males Advise male patients of the potential risk for impaired spermatogenesis which may be irreversible. Effects on spermatogenesis have been observed in animals treated with dabrafenib at dose exposures up to three times the human exposure at the recommended dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors The safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older that weigh at least 26 kg was established based on data in adults and data from a pediatric study X2101. In study X2101, Parts C and D enrolled a total of 48 patients (ages 1 to 17) with the following tumor types: LGG (n = 34), HGG (n = 2), LCH (n = 11), and juvenile xanthogranulomatosis (n = 1) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.6)] . The safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib in pediatric patients younger than 6 years old have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of TAFINLAR as a single agent in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a repeat-dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, an increased incidence of kidney cysts and tubular deposits were noted at doses as low as 0.2 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC. Additionally, forestomach hyperplasia, decreased bone length, and early vaginal opening were noted at doses as low as 0.8 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 586 patients with various solid tumors who received single agent TAFINLAR, 22% were aged 65 years and older. Of the 187 patients with melanoma who received single-agent TAFINLAR in the BREAK-3 study, 21% were aged 65 years or older [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . No overall differences in the effectiveness or safety of TAFINLAR were observed between geriatric patients as compared to younger adults in the BREAK-3 study. Of the 994 patients with melanoma who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib in the COMBI-d, COMBI-v, and COMBI-AD studies [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)] , 21% were aged 65 years and older and 5% were aged 75 years and older.

As hepatic metabolism and biliary secretion are the primary routes of elimination of dabrafenib and its metabolites, patients with moderate (bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) to severe (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment may have increased exposure. An appropriate dose has not been established for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Dabrafenib is an inhibitor of some mutated forms of BRAF kinases with in vitro IC 50 values of 0.65, 0.5, and 1.84 nM for BRAF V600E, BRAF V600K, and BRAF V600D enzymes, respectively. Dabrafenib also inhibits wild-type BRAF and CRAF kinases with IC 50 values of 3.2 and 5.0 nM, respectively, and other kinases, such as SIK1, NEK11, and LIMK1 at higher concentrations. Some mutations in the BRAF gene, including those that result in BRAF V600E, can result in constitutively activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth [see Indications and Usage (1)] . Dabrafenib inhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo . Dabrafenib and trametinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Use of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination resulted in greater growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation positive tumor xenografts compared with either drug alone. In the setting of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway re-activation has been identified as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors [see Indications and Usage (1.7)]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The potential effect of TAFINLAR on QT interval was assessed in a dedicated multiple-dose study in 32 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors. No large changes in the mean QT interval (i.e., > 20 ms) were detected with dabrafenib 300 mg administered twice daily (two times the recommended dosage). In clinical trials, QTc (heart rate-corrected QT) prolongation to ≥ 500 ms occurred in 0.8% (2/264) of patients who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib and in 1.5% (4/264) of patients who received TAFINLAR as a single agent. The QTc was increased > 60 ms from baseline in 3.8% (10/264) of patients who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib and 3% (8/264) of patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, median time to achieve peak plasma concentration (T max ) is 2 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability of oral dabrafenib is 95%. Following a single dose, dabrafenib exposure (C max and AUC) increased in a dose-proportional manner across the dose range of 12 mg to 300 mg, but the increase was less than dose-proportional after repeat twice-daily dosing. After repeat twice-daily dosing of 150 mg, the mean accumulation ratio was 0.73, and the inter-subject variability (CV%) of AUC at steady-state was 38%. Effect of Food Administration of dabrafenib with a high-fat meal (approximately 1000 calories, 58-75 grams fat, 58 grams carbohydrates, and 33 grams protein) decreased C max by 51%, decreased AUC by 31%, and delayed median T max by 3.6 hours as compared with the fasted state. Distribution Dabrafenib is 99.7% bound to human plasma proteins. The apparent volume of distribution (V c /F) is 70.3 L. Elimination The mean terminal half-life of dabrafenib is 8 hours after oral administration. Hydroxy-dabrafenib terminal half-life (10 hours) parallels that of dabrafenib while the carboxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib metabolites exhibit longer half-lives (21 to 22 hours). The apparent clearance of dabrafenib is 17.0 L/h after single dosing and 34.4 L/h after 2 weeks of twice-daily dosing. Metabolism The metabolism of dabrafenib is primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 to form hydroxy-dabrafenib. Hydroxy-dabrafenib is further oxidized via CYP3A4 to form carboxy-dabrafenib and subsequently excreted in bile and urine. Carboxy-dabrafenib is decarboxylated to form desmethyl-dabrafenib; desmethyl-dabrafenib may be reabsorbed from the gut. Desmethyl-dabrafenib is further metabolized by CYP3A4 to oxidative metabolites. Mean metabolite-to-parent AUC ratios following repeat-dose administration are 0.9, 11, and 0.7 for hydroxy-, carboxy-, and desmethyl-dabrafenib, respectively. Based on systemic exposure, relative potency, and pharmacokinetic properties, both hydroxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib are likely to contribute to the clinical activity of dabrafenib. Excretion Fecal excretion is the major route of elimination accounting for 71% of radioactive dose while urinary excretion accounted for 23% of total radioactivity as metabolites only. Specific Populations Age has no effect on dabrafenib pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetic differences based on sex, weight and renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) are not clinically relevant. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib were evaluated in 109 pediatric patients after single or repeat weight-adjusted dosing. The pharmacokinetic exposures of dabrafenib at the recommended weight-adjusted dosage in pediatric patients were within range of those observed in adults. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib was evaluated using a population analysis in 65 patients with mild (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1x to 1.5x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment enrolled in clinical trials. Mild hepatic impairment has no effect on systemic exposure to dabrafenib and its metabolites. No data are available in patients with moderate (bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) to severe (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Trametinib on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of trametinib 2 mg daily with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily resulted in a 23% increase in AUC of dabrafenib, a 33% increase in AUC of desmethyl-dabrafenib, and no change in AUC of hydroxy-dabrafenib as compared with administration of dabrafenib. Effect of Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of dabrafenib 75 mg twice daily and ketoconazole 400 mg once daily (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) for 4 days increased dabrafenib AUC by 71%, hydroxy-dabrafenib AUC by 82%, and desmethyl-dabrafenib AUC by 68%. Coadministration of dabrafenib 75 mg twice daily and gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) for 4 days increased dabrafenib AUC by 47%, with no change in the AUC of dabrafenib metabolites. Effect of Strong Inducers of CYP3A4 or Moderate Inducers CYP2C8 on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and rifampin 600 mg once daily (a strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C8 inducer) for 10 days decreased dabrafenib AUC by 34%, had no effect on hydroxy-dabrafenib AUC, and decreased desmethyl-dabrafenib AUC by 30%. Effect of Acid Reducing Agents on Dabrafenib: Coadministration of dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and rabeprazole 40 mg once daily for 4 days resulted in a 3% increase in AUC of dabrafenib, a 15% decrease in AUC of desmethyl-dabrafenib, and a 5% increase in AUC of hydroxy-dabrafenib as compared to administration of dabrafenib alone. The changes in exposure of dabrafenib and its metabolites were not clinically relevant. Effect of Dabrafenib on CYP Substrates: In vitro data demonstrate that dabrafenib is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 via activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) nuclear receptors. Dabrafenib may also induce CYP2C enzymes via the same mechanism. Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily for 15 days and a single dose of midazolam 3 mg (a CYP3A4 substrate) decreased midazolam AUC by 65%. Coadministration of dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily for 15 days and a single dose of warfarin 15 mg decreased the AUC of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) by 37% and the AUC of R-warfarin (CYP3A4/CYP1A2 substrate) by 33%. Effect of Transporters on Dabrafenib: Dabrafenib and its metabolites, hydroxyl-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib, are substrates of human P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) but are not substrates of organic cation transporter (OCT1) or organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1A2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1) in vitro . Effect of Dabrafenib on Transporters: Dabrafenib and its metabolites, hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib, and desmethyl-dabrafenib, are inhibitors of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and organic anion transporter (OAT1 and OAT3) in vitro . Dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib are inhibitors of OCT2 and BCRP in vitro . Coadministration of TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily with a single dose of rosuvastatin (a sensitive OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate) increased rosuvastatin C max by 2.6-fold, but did not change its AUC."

Patients were randomized to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily (n = 187) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 63). Randomization was stratified by disease stage at baseline [unresectable Stage III (regional nodal or in-transit metastases), M1a (distant skin, subcutaneous, or nodal metastases), or M1b (lung metastases) versus M1c melanoma (all other visceral metastases or elevated serum LDH)]. The main efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator. In addition, an independent radiology review committee (IRRC) assessed the following efficacy outcome measures in pre-specified supportive analyses: PFS, confirmed overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DoR). The median age of patients in the BREAK-3 study was 52 years. The majority of the trial population was male (60%), white (99%), had an ECOG performance status of 0 (67%), M1c disease (66%), and normal LDH (62%). All patients had tumor tissue with mutations in BRAF V600E as determined by a clinical trial assay at a centralized testing site. Tumor samples from 243 patients (97%) were tested retrospectively, using an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test, THxID™-BRAF assay. The median durations of follow-up prior to initiation of alternative treatment in patients randomized to receive TAFINLAR was 5.1 months and in the dacarbazine arm was 3.5 months. Twenty-eight (44%) patients crossed over from the dacarbazine arm at the time of disease progression to receive TAFINLAR. The BREAK-3 study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival in the patients treated with TAFINLAR. Table 17 and Figure 1 summarize the PFS results. Table 17.

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Investigator-Assessed Progression-Free Survival in the BREAK-3 Study In supportive analyses based on IRRC assessment and in an exploratory subgroup analysis of patients with retrospectively confirmed V600E mutation-positive melanoma with the THxID™-BRAF assay, the PFS results were consistent with those of the primary efficacy analysis. BREAK-MB Study The activity of TAFINLAR for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma, metastatic to the brain was evaluated in a single-arm, open-label, two-cohort multicenter trial (the BREAK-MB study; NCT01266967). All patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily. Patients in Cohort A (n = 74) had received no prior local therapy for brain metastases, while patients in Cohort B (n = 65) had received at least one local therapy for brain metastases, including, but not limited to, surgical resection, whole brain radiotherapy, or stereotactic radiosurgery, such as gamma knife, linear-accelerated-based radiosurgery, or charged particles. In addition, patients in Cohort B were required to have evidence of disease progression in a previously treated lesion or an untreated lesion. Additional eligibility criteria were at least one measurable lesion of 0.5 cm or greater in largest diameter on contrast-enhanced MRI, stable or decreasing corticosteroid dose, and no more than two prior systemic regimens for treatment of metastatic disease. The major efficacy outcome measure was estimation of the overall intracranial response rate (OIRR) in each cohort. The median age of patients in Cohort A was 50 years, 72% were male, 100% were white, 59% had a pre-treatment ECOG performance status of 0, and 57% had an elevated LDH value at baseline. The median age of patients in Cohort B was 51 years, 63% were male, 98% were white, 66% had a pre-treatment ECOG performance status of 0, and 54% had an elevated LDH value at baseline. The intracranial response rate as determined by an independent radiology review committee, masked to investigator response assessments, was 18% (95% CI: 10%, 28%) in Cohort A and 18% (95% CI: 10%, 30%) in Cohort B. The median duration of intracranial response was 4.6 months in both cohorts. 14.2 BRAF V600E or V600K Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma – TAFINLAR With Trametinib COMBI-d Study and COMBI-v Study The safety and efficacy of TAFINLAR administered with trametinib were evaluated in two international, randomized, active-controlled trials: one double-blind trial (the COMBI-d study; NCT01584648) and one open-label trial (the COMBI-v study; NCT01597908). The COMBI-d study compared TAFINLAR and trametinib to TAFINLAR and placebo as first-line therapy for patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily or TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily plus matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by LDH level (> ULN vs. ≤ ULN) and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs. V600K). The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 with additional efficacy outcome measures of overall survival (OS) and confirmed overall response rate (ORR). The COMBI-v study compared TAFINLAR and trametinib to vemurafenib as first-line treatment therapy for patients with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Randomization was stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> ULN vs. ≤ ULN) and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs. V600K). The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS and ORR as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1. In the COMBI-d study, 423 patients were randomized to TAFINLAR plus trametinib (n = 211) or TAFINLAR plus placebo (n = 212). The median age was 56 years (range: 22 to 89 years), 53% were male, > 99% were white, 72% had ECOG performance status of 0, 4% had Stage IIIC, 66% had M1c disease, 65% had a normal LDH, and 2 patients had a history of brain metastases. All patients had tumor containing BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as determined by centralized testing, 85% with BRAF V600E mutations and 15% with BRAF V600K mutations. In the COMBI-v study, 704 patients were randomized to TAFINLAR plus trametinib (n = 352) or single-agent vemurafenib (n = 352). The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91 years), 96% were white, and 55% were male, 6% percent of patients had Stage IIIC, 61% had M1c disease, 67% had a normal LDH, 70% had ECOG performance status of 0, 89% had BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma, and one patient had a history of brain metastases. The COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS. Table 18 and Figures 2 and 3 summarize the efficacy results. Table 18.

Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in the COMBI-d Study Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in the COMBI-v Study COMBI-MB Study The activity of TAFINLAR with trametinib for the treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma, metastatic to the brain, was evaluated in a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort trial (the COMBI-MB study; NCT02039947). Eligible patients were required to have at least one measurable intracranial lesion and to have no leptomeningeal disease, parenchymal brain metastasis greater than 4 cm in diameter, ocular melanoma, or primary mucosal melanoma. Patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was intracranial response rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed intracranial response per RECIST v1.1, modified to allow up to five intracranial target lesions at least 5 mm in diameter, as assessed by independent review. The COMBI-MB study enrolled 121 patients with a BRAF V600E (85%) or V600K (15%) mutation. The median age was 54 years (range: 23 to 84 years), 58% were male, 100% were white, 8% were from the United States, 65% had a normal LDH value at baseline, and 97% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Intracranial metastases were asymptomatic in 87% and symptomatic in 13% of patients, 22% received prior local therapy for brain metastases, and 87% also had extracranial metastases. The intracranial response rate was 50% (95% CI: 41, 60), with a complete response rate of 4.1% and a partial response rate of 46%. The median duration of intracranial response was 6.4 months (range: 1 to 31 months). Of the patients with an intracranial response, 9% had stable or progressive disease as their best overall response. 14.3 Adjuvant Treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma COMBI-AD (NCT 01682083) was an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled patients with Stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as detected by the THxID ™ -BRAF assay and pathologic involvement of regional lymph node(s). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily or two placebos for up to 1 year. Enrollment required complete resection of melanoma with complete lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to randomization. The trial excluded patients with mucosal or ocular melanoma, unresectable in-transit metastases, distant metastatic disease, or prior systemic anticancer treatment, including radiotherapy. Randomization was stratified by BRAF mutation status (V600E or V600K) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC; 7 th Edition) stage (IIIa, IIIb, or IIIc). The major efficacy outcome measure was relapse-free survival (RFS), defined as the time from randomization to disease recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first as assessed by the investigator. Patients underwent imaging for tumor recurrence every 3 months for the first two years and every 6 months thereafter. In COMBI-AD, a total of 870 patients were randomized: 438 to TAFINLAR administered with trametinib and 432 to placebo. Median age was 51 years (range 18-89), 55% were male, 99% were white, and 91% had an ECOG performance status of 0. Disease characteristics were AJCC Stage IIIa (18%), Stage IIIb (41%), Stage IIIc (40%), stage unknown (1%); BRAF V600E mutation (91%), BRAF V600K mutation (9%); macroscopic lymph nodes (65%); and tumor ulceration (41%). The median duration of follow-up (time from randomization to last contact or death) was 2.8 years. COMBI-AD showed a statistically significant improvement in RFS in patients randomized to TAFINLAR administered with trametinib compared to those randomized to placebo. Efficacy results are presented in Table 19 and Figure 4. Table 19.

Kaplan-Meier Curves for Relapse-Free Survival in COMBI-AD in the Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma 14.4 BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety and efficacy of TAFINLAR alone or administered with trametinib were evaluated in a multi-center, three-cohort, non-randomized, activity-estimating, open-label trial (Study BRF113928, NCT01336634). Key eligibility criteria were locally confirmed BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC, no prior exposure to BRAF or MEK-inhibitor, and absence of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement (unless patients had progression on prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy). Patients enrolled in Cohorts A and B were required to have received at least one previous platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for NSCLC with demonstrated disease progression but no more than three prior systemic regimens. Patients enrolled in Cohort C could not have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. Patients in Cohort A received TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily. Patients in Cohorts B and C received TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and DoR. There were a total of 171 patients enrolled which included 78 patients enrolled in Cohort A, 57 patients enrolled in Cohort B, and 36 patients enrolled in Cohort C. The characteristics of the study population were a median age of 66 years, 48% male; 81% white, 14% Asian, 3% black, and 2% Hispanic; 60% were former smokers, 32% were never smokers, and 8% current smokers; 27% had ECOG performance status (PS) 0, 63% had ECOG PS 1, and 11% had ECOG PS of 2; 99% had metastatic disease of which 6% had brain metastasis at baseline and 14% had liver metastasis at baseline; 11% had systemic anti-cancer therapy in the adjuvant setting and 58% of the 135 previously treated patients had only one line of prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease; and 98% had non-squamous histology. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 19. Table 19.

Trial BRF117019 excluded patients who could not swallow or retain the medication; who received prior treatment with BRAF or MEK inhibitors; with symptomatic or untreated CNS metastases; or who had airway obstruction. Patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and DoR. Thirty-six patients were enrolled and were evaluable for response in the ATC cohort. The median age was 71 years (range: 47-85); 44% were male, 50% white, 44% Asian; and 94% had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Prior anti-cancer treatments included surgery and external beam radiotherapy (83% each), and systemic therapy (67%). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 20. Table 20.

In adult studies, patients received TAFINLAR 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR per RECIST v1.1, RANO [HGG] or modified RANO [LGG] criteria and duration of response (DoR). BRF117019 Study and NCI-MATCH Study Study BRF117019 (NCT02034110) [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] is a multi-cohort, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label trial in adult patients with selected tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation, including high grade glioma (HGG) (n = 45), biliary tract cancer (BTC) (n = 43), low grade glioma (LGG) (n = 13), adenocarcinoma of small intestine (ASI) (n = 3), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1), and anaplastic thyroid cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] . Patients were enrolled based on local assessments of BRAF V600E mutation status; a central laboratory confirmed the BRAF mutation in 93 of 105 patients. Arm H (EAY131-H) of the NCI-MATCH study (NCT02465060) is a single-arm, open-label study that enrolled patients with a BRAF V600E mutation. Patients with melanoma, thyroid cancer, or CRC were excluded. BRAF V600E mutation status for enrollment was determined either by central or local laboratory test. The study included adult patients with solid tumors including gastrointestinal tumors (n = 14), lung tumors (n = 7), gynecologic or peritoneal tumors (n = 6), CNS tumors (n = 4), and ameloblastoma of mandible (n = 1). Among the 131 patients enrolled in BRF117019 and NCI-MATCH with the tumor types shown in Table 21, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 51 years with 20% age 65 or older; 56% female; 85% White, 9% Asian, 3% Black, 3% Other; and 37% ECOG 0, 56% ECOG 1, and 6% ECOG 2. Of the 131 patients, 90% received prior systemic therapy. Efficacy results in patients with solid tumors are summarized in Table 21.

Part C was a dose escalation of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib in patients with a BRAF V600E mutation. Part D was a cohort expansion phase of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib in patients with LGG with a BRAF V600E mutation. The major efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by independent review committee per RANO criteria. The efficacy of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib was evaluated in 48 pediatric patients, including 34 patients with LGG and 2 patients with HGG. For patients with BRAF V600E mutant LGG and HGG in Parts C and D, the median age was 10 years (range: 1-17); 50% were male, 75% White, 8% Asian, 3% Black; and 58% had Karnofsky/Lansky performance status of 100. Prior anti-cancer treatments included surgery (83%), and external beam radiotherapy (2.8%), and systemic therapy (92%). The ORR was 25% (95% CI: 12%, 42%). For the 9 patients who responded, DoR was ≥6 months for 78% of patients and ≥24 months for 44% of patients."
