        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRI, SNRI, triptans), but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue PEXEVA and initiate supportive measures ( 5.2 ) Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity: Can cause fetal and neonatal harm. Increased risk of cardiovascular malformations for exposure during the first trimester. Exposure in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPNH) of the newborn ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulant drugs may increase risk. ( 5.5 ) Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen for bipolar disorder ( 5.6 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders ( 5.8 ) Angle-Closure Glaucoma: Angle-closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants ( 5 .9 ) Sexual Dysfunction: Peeva may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction (5.13) 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that include approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1. TABLE 2: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trails of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors per 1,000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 years old 14 additional patients 18-24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 years old 1 fewer patient ≥65 years old 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond 4 months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication of clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing PEXEVA, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts and behaviors. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome SSRIs, including PEXEVA, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The concomitant use of PEXEVA with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate PEXEVA in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking PEXEVA, discontinue PEXEVA before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)] . Monitor all patients taking PEXEVA for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with PEXEVA and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur and initiate symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of PEXEVA with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.3 Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation The CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine can elevate plasma levels of thioridazine and pimozide. Since thioridazine and pimozide given alone produce prolongation of the QTc interval and increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias, the use of PEXEVA is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine and pimozide [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.4 Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity PEXEVA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations. Exposure to paroxetine in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPNH) and/or neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. If PEXEVA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking PEXEVA, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . 5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including PEXEVA, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants, may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of PEXEVA and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio. 5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with PEXEVA or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients. Prior to initiating treatment with PEXEVA, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. 5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.X)] . Adverse reactions have been reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of PEXEVA in pediatric patients has not been established. [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . During clinical trials of paroxetine in GAD and another indication, incremental decreases in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals followed by 1 week at 20 mg/day was used before treatment was discontinued. The following adverse reactions were reported at an incidence of 2% or greater for paroxetine and were at least twice that reported for placebo: Abnormal dreams, paresthesia, and dizziness. 5.8 Seizures During clinical studies, seizure occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with PEXEVA. PEXEVA should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder. Discontinue PEXEVA in any patient who develops seizures. 5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including PEXEVA may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Cases of angle-closure glaucoma associated with use of paroxetine hydrochloride tables have been reported. Avoid use of antidepressants, including PEXEVA, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. 5.10 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including PEXEVA. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the results of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue PEXEVA and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with and SSRIs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . 5.11 Reduction of Efficacy of Tamoxifen Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced when co-prescribed with paroxetine as a result of paroxetine’s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 and lower blood levels of tamoxifen [see Drug interactions (7.1) . One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. It is uncertain whether the co-administration of paroxetine and tamoxifen has a significant adverse effect on the efficacy of tamoxifen. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. 5.12 Bone Fracture Epidemiological studies on bone fracture risk following exposure to some antidepressants, including SSRIs, have reported an association between antidepressant treatment and fractures. There are multiple possible causes for this observation, and it is unknown to what extent fracture risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment. 5.13 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SSRIs, including PEXEVA, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. . In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of PEXEVA and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment."

No new adverse reactions were observed in the paroxetine 60 mg dose group compared to any of the other treatment groups. In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and paroxetine 10, 20, and 40 mg in the treatment of PD, there was no clear relationship between adverse reactions and the dose of paroxetine to which patients were assigned, except for asthenia, dry mouth, anxiety, libido decreased, tremor, and abnormal ejaculation. In flexible-dose studies, no new adverse reactions were observed in patients receiving 60 mg of paroxetine compared to any of the other treatment groups. In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 20 and 40 mg of paroxetine in the treatment of GAD, for most of the adverse reactions, there was no clear relationship between adverse reactions and the dose of paroxetine to which patients were assigned, except for the following adverse reactions: asthenia, constipation, and abnormal ejaculation. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. The percentage of patients reporting symptoms of sexual dysfunction in males and females with MDD, OCD, PD, , GAD, and two other indications are displayed in Table 8. Table 8: Incidence of Sexual Adverse Reactions in Controlled Clinical Trials Paroxetine Placebo n (males) 1446 1042 % % Decreased Libido 6 to 15 0 to 5 Ejaculatory Disturbance 13 to 28 0 to 2 Impotence 2 to 9 0 to 3 n (females) 1822 1340 % % Decreased Libido 0 to 9 0 to 2 Orgasmic Disturbance 2 to 9 0 to 1 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with paroxetine treatment. Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome, patients recovered without sequelae. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, healthcare providers should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Hallucinations : In pooled clinical trials of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride, hallucinations were observed in 0.2% of paroxetine-treated patients compared to 0.1% of patients receiving placebo. 6.2 Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Paroxetine Less Common Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions occurred during the clinical studies of paroxetine and are not included elsewhere in the labeling.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein: Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of PEXEVA or other protein-bound drugs (e.g., warfarin) as warranted ( 7 ) Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Reduce dosage of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 as warranted. ( 7 ) Concomitant use with Tamoxifen: Consider use of an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. ( 5.11 , 7 ) 7.1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions Table 9: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with PEXEVA Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact The concomitant use of SSRIs, including PEXEVA, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin Intervention PEXEVA is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Dosage and Administration (2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Examples selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue Pimozide and Thioridizine Clinical Impact Increased plasma concentrations of pimozide and thioridazine, drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Intervention PEXEVA is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide or thioridazine [see Contraindications (4)]. Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with PEXEVA increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of PEXEVA and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Examples other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John’s Wort Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) Clinical Impact The concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with PEXEVA may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Intervention Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of PEXEVA and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Examples aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, warfarin Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein Clinical Impact PEXEVA is highly bound to plasma protein. The concomitant use of PEXEVA with another drug that is highly bound to plasma protein may increase free concentrations of PEXEVA or other tightly-bound drugs in plasma. Intervention Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of PEXEVA or other protein-bound drugs as warranted. Examples warfarin Drugs Metabolized by CYP25D6 Clinical Impact PEXEVA is a CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The concomitant use of PEXEVA with a CYP2D6 substrate may increase the exposure of the CYP2D6 substrate. Intervention Decrease the dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate if needed with concomitant PEXEVA use. Conversely, an increase in dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate may be needed if PEXEVA is discontinued. Examples propafenone, flecainide, atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, venlafaxine, risperidone. Tamoxifen Clinical Impact Concomitant use of tamoxifen with PEXEVA may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite (endoxifen) and reduced efficacy of tamoxifen Intervention Consider use of an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir Clinical Impact Co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Intervention Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability and efficacy)."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Can cause fetal and neonatal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus (5.4, 8.1) Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother (8.3) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy may have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. The findings from these studies are summarized below: A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascularmalformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and atrial septal defects (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery. A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8). Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with >9,000 birth defect cases and >4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants). Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) included a total of 20 distinct studies: 11 studies (including the above noted studies) reported estimates for both cardiovascular defects and overall congenital malformations, 3 studies reported estimates only for cardiovascular defects, and 6 studies reported estimates only for overall congenital malformations. While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence ofcardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations contributed to all cardiovascular malformations. If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of thepotential harm to the fetus. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Animal Findings: Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 8 (rat) and 2 (rabbit) times the MRHD of 60 mg on an mg/m2 basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of developmental effects. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day which is less than the MRHD on an mg/m2 basis. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these deaths is not known. Treatment of Pregnant Women During Their Third Trimester: Neonates exposed to PEXEVA® and other SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability,and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Infants exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 – 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use, including PEXEVA, in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association. Physicians should also note the results of a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depression, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period and were in remission. Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy showed a significant increase in relapse of their major depression compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy. When treating a pregnant woman with PEXEVA®, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating depression with an antidepressant. This decision can only be made on a case by case basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Like many other drugs, paroxetine is secreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from PEXEVA, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing infants or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PEXEVA in pediatric patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning] . Effectiveness was not demonstrated in three placebo-controlled trials in 752 paroxetine-treated pediatric patients with MDD. Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with paroxetine and at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo: emotional lability (including self-harm, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, crying, and mood fluctuations), hostility, decreased appetite, tremor, sweating, hyperkinesia, and agitation. Adverse reactions upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen, which occurred in at least 2% of patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo, were: emotional lability (including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, mood changes, and tearfulness), nervousness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain. 8.5 Geriatric Use In premarketing clinical trials with immediate-release paroxetine, 17% of paroxetine-treated patients (approximately 700) were 65 years of age or older. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance in the elderly, and a lower starting dose is recommended; however, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. SSRIs, including PEXEVA, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. The initial dosage of PEXEVA should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment and patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "10 OVERDOSAGE The following have been reported with paroxetine tablet overdosage: Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma. Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co-ingestants including alcohol. Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other pro-serotonergic drugs may have a higher risk). Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a paroxetine overdose. Consider contacting a poison center (1-800-221-2222) or a medical toxicologist for overdose management recommendations."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), and general anxiety disorder (GAD) is unknown, but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. 12.3 Pharmacodynamics Absorption Paroxetine mesylate is completely absorbed after oral dosing of the mesylate salt. In a study in which normal male subjects (n=25) received paroxetine 30 mg tablets daily for 24 days, steady-state paroxetine concentrations were achieved by approximately 13 days for most subjects, although it may take substantially longer in an occasional patient. At steady state, mean values of Cmax, Tmax, Cmin, and T1/2 were 81.3 ng/ml (CV 41%), 8.1 hr. (CV 56%), 43.2 ng/ml (CV 52%), and 33.2 hr. (CV 52%), respectively. The steady-state Cmax and Cmin values were about 7 and 10 times what would be predicted from single dose studies. Steady-state drug exposure based on AUC0-24 was about 10 times greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data in these subjects. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that one of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of 20 to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway. In comparison to Cmin values after 20 mg daily, values after 40 mg were only about 2 to 3 times greater than doubled. In a meta-analysis of paroxetine from 4 studies done in healthy volunteers following multiple dosing of 20 mg/day to 40 mg/day, males did not exhibit a significantly lower Cmax or AUC than females. Effect of Food The effects of food on the bioavailability of paroxetine were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. AUC was only slightly increased (6%) when drug was administered with food but the Cmax was 29% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration decreased from 6.4 hours post-dosing to 4.9 hours. Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/ml and 400 ng/ml, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/ml. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. Elimination Metabolism The elimination half-life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of PEXEVA. Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by cytochrome CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions [see Drug interactions (7)] . Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers). Excretion Approximately 64% of a 30 mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Drug Interaction Studies: There are clinically significant drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Potential Effect of PEXEVA on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4 An in vivo drug interaction study involving the co-administration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for cytochrome CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for CYP3A4, including astemizole, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Based on the assumption that the relationship between paroxetine’s in vitro Ki and its lack of effect on terfenadine’s in vivo clearance predicts its effect on other CYP3A4 substrates, paroxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Pimozide: Higher doses of paroxetine have been shown to elevate plasma levels of pimozide. In a controlled study of healthy volunteers, after paroxetine was titrated to 60 mg daily, co-administration of a single dose of 2 mg pimozide was associated with mean increases in pimozide AUC of 151% and Cmax of 62%, compared to pimozide administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Tamoxifen: It is uncertain whether the co-administration of paroxetine and tamoxifen has a significant adverse effect on the efficacy of tamoxifen. Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced when co-prescribed with paroxetine as a result of paroxetine’s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Desipramine: In one study, daily dosing of paroxetine (20 mg once daily) under steady-state conditions increased single dose desipramine (100 mg) Cmax, AUC, and T1/2 by an average of approximately 2-, 5-, and 3-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Risperidone: Daily dosing of paroxetine 20 mg in patients stabilized on risperidone (4 to 8 mg/day), a CYP2D6 substrate, increased mean plasma concentrations of risperidone approximately 4-fold, decreased 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations approximately 10%, and increased concentrations of the active moiety (the sum of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) approximately 1.4-fold [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Atomoxetine: The effect of paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine has been evaluated when both drugs were at steady state. In healthy volunteers who were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6, paroxetine 20 mg daily was given in combination with 20 mg atomoxetine every 12 hours. This resulted in increases in steady-state atomoxetine AUC values that were 6- to 8-fold greater and in atomoxetine Cmax values that were 3- to 4-fold greater than when atomoxetine was given alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Digoxin: Mean digoxin AUC at steady state decreased by 15% in the presence of paroxetine [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Beta Blockers: In a study in which propranolol (80 mg twice daily) was dosed orally for 18 days, the steady-state plasma concentrations of propranolol were unaltered during co-administration with paroxetine (30 mg once daily) for the final 10 days. The effects of propranolol on paroxetine have not been evaluated. Potential Effect of Other Drugs on PEXEVA Concomitant use of paroxetine with other drugs that alter CYP enzymes activities including CYP2D6 may affect the plasma concentrations of paroxetine. Specific studies investigating the effect of other drugs on paroxetine are listed below: Cimetidine: Cimetidine inhibits many cytochrome P450 enzymes. In a study in which paroxetine (30 mg once daily) was dosed orally for 4 weeks, steady-state plasma concentrations of paroxetine were increased by approximately 50% during co-administration with oral cimetidine (300 mg three times daily) for the final week [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Phenobarbital: Phenobarbital induces many cytochrome P450 enzymes. When a single oral 30 mg dose of paroxetine was administered at phenobarbital steady state (100 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T1/2 were reduced (by an average of 25% and 38%, respectively) compared to paroxetine administered alone. The effect of paroxetine on phenobarbital pharmacokinetics was not studied. Because paroxetine exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the results of this study may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Phenytoin: When a single oral 30 mg dose of paroxetine was administered at phenytoin steady state (300 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and T1/2 were reduced (by an average of 50% and 35%, respectively) compared to paroxetine administered alone. In a separate study, when a single oral 300 mg dose of phenytoin was administered at paroxetine steady state (30 mg once daily for 14 days), phenytoin AUC was slightly reduced (12% on average) compared to phenytoin administered alone. Because both drugs exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the above studies may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Digoxin: A clinical drug interaction study showed that concurrent use of digoxin did not affect paroxetine exposure. Diazepam: A clinical drug interaction study showed that concurrent use of diazepam did not affect paroxetine exposure."

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis: Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rodents given paroxetine in the diet at 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg/day (mice) and 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg/day (rats). These doses are 2.0 (mouse) and 3 (rat) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg on a mg/m2 basis. There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high-dose group with reticulum cell sarcomas (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose-related increase in the number of tumors in mice, there was no drug-related increase in the number of mice with tumors. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis: Paroxetine produced no genotoxic effects in a battery of 5 in vitro and 2 in vivo assays that included the following: bacterial mutation assay, mouse lymphoma mutation assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes and in a dominant lethal test in rats. Impairment of Fertility: Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs (including paroxetine) may affect sperm quality during SSRI treatment, which may affect fertility in some men. A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is 2 times the MRHD of 60 mg on a mg/m2 basis. Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg/kg/day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg/kg/day (8 and 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg on a mg/m2 basis)."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Major Depressive Disorder The efficacy of paroxetine as a treatment for MDD has been established in 6 placebo-controlled studies of patients with MDD (ages 18 to 73). In these studies, paroxetine was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo in treating MDD by at least 2 of the following measures: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton depressed mood item, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity of Illness. Paroxetine was statistically significantly better than placebo in improvement of the HDRS sub-factor scores, including the depressed mood item, sleep disturbance factor, and anxiety factor. Long-term efficacy of paroxetine for treatment of MDD in outpatients was demonstrated in a randomized withdrawal study. Patients who responded to paroxetine (HDRS total score <8) during an initial 8-week open-label treatment phase were then randomized to continue paroxetine or placebo, for up to 1 year. Patients treated with paroxetine demonstrated a statistically significant lower relapse rate during the withdrawal phase (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients. 14.2 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment OCD was demonstrated in two 12-week multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1 and 2). Patients had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-IIIR) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 26. In study 1, a dose-range finding study, patients received fixed daily doses of paroxetine 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg. Study 1 demonstrated that daily doses of paroxetine 40 mg and 60 mg are effective in the treatment of OCD. Patients receiving paroxetine 40 mg and 60 mg To experienced a mean reduction of approximately 6 and 7 points, respectively, on the YBOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the approximate 4-point reduction at 20 mg and a 3-point reduction in the placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a flexible dose study comparing paroxetine (20 mg to 60 mg daily) with clomipramine (25 mg to 250 mg daily or placebo). In this study, patients receiving paroxetine experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score, which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in the placebo-treated patients. Table 10 provides the outcome classification by treatment group on Global Improvement items of the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale for Study 1. Table 10: Outcome Classification (%) on CGI-Global Improvement Item for Completers in Study 1 in Patients with OCD Outcome Classification Placebo (N=74) % Paroxetine 20 mg (N=75) % Paroxetine 40 mg (N=66) % Paroxetine 60 mg (N=66) % Worse 14 7 7 3 No Change 44 35 22 19 Minimally Improved 24 33 29 34 Much Improved 11 18 22 24 Very Much Improved 7 7 20 20 Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. The long-term efficacy of paroxetine for the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in a long-term extension to Study 1. Patients who responded to paroxetine during the 3-month double-blind phase and a 6-month extension on open-label paroxetine (20 mg to 60 mg daily) were randomized to either paroxetine or placebo in a 6-month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than comparably treated patients who were randomized to placebo. 14.3 Panic Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of panic disorder (PD) was demonstrated in three 10- to 12-week multicenter, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1-3). Patients in all studies had PD (DSM-IIIR), with or without agoraphobia. In these studies, paroxetine was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo in treating PD by at least 2 out of 3 measures of panic attack frequency and on the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness score. Study 1 was a 10-week dose-range finding study: patients received fixed doses of paroxetine doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily or placebo. A statistically significant difference from placebo was observed only for the paroxetine 40 mg daily group. At endpoint, 76% of patients receiving paroxetine 40 mg daily were free of panic attacks, compared to 44% of placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 10 mg to 60 mg daily and placebo. At endpoint, 51% of paroxetine-treated patients were free of panic attacks compared to 32% of placebo-treated patients. Study 3 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 10 mg to 60 mg daily to placebo in patients concurrently receiving standardized cognitive behavioral therapy. At endpoint, 33% of the paroxetine-treated patients showed a reduction to 0 or 1 panic attacks compared to 14% of placebo-treated patients. In Studies 2 and 3, the mean paroxetine dose for completers at endpoint was approximately 40 mg daily. Long-term maintenance efficacy of paroxetine in PD was demonstrated in an extension to Study 1. Patients who responded to paroxetine during the 10-week double-blind phase and during a 3-month double-blind extension phase were randomized to either paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily or placebo in a 3-month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than comparably treated patients who were randomized to placebo. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. 14.4 Generalized Anxiety Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was demonstrated in two 8-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) of adult outpatients with GAD (DSM-IV). Study 1 was an 8-week study comparing fixed doses of paroxetine 20 mg or 40 mg daily with placebo. Doses of paroxetine 20 mg or 40 mg were both demonstrated to be statistically significantly superior to placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score. There was not sufficient evidence in this study to suggest a greater benefit for the paroxetine 40 mg daily dose compared to the 20 mg daily dose. Study 2 was a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily and placebo. Paroxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score. A third study, a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily to placebo, did not demonstrate statistically significant superiority of paroxetine over placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score, the primary outcome. Subgroup analyses did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of race or gender. There were insufficient elderly patients to conduct subgroup analyses on the basis of age. In a long-term trial, 566 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD, who had responded during a single-blind, 8-week acute treatment phase with paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily , were randomized to continuation of paroxetine at their same dose, or to placebo, for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the single-blind phase was defined by having a decrease of ≥2 points compared to baseline on the CGI-Severity of Illness scale, to a score of ≤3. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of ≥2 points compared to baseline on the CGI-Severity of Illness scale to a score of ≥4, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. Patients continuing to receive paroxetine experienced a statistically significantly lower relapse rate over the subsequent 24 weeks compared to those receiving placebo."
