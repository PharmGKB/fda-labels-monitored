        "PATIENT INFORMATION LENVIMA ® (lehn-veema) (lenvatinib) capsules What is LENVIMA? LENVIMA is a prescription medicine that is used to treat certain kinds of cancer. LENVIMA is used by itself to treat differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), a type of thyroid cancer that can no longer be treated with radioactive iodine and is progressing. LENVIMA is used along with another medicine called everolimus to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a type of kidney cancer, after one course of treatment with another anti-cancer medicine. LENVIMA is used by itself as the first treatment for a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when it cannot be removed by surgery. LENVIMA is used along with another medicine called pembrolizumab to treat advanced endometrial carcinoma, a type of uterine cancer: that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), and that has progressed after treatment with anti-cancer medicine, and that cannot be treated with surgery or radiation. It is not known if LENVIMA is safe and effective in children. Before you take LENVIMA, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have high blood pressure have heart problems have a history of blood clots in your arteries (type of blood vessel), including stroke, heart attack, or change in vision have or have had liver or kidney problems have a history of a tear (perforation) in your stomach or intestine, or an abnormal connection between two or more body parts (fistula) have headaches, seizures, or vision problems have any bleeding problems plan to have surgery, a dental procedure or have had a recent surgery. You should stop taking LENVIMA at least 1 week before planned surgery. See “What are the possible side effects of LENVIMA ?” are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. LENVIMA can harm your unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant : ○ Your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with LENVIMA. ○ You should use an effective method of birth control during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 30 days after the last dose of LENVIMA. Talk with your healthcare provider about birth control methods you can use during this time. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you are pregnant during treatment with LENVIMA. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if LENVIMA passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 1 week after the last dose.

Especially t ell your healthcare provider if you are taking, or have taken, an osteoporosis medicine. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of your medicines to show to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take LENVIMA? Take LENVIMA exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much LENVIMA to take and when to take it. Your healthcare provider may change your dose during treatment, stop treatment for some time, or completely stop treatment with LENVIMA if you have side effects. Take LENVIMA 1 time each day at the same time, with or without food. If you miss a dose of LENVIMA, take it as soon as you remember. If your next dose is due within 12 hours, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at your regular time. If you cannot swallow LENVIMA capsules whole: ○ Use a medicine cup to measure about one tablespoon of water or apple juice and place into a small glass. ○ Place the LENVIMA capsules into the small glass without breaking or crushing them. ○ Leave the capsules in the liquid for at least 10 minutes. ○ Stir the contents of the glass for at least 3 minutes. ○ Drink the mixture. After drinking, rinse the glass with a small amount of additional water or apple juice and swallow the liquid. If you take too much LENVIMA, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. What are the possible side effects of LENVIMA? LENVIMA may cause serious side effects, including: high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure is a common side effect of LENVIMA and can be serious. Your blood pressure should be well controlled before you start taking LENVIMA. Your healthcare provider should check your blood pressure regularly during treatment with LENVIMA. If you develop blood pressure problems, your healthcare provider may prescribe medicine to treat your high blood pressure. heart problems. LENVIMA can cause serious heart problems that may lead to death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get symptoms of heart problems, such as shortness of breath or swelling of your ankles. problem with blood clots in your blood vessels (arteries). Get emergency medical help right away if you get any of the following symptoms: ○ severe chest pain or pressure ○ trouble talking ○ pain in your arms, back, neck or jaw ○ sudden severe headache ○ shortness of breath ○ sudden vision changes ○ numbness or weakness on one side of your body liver problems. LENVIMA may cause liver problems that may lead to liver failure and death. Your healthcare provider will check your liver function before and during treatment with LENVIMA. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms: ○ your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice) ○ dark “tea colored” urine ○ light-colored bowel movements (stools) ○ feeling drowsy, confused or loss of consciousness kidney problems. Kidney failure, which can lead to death, has happened with LENVIMA treatment. Your healthcare provider should do regular blood tests to check your kidneys. increased protein in your urine (proteinuria). Proteinuria is a common side effect of LENVIMA and can be serious. Your healthcare provider should check your urine for protein before and during your treatment with LENVIMA. diarrhea. Diarrhea is a common side effect of LENVIMA and can be serious. If you get diarrhea, ask your healthcare provider about what medicines you can take to treat your diarrhea. It is important to drink more water when you get diarrhea. Tell your healthcare provider or go to the emergency room, if you are unable to drink enough liquids and your diarrhea is not able to be controlled. an opening in the wall of your stomach or intestines (perforation) or an abnormal connection between two or more body parts (fistula). Get emergency medical help right away if you have severe stomach (abdomen) pain. changes in the electrical activity of your heart called QT prolongation. QT prolongation can cause irregular heartbeats that can be life threatening. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests before and during your treatment with LENVIMA to check the levels of potassium, magnesium, and calcium in your blood, and may check the electrical activity of your heart with an ECG. low levels of blood calcium (hypocalcemia). Your healthcare provider will check your blood calcium levels during treatment with LENVIMA and may tell you to take a calcium supplement if your calcium levels are low. a condition called Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Call your healthcare provider right away if you get: severe headache, seizures, weakness, confusion, or blindness or change in vision. bleeding. LENVIMA may cause serious bleeding problems that may lead to death. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any signs or symptoms of bleeding during treatment with LENVIMA, including: ○ severe and persistent nose bleeds ○ blood in your urine ○ vomiting blood ○ coughing up blood or blood clots ○ red or black (looks like tar) stools ○ heavy or new onset vaginal bleeding change in thyroid hormone levels . Your healthcare provider should check your thyroid hormone levels before starting and every month during treatment with LENVIMA. wound healing problems. Wound healing problems have happened in some people who take LENVIMA. Tell your healthcare provider if you plan to have any surgery before or during treatment with LENVIMA. You should stop taking LENVIMA at least 1 week before planned surgery. Your healthcare provider should tell you when you may start taking LENVIMA again after surgery. severe jaw bone problems (osteonecrosis). Severe jaw bone problems have happened in some people who take LENVIMA. Certain risk factors such as taking a bisphosphonate medicine or the medicine denosumab, having dental disease, or an invasive dental procedure may increase your risk of getting jaw bone problems. Your healthcare provider should examine your mouth before you start and during treatment with LENVIMA. Tell your dentist that you are taking LENVIMA. It is important for you to practice good mouth care during treatment with LENVIMA. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get signs or symptoms of jaw bone problems during treatment with LENVIMA, including jaw pain, toothache, or sores on your gums. Tell your healthcare provider if you plan to have any dental procedures before or during treatment with LENVIMA. You should avoid having invasive dental procedures if possible, during treatment with LENVIMA. Stopping your bisphosphonate medicine before an invasive dental procedure may help decrease your risk of getting these jaw problems. You should stop taking LENVIMA at least 1 week before planned dental surgery or invasive dental procedures. Your healthcare provider should tell you when you may start taking LENVIMA again after dental procedures.

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of F ertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with lenvatinib. Lenvatinib mesylate was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay. Lenvatinib was not clastogenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay or the in vivo rat micronucleus assay. No specific studies with lenvatinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility; however, results from general toxicology studies in rats, monkeys, and dogs suggest there is a potential for lenvatinib to impair fertility. Male dogs exhibited testicular hypocellularity of the seminiferous epithelium and desquamated seminiferous epithelial cells in the epididymides at lenvatinib exposures approximately 0.02 to 0.09 times the AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg once daily. Follicular atresia of the ovaries was observed in monkeys and rats at exposures 0.2 to 0.8 times and 10 to 44 times the AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg once daily, respectively. In addition, in monkeys, a decreased incidence of menstruation was reported at lenvatinib exposures lower than those observed in humans at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg once daily."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Lenvatinib is a kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib also exhibited antiproliferative activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines dependent on activated FGFR signaling with a concurrent inhibition of FGF-receptor substrate 2α (FRS2α) phosphorylation. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, lenvatinib decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone. The combination of lenvatinib and everolimus showed increased antiangiogenic and antitumor activity as demonstrated by decreases in human endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signaling in vitro, and by decreases in tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer that were greater than those with either drug alone."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12. 3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with solid tumors administered single and multiple doses of LENVIMA once daily, the maximum lenvatinib plasma concentration (C max ) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased proportionally over the dose range of 3.2 mg (0.1 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg) to 32 mg (1.33 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg) with a median accumulation index of 0.96 (20 mg) to 1.54 (6.4 mg). Absorption The time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) typically occurred from 1 to 4 hours post-dose. Food Effect Administration with a high fat meal (approximately 900 calories of which approximately 55% were from fat, 15% from protein, and 30% from carbohydrates) did not affect the extent of absorption, but decreased the rate of absorption and delayed the median T max from 2 hours to 4 hours. Distribution In vitro binding of lenvatinib to human plasma proteins ranged from 98% to 99% at concentrations of 0.3 to 30 μg/mL. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.59 to 0.61 at concentrations of 0.1 to 10 μg/mL in vitro. Elimination The terminal elimination half-life of lenvatinib was approximately 28 hours. Metabolism The main metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in humans were identified as enzymatic (CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase) and non-enzymatic processes. Excretion Ten days after a single administration of radiolabeled lenvatinib, approximately 64% and 25% of the radiolabel were eliminated in the feces and urine, respectively. Specific Populations Age, sex, and race did not have a significant effect on apparent oral clearance (CL/F). Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 24 mg dose were evaluated in subjects with mild (CLcr 60-89 mL/min), moderate (CLcr 30-59 mL/min), or severe (CLcr <30 mL/min) renal impairment, and compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with end stage renal disease were not studied. The AUC 0-inf for subjects with renal impairment were similar compared to those for healthy subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 10 mg dose were evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of a single 5 mg dose were evaluated in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, the dose-adjusted AUC 0-inf of lenvatinib for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were 119%, 107%, and 180%, respectively. Apparent oral clearance of lenvatinib in patients with HCC and mild hepatic impairment was similar to patients with HCC and moderate hepatic impairment. Tumor Patients with HCC in REFLECT had a 13% lower lenvatinib CL/F than patients with other cancer types. Body Weight Lenvatinib exposures in patients with HCC in REFLECT were comparable between those weighing <60 kg who received a starting dose of 8 mg and those ≥60 kg who received a starting dose of 12 mg. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Lenvatinib CYP3A, P-gp, and BCRP Inhibitor s : Ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 18 days) increased lenvatinib (administered as a single 5 mg dose on Day 5) AUC by 15% and C max by 19%. P-gp Inhibitor : Rifampicin (600 mg as a single dose) increased lenvatinib (24 mg as a single dose) AUC by 31% and C max by 33%. CYP3A and P-gp Inducers : Rifampicin (600 mg daily for 21 days) decreased lenvatinib (24 mg as a single dose on Day 15) AUC by 18%. The C max was unchanged. In Vitro Studies with Transporters: Lenvatinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP but not a substrate for organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) 1, MATE2-K, or the bile salt export pump (BSEP). Effect of Lenvatinib on Other Drugs Clinical Studies with Substrates of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8: There is no projected significant drug-drug interaction risk between lenvatinib and midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) or repaglinide (a CYP2C8 substrate). In Vitro Studies with Substrates of CYP or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): Lenvatinib inhibits CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Lenvatinib does not inhibit CYP2A6 and CYP2E1. Lenvatinib induces CYP3A, but it does not induce CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9. Lenvatinib inhibits UGT1A1, UGT1A4, and UGT1A9 in vitro, but likely only inhibits UGT1A1 in vivo in the gastrointestinal tract based on the expression of the enzyme in tissues. Lenvatinib does not inhibit UGT1A6, UGT2B7 or aldehyde oxidase. Lenvatinib does not induce UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. In Vitro Studies with Substrates of Transporter s : Lenvatinib does not have the potential to inhibit MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, BSEP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3 in vivo."

        "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Data Daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate to juvenile rats for 8 weeks starting on postnatal day 21 (approximately equal to a human pediatric age of 2 years) resulted in growth retardation (decreased body weight gain, decreased food consumption, and decreases in the width and/or length of the femur and tibia) and secondary delays in physical development and reproductive organ immaturity at doses greater than or equal to 2 mg/kg (approximately 1.2 to 5 times the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg). Decreased length of the femur and tibia persisted following 4 weeks of recovery. In general, the toxicologic profile of lenvatinib was similar between juvenile and adult rats, though toxicities including broken teeth at all dose levels and mortality at the 10 mg/kg/day dose level (attributed to primary duodenal lesions) occurred at earlier treatment time-points in juvenile rats."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended human doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits ( see Data ) . There are no available human data informing the drug-associated risk. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryofetal development study, daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate at doses ≥0.3 mg/kg [approximately 0.14 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on body surface area (BSA)] to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in dose-related decreases in mean fetal body weight, delayed fetal ossifications, and dose-related increases in fetal external (parietal edema and tail abnormalities), visceral, and skeletal anomalies. Greater than 80% postimplantation loss was observed at 1.0 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA). Daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetal external (short tail), visceral (retroesophageal subclavian artery), and skeletal anomalies at doses greater than or equal to 0.03 mg/kg (approximately 0.03 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA). At the 0.03 mg/kg dose, increased post-implantation loss, including 1 fetal death, was also observed. Lenvatinib was abortifacient in rabbits, resulting in late abortions in approximately one-third of the rabbits treated at a dose level of 0.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA)."

Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC or HCC, Grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction (including cardiomyopathy, left or right ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure, cardiac failure, ventricular hypokinesia, or decrease in left or right ventricular ejection fraction of more than 20% from baseline) occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor patients for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] . 5.3 Arterial Thromboembolic Events Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA with everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in Study 205 (RCC), 2% of patients in REFLECT (HCC) and 5% of patients in SELECT (DTC). Grade 3 to 5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Permanently discontinue LENVIMA following an arterial thrombotic event [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] . The safety of resuming LENVIMA after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Across clinical studies enrolling 1327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events, including hepatic failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of patients. In REFLECT (HCC), hepatic encephalopathy (including hepatic encephalopathy, encephalopathy, metabolic encephalopathy, and hepatic coma) occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and 3% of sorafenib-treated patients. Grade 3 to 5 hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients and 2% of sorafenib-treated patients.

Two percent of patients discontinued LENVIMA and 0.2% discontinued sorafenib due to hepatic encephalopathy and 1% of patients discontinued lenvatinib or sorafenib due to hepatic failure [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor liver function prior to initiating LENVIMA, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Monitor patients with HCC closely for signs of hepatic failure, including hepatic encephalopathy. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] . 5.5 Renal Failure or Impairment Serious including fatal renal failure or impairment can occur with LENVIMA. Renal impairment occurred in 14% of patients receiving LENVIMA in SELECT (DTC) and in 7% of patients receiving LENVIMA in REFLECT (HCC). Grade 3 to 5 renal failure or impairment occurred in 3% (DTC) and 2% (HCC) of patients, including 1 fatality in each study. In Study 205 (RCC), renal impairment or renal failure occurred in 18% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus, including Grade 3 in 10% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Initiate prompt management of diarrhea or dehydration/hypovolemia. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA for renal failure or impairment based on severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] . 5. 6 Proteinuria Proteinuria occurred in 34% of LENVIMA-treated patients in SELECT (DTC) and in 26% of LENVIMA-treated patients in REFLECT (HCC). Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 11% and 6% in SELECT and REFLECT, respectively. In Study 205 (RCC), proteinuria occurred in 31% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus and 14% of patients receiving everolimus. Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 8% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus compared to 2% of patients receiving everolimus [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor for proteinuria prior to initiating LENVIMA and periodically during treatment. If urine dipstick proteinuria greater than or equal to 2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] . 5. 7 Diarrhea Of the 737 patients treated with LENVIMA in SELECT (DTC) and REFLECT (HCC), diarrhea occurred in 49% of patients, including Grade 3 in 6%. In Study 205 (RCC), diarrhea occurred in 81% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus, including Grade 3 in 19%. Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] . 5. 8 Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation Of 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA with everolimus in SELECT (DTC), Study 205 (RCC) and REFLECT (HCC), fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%. Permanently discontinue LENVIMA in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any severity or Grade 3 or 4 fistula [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. 5. 9 QT Interval Prolongation In SELECT (DTC), QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of >500 ms occurred in 2%. In Study 205 (RCC), QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 11% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 6%. In REFLECT (HCC), QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%. Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose of LENVIMA upon recovery based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . 5. 10 Hypocalcemia In SELECT (DTC), Grade 3 to 4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of patients receiving LENVIMA. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation, with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In Study 205 (RCC), Grade 3 to 4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of patients treated with LENVIMA with everolimus. In REFLECT (HCC), Grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA depending on severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] . 5.1 1 Reversible Posterior Leukoe ncephalopathy Syndrome Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent [see Adverse Reaction ( 6.1 )] , reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) occurred in 0.3%. Confirm the diagnosis of RPLS with magnetic resonance imaging. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . 5.1 2 Hemorrhagic E vents Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. Across SELECT (DTC), Study 205 (RCC) and REFLECT (HCC), hemorrhagic events of any grade occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In SELECT, Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients receiving LENVIMA, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In Study 205, Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In REFLECT, Grade 3 to 5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of patients receiving LENVIMA, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Serious tumor related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in patients treated with LENVIMA in clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting. In post-marketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than in other tumor types. The safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue LENVIMA based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] . 5.1 3 Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression /Thyroid Dysfunction LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In SELECT (DTC), 88% of all patients had a baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In those patients with a normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus in Study 205 (RCC) and in 21% of patients receiving LENVIMA in REFLECT (HCC). In those patients with a normal or low TSH at baseline, an elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of patients receiving LENVIMA in REFLECT and 60% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus in Study 205 [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor thyroid function prior to initiating LENVIMA and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice. 5.14 Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.15 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ. Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ. Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution. 5. 1 6 Embryo -F etal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 30 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ] ."

The data in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to LENVIMA as a single agent in 261 patients with DTC (SELECT) and 476 patients with HCC (REFLECT), LENVIMA with pembrolizumab in 94 patients with endometrial carcinoma (Study 111), and LENVIMA with everolimus in 62 patients with RCC (Study 205). Safety data obtained in 1823 patients with advanced solid tumors who received LENVIMA as a single agent across multiple clinical studies was used to further characterize the risks of serious adverse reactions. Among the 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, the median age was 61 years (20 to 89 years), the dose range was 0.2 mg to 32 mg daily, and the median duration of exposure was 5.6 months. The data below reflect exposure to LENVIMA in 893 patients enrolled in randomized, active-controlled trials (REFLECT; Study 205), a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (SELECT) and a single arm trial (Study 111). The median duration of exposure to LENVIMA across these four studies ranged from 6 to 16 months. The demographic and exposure data for each clinical trial population are described in the subsections below. Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The safety of LENVIMA was evaluated in SELECT, in which patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer were randomized (2:1) to LENVIMA (n=261) or placebo (n=131) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The median treatment duration was 16.1 months for LENVIMA. Among 261 patients who received LENVIMA, median age was 64 years, 52% were females, 80% were White, 18% were Asian, and 2% were Black; and 4% were Hispanic/Latino. The most common adverse reactions observed in LENVIMA-treated patients (≥30%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased appetite, decreased weight, nausea, stomatitis, headache, vomiting, proteinuria, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, abdominal pain, and dysphonia. The most common serious adverse reactions (at least 2%) were pneumonia (4%), hypertension (3%), and dehydration (3%). Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 68% of patients receiving LENVIMA; 18% of patients discontinued LENVIMA for adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions (at least 10%) resulting in dose reductions of LENVIMA were hypertension (13%), proteinuria (11%), decreased appetite (10%), and diarrhea (10%); the most common adverse reactions (at least 1%) resulting in discontinuation of LENVIMA were hypertension (1%) and asthenia (1%). Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring at a higher rate in LENVIMA-treated patients than patients receiving placebo in the double-blind phase of the study.

LENVIMA (n = 253 to 258), Placebo (n = 129 to 131) The following laboratory abnormalities (all Grades) occurred in >5% of LENVIMA-treated patients and at a rate that was two-fold or higher than in patients who received placebo: hypoalbuminemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypomagnesemia, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypercalcemia, hypercholesterolemia, increased serum amylase, and hyperkalemia. Renal Cell Carcinoma The safety of LENVIMA was evaluated in Study 205, in which patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were randomized (1:1:1) to LENVIMA 18 mg orally once daily with everolimus 5 mg orally once daily (n=51), LENVIMA 24 mg orally once daily (n=52), or everolimus 10 mg orally once daily (n=50) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] . This data also includes patients on the dose escalation portion of the study who received LENVIMA with everolimus (n=11). The median treatment duration was 8.1 months for LENVIMA with everolimus. Among 62 patients who received LENVIMA with everolimus, the median age was 61 years, 71% were men, and 98% were White. The most common adverse reactions observed in the LENVIMA with everolimus-treated group (≥30%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, diarrhea, fatigue, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased appetite, vomiting, nausea, stomatitis/oral inflammation, hypertension, peripheral edema, cough, abdominal pain, dyspnea, rash, decreased weight, hemorrhagic events, and proteinuria. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥5%) were renal failure (11%), dehydration (10%), anemia (6%), thrombocytopenia (5%), diarrhea (5%), vomiting (5%), and dyspnea (5%). Adverse reactions led to dose reductions or interruption in 89% of patients receiving LENVIMA with everolimus. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) resulting in dose reductions in the LENVIMA with everolimus-treated group were diarrhea (21%), fatigue (8%), thrombocytopenia (6%), vomiting (6%), nausea (5%), and proteinuria (5%). Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 29% of patients in the LENVIMA with everolimus-treated group. Table 5 presents the adverse reactions in >15% of patients in the LENVIMA with everolimus arm. Study 205 was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for LENVIMA in combination with everolimus, as compared to everolimus for any specific adverse reaction listed in Table 5.

LENVIMA with Everolimus (n = 62), Everolimus (n = 50). Hepatocellular Carcinoma The safety of LENVIMA was evaluated in REFLECT, which randomized (1:1) patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to LENVIMA (n=476) or sorafenib (n=475) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ] . The dose of LENVIMA was 12 mg orally once daily for patients with a baseline body weight of ≥60 kg and 8 mg orally once daily for patients with a baseline body weight of <60 kg. The dose of sorafenib was 400 mg orally twice daily. Duration of treatment was ≥6 months in 49% and 32% of patients in the LENVIMA and sorafenib groups, respectively. Among the 476 patients who received LENVIMA in REFLECT, the median age was 63 years, 85% were men, 28% were White and 70% were Asian. The most common adverse reactions observed in the LENVIMA-treated patients (≥20%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased weight, abdominal pain, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, proteinuria, dysphonia, hemorrhagic events, hypothyroidism, and nausea. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥2%) in LENVIMA-treated patients were hepatic encephalopathy (5%), hepatic failure (3%), ascites (3%), and decreased appetite (2%). Adverse reactions led to dose reduction or interruption in 62% of patients receiving LENVIMA. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) resulting in dose reduction or interruption of LENVIMA were fatigue (9%), decreased appetite (8%), diarrhea (8%), proteinuria (7%), hypertension (6%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (5%). Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients in the LENVIMA-treated group. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) resulting in discontinuation of LENVIMA were fatigue (1%), hepatic encephalopathy (2%), hyperbilirubinemia (1%), and hepatic failure (1%). Table 7 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥10% of patients receiving LENVIMA in REFLECT.

LENVIMA (n=278 to 470) and sorafenib (n=260 to 473) Endometrial Carcinoma The safety of LENVIMA (20 mg orally once daily) in combination with pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) was evaluated in Study 111, a single-arm, multicenter, open-label trial in 94 patients with endometrial carcinoma whose tumors had progressed following one line of systemic therapy and were not MSI-H or dMMR [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. The median duration of study treatment was 7 months (range: 0.03 to 37.8 months). Pembrolizumab was continued for a maximum of 24 months; however, treatment with LENVIMA could be continued beyond 24 months. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients treated with LENVIMA and pembrolizumab, including gastrointestinal perforation, RPLS with intraventricular hemorrhage, and intracranial hemorrhage. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients receiving LENVIMA and pembrolizumab. Serious adverse reactions in ≥3% of patients were hypertension (9%), abdominal pain (6%), musculoskeletal pain (5%), hemorrhage (4%), fatigue (4%), nausea (4%), confusional state (4%), pleural effusion (4%), adrenal insufficiency (3%), colitis (3%), dyspnea (3%), and pyrexia (3%). Permanent discontinuation due to adverse reaction (Grade 1-4) occurred in 21% of patients who received LENVIMA and pembrolizumab. The most common adverse reactions (>2%) resulting in discontinuation of LENVIMA were gastrointestinal perforation or fistula (2%), muscular weakness (2%), and pancreatitis (2%). Adverse reactions led to dose reduction or interruption in 88% of patients receiving LENVIMA. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) resulting in dose reduction or interruption of LENVIMA were fatigue (32%), hypertension (26%), diarrhea (18%), nausea (13%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (13%), vomiting (13%), decreased appetite (12%), musculoskeletal pain (11%), stomatitis (9%), abdominal pain (7%), hemorrhages (7%), renal impairment (6%), decreased weight (6%), rash (5%), headache (5%), increased lipase (5%), and proteinuria (5%).

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended human doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits ( see Data ) . There are no available human data informing the drug-associated risk. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryofetal development study, daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate at doses ≥0.3 mg/kg [approximately 0.14 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on body surface area (BSA)] to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in dose-related decreases in mean fetal body weight, delayed fetal ossifications, and dose-related increases in fetal external (parietal edema and tail abnormalities), visceral, and skeletal anomalies. Greater than 80% postimplantation loss was observed at 1.0 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA). Daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetal external (short tail), visceral (retroesophageal subclavian artery), and skeletal anomalies at doses greater than or equal to 0.03 mg/kg (approximately 0.03 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA). At the 0.03 mg/kg dose, increased post-implantation loss, including 1 fetal death, was also observed. Lenvatinib was abortifacient in rabbits, resulting in late abortions in approximately one-third of the rabbits treated at a dose level of 0.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether LENVIMA is present in human milk; however, lenvatinib and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk at concentrations higher than those in maternal plasma ( see Data ) . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 1 week after the last dose. Data Animal Data Following administration of radiolabeled lenvatinib to lactating Sprague Dawley rats, lenvatinib-related radioactivity was approximately 2 times higher [based on area under the curve (AUC)] in milk compared to maternal plasma. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LENVIMA [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Contraception Based on its mechanism of action, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 30 days after the last dose. Infertility LENVIMA may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in pediatric patients have not been established. Juvenile Animal Data Daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate to juvenile rats for 8 weeks starting on postnatal day 21 (approximately equal to a human pediatric age of 2 years) resulted in growth retardation (decreased body weight gain, decreased food consumption, and decreases in the width and/or length of the femur and tibia) and secondary delays in physical development and reproductive organ immaturity at doses greater than or equal to 2 mg/kg (approximately 1.2 to 5 times the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg). Decreased length of the femur and tibia persisted following 4 weeks of recovery. In general, the toxicologic profile of lenvatinib was similar between juvenile and adult rats, though toxicities including broken teeth at all dose levels and mortality at the 10 mg/kg/day dose level (attributed to primary duodenal lesions) occurred at earlier treatment time-points in juvenile rats. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 261 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who received LENVIMA in SELECT, 45% were ≥65 years of age and 11% were ≥75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Of the 62 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who received LENVIMA with everolimus in Study 205, 36% were ≥65 years of age. Conclusions are limited due to the small sample size, but there appeared to be no overall differences in safety or effectiveness between these subjects and younger subjects. Of the 476 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who received LENVIMA in REFLECT, 44% were ≥65 years of age and 12% were ≥75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients ≥65 and younger subjects. Patients ≥75 years of age showed reduced tolerability to LENVIMA. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (CLcr 60-89 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr 30-59 mL/min) renal impairment. Lenvatinib concentrations may increase in patients with DTC, RCC, or endometrial carcinoma and severe (CLcr 15-29 mL/min) renal impairment. Reduce the dose of lenvatinib for patients with RCC, DTC, or endometrial carcinoma and severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . There is no recommended dose of LENVIMA for patients with HCC and severe renal impairment. LENVIMA has not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with HCC and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). There is no recommended dose for patients with HCC with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with DTC, RCC, or endometrial carcinoma and mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B). Lenvatinib concentrations may increase in patients with DTC, RCC, or endometrial carcinoma and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Reduce the dose of lenvatinib for patients with DTC, RCC, or endometrial carcinoma and severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] ."

Radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory was defined as 1 or more measurable lesions with no iodine uptake on RAI scan, iodine uptake with progression within 12 months of RAI therapy, or having received cumulative RAI activity >600 mCi (22 GBq) with the last dose administered at least 6 months prior to study entry. Patients were randomized to receive LENVIMA 24 mg once daily (n=261) or placebo (n=131) until disease progression. Randomization was stratified by geographic region, prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy, and age. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by blinded independent radiologic review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Independent review confirmation of disease progression was required prior to discontinuing patients from the randomization phase of the study. Other efficacy outcome measures included objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Patients in the placebo arm could receive lenvatinib following independent review confirmation of disease progression. Of the 392 patients randomized, 51% were male, the median age was 63 years, 40% were 65 years or older, 79% were White, 54% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, and 24% had received 1 prior VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy. Metastases were present in 99% of the patients: lungs in 89%, lymph nodes in 52%, bone in 39%, liver in 18%, and brain in 4%. The histological diagnoses were papillary thyroid cancer (66%) and follicular thyroid cancer (34%); of those with follicular histology, 44% had Hürthle cell and 11% had clear cell subtypes. In the LENVIMA arm, 67% of patients did not demonstrate iodine uptake on any RAI scan compared to 77% in the placebo arm. Additionally, 59% of patients on the LENVIMA arm and 61% of patients on placebo arm progressed, according to RECIST 1.1, within 12 months of prior I 131 therapy; 19.2% of patients on the LENVIMA arm and 17.6% of patients on placebo arm received prior cumulative activity of >600 mCi or 22 GBq I 131, with the last dose administered at least 6 months prior to study entry. The median cumulative RAI activity administered prior to study entry was 350 mCi (12.95 GBq). A statistically significant prolongation in PFS was demonstrated in LENVIMA-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo (Table 11 and Figure 1). Upon confirmation of progression, 83% of patients that were randomly assigned to placebo crossed over to receive open-label LENVIMA.

Patients were required to have histological confirmation of clear cell RCC and ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Patients were stratified by hemoglobin level (≤ or >13 g/dL for males and ≤ or >11.5 g/dL for females) and corrected serum calcium (≥10 mg/dL vs. <10 mg/dL). The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. Of the 101 patients randomized to the LENVIMA with everolimus arm or everolimus arm, 72% were male, the median age was 60 years, 31% were older than 65 years, and 96% were White. Metastases were present in 95% of the patients and unresectable advanced disease was present in 5%. All patients had a baseline ECOG PS of either 0 (54%) or 1 (46%) with similar distribution across these two treatment arms. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) favorable, intermediate and poor risk categories were observed respectively, in 24%, 37%, and 39% of patients in the LENVIMA with everolimus arm, and 24%, 38%, and 38% of patients in the everolimus arm. Efficacy results from Study 205 are summarized in Table 12 and Figures 2 and 3. The treatment effect of the combination on PFS was supported by a retrospective independent review of radiographs with an observed hazard ratio (HR) of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.75) compared with the everolimus arm.

The study enrolled adults with Child-Pugh A and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage C or B HCC who were ineligible for local liver-directed therapy; had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1; had received no prior systemic therapy for HCC; and had at least one measurable target lesion according to modified RECIST for HCC. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive LENVIMA (12 mg for baseline body weight ≥60 kg or 8 mg for baseline body weight <60 kg) orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily until radiological disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by region (Western vs Asia Pacific), presence of macroscopic portal vein invasion or extrahepatic spread (yes vs no), ECOG PS (0 vs 1), and body weight (<60 kg vs ≥60 kg). The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). REFLECT was designed to show the non-inferiority of LENVIMA to sorafenib for OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) according to modified RECIST for HCC. A total of 954 patients were randomized, 478 to the LENVIMA arm and 476 to the sorafenib arm. The demographics of the study population were: median age of 62 years (range: 20 to 88 years); 84% male; 69% Asian and 29% White; 63% ECOG PS of 0; and 69% weighed ≥60 kg. Of the 590 (62%) patients with at least one site of documented distant metastatic disease, 52% had lung metastasis, 45% had lymph node metastasis, and 16% had bone metastasis. Macroscopic portal vein invasion, extra-hepatic spread, or both were present in 70% of patients. HCC was categorized as Child-Pugh A and BCLC Stage C in 79% and Child-Pugh A and BCLC Stage B in 21% of patients. Seventy-five percent (75%) of patients had radiographic evidence of cirrhosis at baseline. Investigator-documented primary risk factors for the development of HCC were hepatitis B (50%), hepatitis C (23%), alcohol use (6%), other (7%), and unknown (14%). REFLECT demonstrated that LENVIMA was non-inferior to sorafenib for OS. REFLECT did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients randomized to LENVIMA as compared to those in the sorafenib arm. LENVIMA was statistically significantly superior to sorafenib for PFS and ORR. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 4.

Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in REFLECT 14.4 Endometrial Carcinoma (EC) The efficacy of LENVIMA in combination with pembrolizumab was investigated in Study 111 (NCT02501096), a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort trial that enrolled 108 patients with metastatic endometrial carcinoma that had progressed following at least one prior systemic therapy in any setting. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients were treated with LENVIMA 20 mg orally once daily in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg administered intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression as determined by the investigator. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by independent radiologic review committee (IRC) using RECIST 1.1. Administration of LENVIMA and pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. Pembrolizumab was continued for a maximum of 24 months; however, treatment with LENVIMA could be continued beyond 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline and then every 6 weeks until week 24, followed by every 9 weeks thereafter. Among the 108 patients, 87% (n= 94) had tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR; 10% (n=11) had tumors that were MSI-H or dMMR; and in 3% (n=3) the status was not known. Tumor MSI status was determined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Tumor MMR status was determined using an immunohistochemistry (IHC) test. The baseline characteristics of the 94 patients with tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR were: median age of 66 years with 62% 65 years or older; 86% White, 6% Black, 4% Asian, 3% other races; and ECOG PS of 0 (52%) or 1 (48%). All 94 of these patients received prior systemic therapy for endometrial carcinoma: 51% had one, 38% had two, and 11% had three or more prior systemic therapies. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 14.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Lenvatinib is a kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib also exhibited antiproliferative activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines dependent on activated FGFR signaling with a concurrent inhibition of FGF-receptor substrate 2α (FRS2α) phosphorylation. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, lenvatinib decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone. The combination of lenvatinib and everolimus showed increased antiangiogenic and antitumor activity as demonstrated by decreases in human endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signaling in vitro, and by decreases in tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer that were greater than those with either drug alone. 12. 3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with solid tumors administered single and multiple doses of LENVIMA once daily, the maximum lenvatinib plasma concentration (C max ) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased proportionally over the dose range of 3.2 mg (0.1 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg) to 32 mg (1.33 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg) with a median accumulation index of 0.96 (20 mg) to 1.54 (6.4 mg). Absorption The time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) typically occurred from 1 to 4 hours post-dose. Food Effect Administration with a high fat meal (approximately 900 calories of which approximately 55% were from fat, 15% from protein, and 30% from carbohydrates) did not affect the extent of absorption, but decreased the rate of absorption and delayed the median T max from 2 hours to 4 hours. Distribution In vitro binding of lenvatinib to human plasma proteins ranged from 98% to 99% at concentrations of 0.3 to 30 μg/mL. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.59 to 0.61 at concentrations of 0.1 to 10 μg/mL in vitro. Elimination The terminal elimination half-life of lenvatinib was approximately 28 hours. Metabolism The main metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in humans were identified as enzymatic (CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase) and non-enzymatic processes. Excretion Ten days after a single administration of radiolabeled lenvatinib, approximately 64% and 25% of the radiolabel were eliminated in the feces and urine, respectively. Specific Populations Age, sex, and race did not have a significant effect on apparent oral clearance (CL/F). Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 24 mg dose were evaluated in subjects with mild (CLcr 60-89 mL/min), moderate (CLcr 30-59 mL/min), or severe (CLcr <30 mL/min) renal impairment, and compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with end stage renal disease were not studied. The AUC 0-inf for subjects with renal impairment were similar compared to those for healthy subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 10 mg dose were evaluated in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of a single 5 mg dose were evaluated in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, the dose-adjusted AUC 0-inf of lenvatinib for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were 119%, 107%, and 180%, respectively. Apparent oral clearance of lenvatinib in patients with HCC and mild hepatic impairment was similar to patients with HCC and moderate hepatic impairment. Tumor Patients with HCC in REFLECT had a 13% lower lenvatinib CL/F than patients with other cancer types. Body Weight Lenvatinib exposures in patients with HCC in REFLECT were comparable between those weighing <60 kg who received a starting dose of 8 mg and those ≥60 kg who received a starting dose of 12 mg. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Lenvatinib CYP3A, P-gp, and BCRP Inhibitor s : Ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 18 days) increased lenvatinib (administered as a single 5 mg dose on Day 5) AUC by 15% and C max by 19%. P-gp Inhibitor : Rifampicin (600 mg as a single dose) increased lenvatinib (24 mg as a single dose) AUC by 31% and C max by 33%. CYP3A and P-gp Inducers : Rifampicin (600 mg daily for 21 days) decreased lenvatinib (24 mg as a single dose on Day 15) AUC by 18%. The C max was unchanged. In Vitro Studies with Transporters: Lenvatinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP but not a substrate for organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) 1, MATE2-K, or the bile salt export pump (BSEP). Effect of Lenvatinib on Other Drugs Clinical Studies with Substrates of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8: There is no projected significant drug-drug interaction risk between lenvatinib and midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) or repaglinide (a CYP2C8 substrate). In Vitro Studies with Substrates of CYP or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): Lenvatinib inhibits CYP2C8, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Lenvatinib does not inhibit CYP2A6 and CYP2E1. Lenvatinib induces CYP3A, but it does not induce CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9. Lenvatinib inhibits UGT1A1, UGT1A4, and UGT1A9 in vitro, but likely only inhibits UGT1A1 in vivo in the gastrointestinal tract based on the expression of the enzyme in tissues. Lenvatinib does not inhibit UGT1A6, UGT2B7 or aldehyde oxidase. Lenvatinib does not induce UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. In Vitro Studies with Substrates of Transporter s : Lenvatinib does not have the potential to inhibit MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, BSEP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3 in vivo."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of F ertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with lenvatinib. Lenvatinib mesylate was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay. Lenvatinib was not clastogenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay or the in vivo rat micronucleus assay. No specific studies with lenvatinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility; however, results from general toxicology studies in rats, monkeys, and dogs suggest there is a potential for lenvatinib to impair fertility. Male dogs exhibited testicular hypocellularity of the seminiferous epithelium and desquamated seminiferous epithelial cells in the epididymides at lenvatinib exposures approximately 0.02 to 0.09 times the AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg once daily. Follicular atresia of the ovaries was observed in monkeys and rats at exposures 0.2 to 0.8 times and 10 to 44 times the AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg once daily, respectively. In addition, in monkeys, a decreased incidence of menstruation was reported at lenvatinib exposures lower than those observed in humans at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg once daily."
