        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions ( 5.1 ) Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction, and solid organ transplant rejection. Monitor for early identification and management. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity and type of reaction. Infusion-Related Reactions : Interrupt, slow the rate of infusion, or permanently discontinue based on severity of infusion reactions. ( 5.2 ) Complications of Allogeneic HSCT: Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions TECENTRIQ is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. In general, if TECENTRIQ requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis TECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. TECENTRIQ as a Single Agent: Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3% (83/2616) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ as a single agent, including fatal (<0.1%), Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (0.8%), and Grade 2 (1.1%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 0.5% and withholding of TECENTRIQ in 1.5% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 55% (46/83) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 69% of the 83 patients. Of the 39 patients in whom TECENTRIQ was withheld for pneumonitis, 25 reinitiated TECENTRIQ after symptom improvement; of these, 4% had recurrence of pneumonitis. In IMpower010 immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.8% (19/495) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ as a single agent, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.2%), and Grade 3 (0.6%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 2.2% and withholding of TECENTRIQ in 0.8% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 63% (12/19) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 84% of the 19 patients. TECENTRIQ in Combination with Cobimetinib and Vemurafenib: Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 13% (29/230) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib, including Grade 3 (1.3%) and Grade 2 (7%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 2.6% and withholding of TECENTRIQ in 7.4% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 55% (16/29) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 97% of the 29 patients. Of the 17 patients in whom TECENTRIQ was withheld for pneumonitis, 10 reinitiated TECENTRIQ after symptom improvement; of these, 50% had recurrence of pneumonitis. Immune-Mediated Colitis TECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis can present with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. TECENTRIQ as a Single Agent: Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1% (26/2616) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ as a single agent, including Grade 3 (0.5%) and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 0.2% and withholding of TECENTRIQ in 0.5% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 50% (13/26) of patients with colitis. Colitis resolved in 73% of the 26 patients. Of the 12 patients in whom TECENTRIQ was withheld for colitis, 8 reinitiated treatment with TECENTRIQ after symptom improvement; of these, 25% had recurrence of colitis. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis TECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.8% (48/2616) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ as a single agent, including fatal (<0.1%), Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (0.5%), and Grade 2 (0.5%) adverse reactions. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 0.2% and withholding of TECENTRIQ in 0.2% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 25% (12/48) of patients with hepatitis.

Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 2.2% and withholding of TECENTRIQ in 1.7% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 50% (7/14) of patients with hepatitis. Hepatitis resolved in 93% of the 14 patients. Of the 4 patients in whom TECENTRIQ was withheld for hepatitis, 3 reinitiated TECENTRIQ after symptom improvement; of these, 33% had recurrence of hepatitis. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency TECENTRIQ can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.4% (11/2616) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ as a single agent, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in one patient and withholding of TECENTRIQ in one patient. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 82% (9/11) of patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, 3 patients remained on systemic corticosteroids. The single patient in whom TECENTRIQ was withheld for adrenal insufficiency did not reinitiate TECENTRIQ. In IMpower010 immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1.2% (6/495) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ as a single agent, including Grade 3 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 0.6% and withholding of TECENTRIQ in 0.2% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 83% (5/6) of patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, 4 patients remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis TECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field cuts. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Hypophysitis occurred in <0.1% (2/2616) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ as a single agent, including Grade 2 (1 patient, <0.1%) adverse reactions. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in one patient and no patients required withholding of TECENTRIQ. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 50% (1/2) of patients with hypophysitis. Hypophysitis did not resolve in these 2 patients. Thyroid disorders TECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or medical management for hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Thyroiditis: Thyroiditis occurred in 0.2% (4/2616) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ as a single agent, including Grade 2 (<0.1%) adverse reactions.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in 0.3% (7/2616) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ, including Grade 3 (0.2%) and Grade 2 (<0.1%) adverse reactions. Type 1 diabetes mellitus led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in one patient and withholding of TECENTRIQ in two patients. Treatment with insulin was required for all patients with confirmed Type 1 diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy was continued long-term. Of the 2 patients in whom TECENTRIQ was withheld for Type 1 diabetes mellitus, both re-initiated TECENTRIQ treatment. Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction TECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated nephritis. TECENTRIQ as a Single Agent: Immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction occurred in <0.1% (1/2616) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ as a single agent, and this adverse reaction was a Grade 3 (<0.1%) adverse reaction. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in this patient. This patient required systemic corticosteroids. In this patient, nephritis did not resolve. TECENTRIQ in Combination with Cobimetinib and Vemurafenib: Immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction occurred in 1.3% (3/230) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib, including Grade 2 (1.3%) adverse reactions.

Nephritis resolved in all 3 of these patients. Of the 2 patients in whom TECENTRIQ was withheld for nephritis, both reinitiated TECENTRIQ after symptom improvement and neither had recurrence of nephritis. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions TECENTRIQ can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), DRESS, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), has occurred with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 0.6% (15/2616) of patients receiving TECENTRIQ as a single agent, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. Dermatologic adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of TECENTRIQ in 0.1% and withholding of TECENTRIQ in 0.2% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 20% (3/15) of patients with dermatologic adverse reactions. Dermatologic adverse reactions resolved in 87% of the 15 patients. Of the 4 patients in whom TECENTRIQ was withheld for immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, none re-initiated TECENTRIQ. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of < 1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received TECENTRIQ or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular : Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis. Nervous System : Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy. Ocular : Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue : Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic. Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism. Other (Hematologic/Immune) : Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions TECENTRIQ can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt, slow the rate of, or permanently discontinue TECENTRIQ based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . For Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions, consider using pre-medications with subsequent doses. In clinical studies enrolling 2616 patients with various cancers who received TECENTRIQ as a single-agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , infusion-related reactions occurred in 1.3% of patients, including Grade 3 (0.2%). The frequency and severity of infusion-related reactions were similar whether TECENTRIQ was given as a single-agent in patients with various cancers, in combination with other antineoplastic drugs in NSCLC and SCLC, and across the recommended dose range (840 mg Q2W to 1680 mg Q4W). 5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockage and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefits versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, TECENTRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of TECENTRIQ in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-related rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TECENTRIQ. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TECENTRIQ and for at least 5 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ as a single-agent in 2616 patients in two randomized, active-controlled studies (POPLAR, OAK) and four open-label, single arm studies (PCD4989g, IMvigor210, BIRCH, FIR) which enrolled 524 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, 1636 patients with metastatic NSCLC, and 456 patients with other tumor types. TECENTRIQ was administered at a dose of 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in all studies except PCD4989g. Among the 2616 patients who received a single-agent TECENTRIQ, 36% were exposed for longer than 6 months and 20% were exposed for longer than 12 months. Using the dataset described for patients who received TECENTRIQ as a single-agent, the most common adverse reactions in ≥ 20% of patients were fatigue/asthenia (48%), decreased appetite (25%), nausea (24%), cough (22%), and dyspnea (22%). In addition, the data reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ as a single agent as adjuvant therapy in 495 patients with early stage NSCLC enrolled in a randomized study (IMpower010). In addition, the data reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ in combination with other antineoplastic drugs in 2421 patients with NSCLC (N = 2223) or SCLC (N = 198) enrolled in five randomized, active-controlled trials, including IMpower150, IMpower130 and IMpower133. Among the 2421 patients, 53% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 6 months and 29% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 12 months. Among the 2421 patients with NSCLC and SCLC who received TECENTRIQ in combination with other antineoplastic drugs, the most common adverse reactions in ≥20% of patients were fatigue/asthenia (49%), nausea (38%), alopecia (35%), constipation (29%), diarrhea (28%) and decreased appetite (27%). The data also reflect exposure to TECENTRIQ administered in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib in 230 patients enrolled in IMspire150. Among the 230 patients, 62% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 6 months and 42% were exposed to TECENTRIQ for longer than 12 months. Urothelial Carcinoma Cisplatin-Ineligible Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma The safety of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in IMvigor210 (Cohort 1), a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial that included 119 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and were either previously untreated or had disease progression at least 12 months after neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients received TECENTRIQ 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until either unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The median duration of exposure was 15 weeks (0 to 87 weeks). Five patients (4.2%) who were treated with TECENTRIQ experienced one of the following events which led to death: sepsis, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, or respiratory distress. One additional patient (0.8%) was experiencing herpetic meningoencephalitis and disease progression at the time of death. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 37% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) were diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and renal failure. TECENTRIQ was discontinued for adverse reactions in 4.2% of patients. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were diarrhea/colitis (1.7%), fatigue (0.8%), hypersensitivity (0.8%), and dyspnea (0.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption occurred in 35% of patients; the most common (≥ 1%) were intestinal obstruction, fatigue, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, infusion-related reaction, cough, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, pyrexia, respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, creatinine increase, decreased appetite, hyponatremia, back pain, pruritus, and venous thromboembolism. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the adverse reactions and Grades 3–4 selected laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients who received TECENTRIQ in IMvigor210 (Cohort 1).

Patients received TECENTRIQ with cobimetinib and vemurafenib (N=230) or placebo with cobimetinib and vemurafenib (n=281). Among the 230 patients who received TECENTRIQ administered with cobimetinib and vemurafenib, the median duration of exposure to TECENTRIQ was 9.2 months (range: 0-30 months) to cobimetinib was 10.0 months (range: 1-31 months) and to vemurafenib was 9.8 months (range: 1-31 months). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients in the TECENTRIQ plus cobimetinib and vemurafenib arm. Adverse reactions leading to death were hepatic failure, fulminant hepatitis, sepsis, septic shock, pneumonia, and cardiac arrest. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients in the TECENTRIQ plus cobimetinib and vemurafenib arm. The most frequent (≥ 2%) serious adverse reactions were hepatotoxicity (7%), pyrexia (6%), pneumonia (4.3%), malignant neoplasms (2.2%), and acute kidney injury (2.2%). Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of TECENTRIQ occurred in 21% of patients in the TECENTRIQ plus cobimetinib and vemurafenib arm. The most frequent (≥ 2%) adverse reactions leading to TECENTRIQ discontinuation were increased ALT (2.2%) and pneumonitis (2.6%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of TECENTRIQ occurred in 68% of patients in the TECENTRIQ plus cobimetinib and vemurafenib arm. The most frequent (≥ 2%) adverse reactions leading to TECENTRIQ interruption were pyrexia (14%), increased ALT (13%), hyperthyroidism (10%), increased AST (10%), increased lipase (9%), increased amylase (7%), pneumonitis (5%), increased CPK (4.3%), diarrhea (3.5%), pneumonia (3.5%), asthenia (3%), rash (3%), influenza (3%), arthralgia (2.6%), fatigue (2.2%), dyspnea (2.2%), cough (2.2%), peripheral edema (2.2%), uveitis (2.2%), bronchitis (2.2%), hypothyroidism (2.2%), and respiratory tract infection (2.2%).

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to atezolizumab in the studies described above with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Among 111 patients in IMvigor210 (Cohort 1), 48% tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA also had decreased systemic atezolizumab exposures. The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions. Among 565 patients with NSCLC in OAK, 30% tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at one or more post-dose time points. The median onset time to ADA formation was 3 weeks. The ability of these binding ADA to neutralize atezolizumab is unknown. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA also had decreased systemic atezolizumab exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Exploratory analyses showed that the subset of patients who were ADA positive by week 4 (21%; 118/560) appeared to have less efficacy (effect on overall survival) as compared to patients who tested negative for treatment-emergent ADA by week 4 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions. Among 487 ADA-evaluable patients with NSCLC who received atezolizumab in IMpower010, 31% (n=152) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points. Among 241 patients in the PD-L1 SP263 ≥1% TC Stage II-IIIA population, 28% (n=67) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA had lower systemic atezolizumab exposure as compared to patients who were ADA-negative [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. There were insufficient numbers of patients and DFS events in the ADA-positive subgroup (19%; 39/207 by week 7) to determine whether ADA alters the efficacy of atezolizumab. The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions. Among 364 ADA-evaluable patients with NSCLC who received TECENTRIQ with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin in IMpower150, 36% (n=132) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points and 83% of these 132 patients tested ADA positive prior to receiving the second dose of atezolizumab. The ability of these binding ADA to neutralize atezolizumab is unknown. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA had lower systemic atezolizumab exposure as compared to patients who were ADA negative [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The presence of ADA did not increase the incidence or severity of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Among 315 ADA-evaluable patients with HCC who received TECENTRIQ and bevacizumab in IMbrave150, 28% (n=88) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points and 66% (58/88) of these 88 patients tested ADA-positive prior to receiving the third dose of TECENTRIQ. The ability of these binding ADA to neutralize atezolizumab is unknown. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA had lower systemic atezolizumab exposure as compared to patients who were ADA-negative [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Exploratory analyses showed that the subset of patients who were ADA-positive by week 6 (20%; 58/288) appeared to have less efficacy (effect on overall survival) as compared to patients who tested negative for treatment-emergent ADA by week 6; [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions. Among 218 ADA-evaluable patients with melanoma who received TECENTRIQ in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib in IMspire150, 13% (n=29) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA at one or more post-dose time points. Patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA had decreased systemic atezolizumab exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. There are insufficient numbers of patients with positive ADA to determine whether ADA alters the efficacy or incidence or severity of adverse reactions."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , TECENTRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of TECENTRIQ in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-related rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death (see Data ) . Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with TECENTRIQ to evaluate its effect on reproduction and fetal development. A literature-based assessment of the effects on reproduction demonstrated that a central function of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to a fetus. Blockage of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to a fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore, potential risks of administering TECENTRIQ during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related to the blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 and PD-L1 knockout mice. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to atezolizumab may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of atezolizumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. As human IgG is excreted in human milk, the potential for absorption and harm to the infant is unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from TECENTRIQ, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 5 months after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TECENTRIQ [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception Females Based on its mechanism of action, TECENTRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TECENTRIQ and for at least 5 months following the last dose. Infertility Females Based on animal studies, TECENTRIQ may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential while receiving treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TECENTRIQ have not been established in pediatric patients. The safety and antitumor activity of TECENTRIQ were assessed but not established in a single-arm, multi-center, multi-cohort trial (NCT02541604) in 60 pediatric patients aged 7 months to <17 years with relapsed or progressive solid tumors and lymphomas. No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in this study. In pediatric patients who received TECENTRIQ 15 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 1200 mg every 3 weeks, the steady-state exposure (AUC) of atezolizumab in pediatric patients aged 12 years or older was comparable to that in adult patients who received TECENTRIQ 1200 mg every 3 weeks, while the exposure trended lower in pediatric patients less than 12 years old. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 2616 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, metastatic NSCLC, and other tumor types treated with single agent TECENTRIQ in clinical studies, 49% were 65 years and over and 15% were 75 years and over. Of 2421 patients with NSCLC and SCLC treated with TECENTRIQ in combination with other antineoplastic drugs in clinical studies, 48% were 65 years and over and 10% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients aged 65 years or older and younger patients."

        "11 DESCRIPTION Atezolizumab is a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody. Atezolizumab is an Fc-engineered, humanized, non-glycosylated IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin that has a calculated molecular mass of 145 kDa. TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) injection for intravenous use is a sterile, preservative-free, colorless to slightly yellow solution in single-dose vials. Each 20 mL vial contains 1200 mg of atezolizumab and is formulated in glacial acetic acid (16.5 mg), L-histidine (62 mg), polysorbate 20 (8 mg), and sucrose (821.6 mg), with a pH of 5.8. Each 14 mL vial contains 840 mg of atezolizumab and is formulated in glacial acetic acid (11.5 mg), L-histidine (43.4 mg), polysorbate 20 (5.6 mg), and sucrose (575.1 mg) with a pH of 5.8."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action PD-L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and/or tumor infiltrating immune cells and can contribute to the inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T cells and antigen presenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD - L1 and blocks its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. This releases the PD-L1/PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response, including activation of the anti-tumor immune response without inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD - L1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth. In mouse models of cancer, dual inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 and MAPK pathways suppresses tumor growth and improves tumor immunogenicity through increased antigen presentation and T cell infiltration and activation compared to targeted therapy alone. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Patients' exposure to atezolizumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, including a dose of 1200 mg administered every 3 weeks. The clearance (CV%) was 0.20 L/day (29%), the volume of distribution at steady state was 6.9 L, and the terminal half-life was 27 days. Steady state was achieved after 6 to 9 weeks following multiple doses. The systemic accumulation ratio for every 2 weeks administration and every 3 weeks administration was 3.3- and 1.9- fold, respectively. Atezolizumab clearance was found to decrease over time, with a mean maximal reduction (CV%) from baseline value of approximately 17% (41%); however, the decrease in clearance was not considered clinically relevant. Specific Populations Age (21 to 89 years), body weight, sex, albumin levels, tumor burden, region or race, mild or moderate renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ], mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST), moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin >1.5 to 3× ULN and any AST), level of PD-L1 expression, or performance status had no clinically significant effect on the systemic exposure of atezolizumab. Across clinical trials with TECENTRIQ, median atezolizumab clearance in patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was 19% (range: 18% to 49%) higher as compared to atezolizumab clearance in patients who tested negative for treatment-emergent ADA.

Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with atezolizumab; however, an assessment of the male and female reproductive organs was included in a 26-week, repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. Weekly administration of atezolizumab to female monkeys at the highest dose tested caused an irregular menstrual cycle pattern and a lack of newly formed corpora lutea in the ovaries. This effect occurred at an estimated AUC approximately 6 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose and was reversible. There was no effect on the male monkey reproductive organs. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal models, inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling increased the severity of some infections and enhanced inflammatory responses. M. tuberculosis-infected PD-1 knockout mice exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type controls, which correlated with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory responses in these animals.

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Urothelial Carcinoma Cisplatin-Ineligible Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma The efficacy of TECENTRIQ was investigated in IMvigor210 (Cohort 1) (NCT02951767), a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial that included 119 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and were either previously untreated or had disease progression at least 12 months after neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were considered cisplatin-ineligible if they met any one of the following criteria at study entry: impaired renal function [creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 30 to 59 mL/min], Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2, hearing loss of ≥ 25 decibels (dB) at two contiguous frequencies, or Grades 2-4 peripheral neuropathy. This study excluded patients who had: a history of autoimmune disease; active or corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases; administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to enrollment; or administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 6 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients received TECENTRIQ 1200 mg as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor response assessments were conducted every 9 weeks for the first 54 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. Major efficacy outcome measures included confirmed overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by independent review facility (IRF) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), duration of response (DoR) and overall survival (OS). In this study, the median age was 73 years, 81% were male, and 91% were White. Thirty-five percent of patients had non-bladder urothelial carcinoma and 66% had visceral metastases. Eighty percent of patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Reasons for ineligibility for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy were: 70% had impaired renal function, 20% had an ECOG PS of 2, 14% had a hearing loss of ≥ 25dB, and 6% had Grades 2-4 peripheral neuropathy at baseline. Twenty percent of patients had disease progression following prior platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Tumor specimens were evaluated prospectively using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay at a central laboratory, and the results were used to define subgroups for pre-specified analyses. Of the 119 patients, 27% were classified as having PD-L1 expression of ≥ 5% (defined as PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells [IC] covering ≥ 5% of the tumor area). The remaining 73% of patients were classified as having PD-L1 expression of < 5% (PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating IC covering < 5% of the tumor area). Among the 32 patients with PD-L1 expression of ≥ 5%, median age was 67 years, 81% were male, 19% female, and 88% were White. Twenty-eight percent of patients had non-bladder urothelial carcinoma and 56% had visceral metastases. Seventy-two percent of patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Reasons for ineligibility for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy were: 66% had impaired renal function, 28% had an ECOG PS of 2, 16% had a hearing loss ≥ 25 dB, and 9% had Grades 2-4 peripheral neuropathy at baseline. Thirty-one percent of patients had disease progression following prior platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Confirmed ORR in all patients and the two PD-L1 subgroups are summarized in Table 22 . The median follow-up time for this study was 14.4 months. In 24 patients with disease progression following neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, the ORR was 33% (95% CI: 16%, 55%).

The study contains three arms: TECENTRIQ monotherapy, TECENTRIQ with platinum-based chemotherapy (i.e., cisplatin or carboplatin with gemcitabine), and platinum-based chemotherapy alone (comparator). Both cisplatin-eligible and cisplatin-ineligible patients are included in the study. Tumor specimens were evaluated prospectively using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay at a central laboratory. The independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) for the study conducted a review of early data and found that patients classified as having PD-L1 expression of <5% when treated with TECENTRIQ monotherapy had decreased survival compared to those who received platinum-based chemotherapy. The iDMC recommended closure of the monotherapy arm to further accrual of patients with low PD-L1 expression, however, no other changes were recommended for the study, including any change of therapy for patients who had already been randomized to and were receiving treatment in the monotherapy arm. 14.2 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Adjuvant Treatment of Stage II-IIIA NSCLC with PD-L1 Expression ≥ 1% The efficacy of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in IMpower010 (NCT02486718), a multi-center, randomized, open-label trial for the adjuvant treatment of patients with NSCLC who had complete tumor resection and were eligible to receive cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients were required to have Stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm) – Stage IIIA NSCLC per the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, 7th edition. Patients were excluded if they had a history of autoimmune disease; a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, drug-induced pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active pneumonitis; administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomization; administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomization. A total of 1005 patients who had complete tumor resection and received cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized (1:1) to receive TECENTRIQ 1200 mg intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 16 cycles, unless disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity occurred, or best supportive care (BSC). Randomization was stratified by sex, stage of disease, histology, and PD-L1 expression. Tumor assessments were conducted at baseline of the randomization phase and every 4 months for the first year following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 6 months until year five, then annually thereafter. The median age was 62 years (range: 26 to 84), and 67% of patients were male. The majority of patients were White (73%) and Asian (24%). Most patients were current or previous smokers (78%) and baseline ECOG performance status in patients was 0 (55%) or 1 (44%). Overall, 12% of patients had Stage IB, 47% had Stage II and 41% had Stage IIIA disease. PD-L1 expression, defined as the percentage of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 as measured by the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay, was ≥ 1% in 53% of patients, <1% in 44% and unknown in 2.6%. The primary efficacy outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS) as assessed by the investigator. The primary efficacy analysis population (n = 476) was patients with Stage II – IIIA NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on ≥ 1% of tumor cells (PD-L1 ≥ 1% TC). DFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of occurrence of any of the following: first documented recurrence of disease, new primary NSCLC, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. A key secondary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) in the intent-to-treat population. At the time of the interim DFS analysis, the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in DFS in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% TC, Stage II – IIIA patient population. Efficacy results are presented in Table 23 and Figure 1 . Table 23 Efficacy Results from IMpower010 in Patients with Stage II - IIIA NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% TC Arm A: TECENTRIQ N = 248 Arm B: Best Supportive Care N = 228 CI = Confidence interval, NE = Not estimable, NR = Not reached Disease-Free Survival Number of events (%) 88 (35) 105 (46) Median, months NR 35.3 (95% CI) (36.1, NE) (29.0, NE) Hazard ratio Stratified by stage, sex, and histology (95% CI) 0.66 (0.50, 0.88) p-value 0.004 In a pre-specified secondary subgroup analysis of patients with PD-L1 TC ≥ 50% Stage II – IIIA NSCLC (n=229), the median DFS was not reached (95% CI: 42.3 months, NE) for patients in the TECENTRIQ arm and was 35.7 months (95% CI: 29.7, NE) for patients in the best supportive care arm, with a HR of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.68). In an exploratory subgroup analysis of patients with PD-L1 TC 1-49% Stage II – IIIA NSCLC (n=247), the median DFS was 32.8 months (95% CI: 29.4, NE) for patients in the TECENTRIQ arm and 31.4 months (95% CI: 24.0, NE) for patients in the best supportive care arm, with a HR of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.26). Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Disease-Free Survival in IMpower010 in Patients with Stage II – IIIA NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% TC At the time of the DFS interim analysis, 19% of patients in the PD-L1 ≥1% TC Stage II – IIIA patient population had died. An exploratory analysis of OS in this population resulted in a stratified HR of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.17). Figure 1 Metastatic Chemotherapy-Naïve NSCLC with High PD-L1 Expression The efficacy of TECENTRIQ was evaluated in IMpower110 (NCT02409342), a multicenter, international, randomized, open-label trial in patients with stage IV NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (PD-L1 stained ≥ 1% of tumor cells [TC ≥ 1%] or PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells [IC] covering ≥ 1% of the tumor area [IC ≥ 1%]), who had received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. PD-L1 tumor status was determined based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay. The evaluation of efficacy is based on the subgroup of patients with high PD-L1 expression (TC ≥ 50% or IC ≥ 10%), excluding those with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The trial excluded patients with a history of autoimmune disease, administration of a live attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomization, active or untreated CNS metastases, administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomization. Randomization was stratified by sex, ECOG performance status, histology (non-squamous vs. squamous) and PD-L1 expression (TC ≥ 1% and any IC vs. TC < 1% and IC ≥ 1%). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive one of the following treatment arms: Arm A: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Arm B: Platinum-based chemotherapy Arm B platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for non-squamous NSCLC consisted of cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 ) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2 ) OR carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2 ) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles followed by pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2 ) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm B platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for squamous NSCLC consisted of cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 ) on Day 1 with gemcitabine (1250 mg/m 2 ) on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle OR carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min) on Day 1 with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m 2 ) on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles followed by best supportive care until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of TECENTRIQ was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression. Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks thereafter. Tumor specimens were evaluated prospectively using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay at a central laboratory and the results were used to define subgroups for pre-specified analyses. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) sequentially tested in the following subgroups of patients, excluding those with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations: TC ≥50% or IC ≥10%; TC ≥5% or IC ≥5%; and TC ≥1% or IC ≥1%. Among the 205 chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage IV NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression (TC ≥ 50% or IC ≥ 10%) excluding those with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, the median age was 65.0 years (range: 33 to 87), and 70% of patients were male. The majority of patients were White (82%) and Asian (17%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (36%) or 1 (64%); 88% were current or previous smokers; and 76% of patients had non-squamous disease while 24% of patients had squamous disease. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients with high PD-L1 expression (TC ≥50% or IC ≥10%) at the time of the OS interim analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in OS for the other two PD-L1 subgroups (TC ≥5% or IC ≥5%; and TC ≥1% or IC ≥1%) at the interim or final analyses. Efficacy results for patients with NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression are presented in Table 24 and Figure 2 . Table 24: Efficacy Results from IMpower110 in Patients with NSCLC with High PD-L1 Expression (TC ≥ 50% or IC ≥ 10%) and without EGFR or ALK Genomic Tumor Aberrations Arm A: TECENTRIQ N = 107 Arm B: Platinum-Based Chemotherapy N = 98 CI=confidence interval; NE=not estimable Overall Survival Based on OS interim analysis. The median survival follow-up time in patients was 15.7 months. Deaths (%) 44 (41%) 57 (58%) Median, months 20.2 13.1 (95% CI) (16.5, NE) (7.4, 16.5) Hazard ratio Stratified by sex and ECOG performance status (95% CI) 0.59 (0.40, 0.89) p-value Based on the stratified log-rank test compared to Arm A 0.0106 Compared to the allocated alpha of 0.0413 (two-sided) for this interim analysis. Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival in IMpower110 in Patients with NSCLC with High PD-L1 Expression (TC ≥ 50% or IC ≥ 10%) and without EGFR or ALK Genomic Tumor Aberrations Investigator-assessed PFS showed an HR of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.88), with median PFS of 8.1 months (95% CI: 6.8, 11.0) in the TECENTRIQ arm and 5 months (95% CI: 4.2, 5.7) in the platinum-based chemotherapy arm. The investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 38% (95% CI: 29%, 48%) in the TECENTRIQ arm and 29% (95% CI: 20%, 39%) in the platinum-based chemotherapy arm. Figure 2 Metastatic Chemotherapy-Naive Non-Squamous NSCLC IMpower150 The efficacy of TECENTRIQ with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin was evaluated in IMpower150 (NCT02366143), a multicenter, international, randomized (1:1:1), open-label trial in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC who had received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease but could have received prior EGFR or ALK kinase inhibitor if appropriate, regardless of PD-L1 or T-effector gene (tGE) status and ECOG performance status 0 or 1 were eligible. The trial excluded patients with a history of autoimmune disease, administration of a live attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomization, active or untreated CNS metastases, administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomization, or clear tumor infiltration into the thoracic great vessels or clear cavitation of pulmonary lesions as seen on imaging. Randomization was stratified by sex, presence of liver metastases, and PD-L1 expression status on tumor cells (TC) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) as follows: TC3 and any IC vs. TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 vs. TC0/1/2 and IC0/1. Patients were randomized to one of the following three treatment arms: Arm A: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg, paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 or 200 mg/m 2 and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles Arm B: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 or 200 mg/m 2 , and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles Arm C: bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 or 200 mg/m 2 , and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles Patients who had not experienced disease progression following the completion or cessation of platinum-based chemotherapy, received: Arm A: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Arm B: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Arm C: bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks thereafter. Tumor specimens were evaluated prior to randomization for PD-L1 tumor expression using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) assay at a central laboratory. Tumor tissue was collected at baseline for expression of tGE signature and evaluation was performed using a clinical trial assay in a central laboratory prior to the analysis of efficacy outcome measures. Major efficacy outcome measures for comparison of Arms B and C were progression free survival (PFS) by RECIST v1.1 in the tGE-WT (patients with high expression of T-effector gene signature [tGE], excluding those with EGFR- and ALK-positive NSCLC [WT]) and in the ITT-WT subpopulations and overall survival (OS) in the ITT-WT subpopulation. Additional efficacy outcome measures for comparison of Arms B and C or Arms A and C were PFS and OS in the ITT population, OS in the tGE-WT subpopulation, and ORR/DoR in the tGE-WT and ITT-WT subpopulations. A total of 1202 patients were enrolled across the three arms of whom 1045 were in the ITT-WT subpopulation and 447 were in the tGE-WT subpopulation. The demographic information is limited to the 800 patients enrolled in Arms B and C where efficacy has been demonstrated. The median age was 63 years (range: 31 to 90), and 60% of patients were male. The majority of patients were White (82%), 13% of patients were Asian, 10% were Hispanic, and 2% of patients were Black. Clinical sites in Asia (enrolling 13% of the study population) received paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m 2 while the remaining 87% received paclitaxel at a dose of 200 mg/m 2 . Approximately 14% of patients had liver metastases at baseline, and most patients were current or previous smokers (80%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (43%) or 1 (57%). PD-L1 was TC3 and any IC in 12%, TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 in 13%, and TC0/1/2 and IC0/1 in 75%. The demographics for the 696 patients in the ITT-WT subpopulation were similar to the ITT population except for the absence of patients with EGFR- or ALK- positive NSCLC. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS between Arms B and C in both the tGE-WT and ITT-WT subpopulations, but did not demonstrate a significant difference for either subpopulation between Arms A and C based on the final PFS analyses. In the interim analysis of OS, a statistically significant improvement was observed for Arm B compared to Arm C, but not for Arm A compared to Arm C. Efficacy results for the ITT-WT subpopulation are presented in Table 25 and Figure 3 . Table 25: Efficacy Results in ITT-WT Population in IMpower150 Arm C: Bevacizumab, Paclitaxel and Carboplatin Arm B: TECENTRIQ with Bevacizumab, Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin Arm A: TECENTRIQ with Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin N = 337 N = 359 N = 349 CI=confidence interval Overall Survival Based on OS interim analysis Deaths (%) 197 (59%) 179 (50%) 179 (51%) Median, months 14.7 19.2 19.4 (95% CI) (13.3, 16.9) (17.0, 23.8) (15.7, 21.3) Hazard ratio Stratified by sex, presence of liver metastases, and PD-L1 expression status on TC and IC (95% CI) --- 0.78 (0.64, 0.96) 0.84 (0.72, 1.08) p-value Based on the stratified log-rank test compared to Arm C --- 0.016 Compared to the allocated α=0.0174 (two sided) for this interim analysis 0.204 Compared to the allocated α=0.0128 (two sided) for this interim analysis Progression-Free Survival As determined by independent review facility (IRF) per RECIST v1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1) Number of events (%) 247 (73%) 247 (69%) 245 (70%) Median, months 7.0 8.5 6.7 (95% CI) (6.3, 7.9) (7.3, 9.7) (5.6, 6.9) Hazard ratio (95% CI) --- 0.71 (0.59, 0.85) 0.94 (0.79, 1.13) p-value --- 0.0002 Compared to the allocated α=0.006 (two sided) for the final PFS analysis 0.5219 Objective Response Rate Number of responders (%) 142 (42%) 196 (55%) 150 (43%) (95% CI) (37, 48) (49, 60) (38, 48) Complete Response 3 (1%) 14 (4%) 9 (3%) Partial Response 139 (41%) 182 (51%) 141 (40%) Duration of Response n = 142 n = 196 n = 150 Median, months 6.5 10.8 9.5 (95% CI) (5.6, 7.6) (8.4, 13.9) (7.0, 13.0) Figure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in ITT-WT Population in IMpower150 Exploratory analyses showed that the subset of patients in the four drug regimen arm who were ADA positive by week 4 (30%) appeared to have similar efficacy (effect on overall survival) as compared to patients who tested negative for treatment-emergent ADA by week 4 (70%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In an exploratory analysis, propensity score matching was conducted to compare ADA positive patients in the TECENTRIQ, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm with a matched population in the bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm. Similarly ADA negative patients in the TECENTRIQ, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm were compared with a matched population in the bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin arm. Propensity score matching factors were: baseline sum of longest tumor size (BSLD), baseline ECOG, baseline albumin, baseline LDH, sex, tobacco history, metastatic site, TC level, and IC level. The hazard ratio comparing the ADA-positive subgroup with its matched control was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.07). The hazard ratio comparing the ADA-negative subgroup with its matched control was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.90). Figure 3 IMpower130 The efficacy of TECENTRIQ with paclitaxel protein-bound and carboplatin was evaluated in IMpower130 (NCT02367781), a multicenter, randomized (2:1), open-label trial in patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. Patients with Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC who had received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, but could have received prior EGFR or ALK kinase inhibitor, if appropriate, were eligible. The trial excluded patients with history of autoimmune disease, administration of live attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomization, administration of immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomization, and active or untreated CNS metastases. Randomization was stratified by sex, presence of liver metastases, and PD-L1 tumor expression according to the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) assay as follows: TC3 and any IC vs. TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 vs. TC0/1/2 and IC0/1. Patients were randomized to one of the following treatment regimens: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg on Day 1, paclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles followed by TECENTRIQ 1200 mg once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or Paclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 or 6 cycles followed by best supportive care or pemetrexed. Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks, then every 9 weeks thereafter. Major efficacy outcome measures were PFS by RECIST v1.1 and OS in the subpopulation of patients evaluated for and documented to have no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations (ITT-WT). A total of 724 patients were enrolled; of these, 681 (94%) were in the ITT-WT population. The median age was 64 years (range: 18 to 86) and 59% were male. The majority of patients were white (90%), 2% of patients were Asian, 5% were Hispanic, and 4% were Black. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (41%) or 1 (58%). Most patients were current or previous smokers (90%). PD-L1 tumor expression was TC0/1/2 and IC0/1 in 73%; TC3 and any IC in 14%; and TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 in 13%. Efficacy results for the ITT-WT population are presented in Table 26 and Figure 4 .

Patients with a history of autoimmune disease, symptomatic or corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases, or requiring systemic immunosuppression within 2 weeks prior to enrollment were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by PD-L1 expression tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC), the number of prior chemotherapy regimens (1 vs. 2), and histology (squamous vs. non-squamous). Patients were randomized to receive TECENTRIQ 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity, radiographic progression, or clinical progression or docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 36 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter. Major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) in the first 850 randomized patients and OS in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1-expressing tumors (defined as ≥ 1% PD-L1 expression on tumor cells [TC] or immune cells [IC]). Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS in all randomized patients (n = 1225), OS in subgroups based on PD-L1 expression, overall response rate (ORR), and progression free survival as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v.1.1. Among the first 850 randomized patients, the median age was 64 years (33 to 85 years) and 47% were ≥ 65 years old; 61% were male; 70% were White and 21% were Asian; 15% were current smokers and 67% were former smokers; and 37% had baseline ECOG PS of 0 and 63% had a baseline ECOG PS of 1. Nearly all (94%) had metastatic disease, 74% had non-squamous histology, 75% had received only one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, and 55% of patients had PD-L1-expressing tumors. Efficacy results are presented in Table 27 and Figure 5 .

Of the 850 patients, 16% were classified as having high PD-L1 expression, defined as having PD-L1 expression on ≥ 50% of TC or ≥ 10% of IC. In an exploratory efficacy subgroup analysis of OS based on PD-L1 expression, the hazard ratio was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.64) in the high PD-L1 expression subgroup and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.98) in patients who did not have high PD-L1 expression. Exploratory analyses showed that the subset of patients who were ADA positive by week 4 (21%) appeared to have less efficacy (effect on overall survival) as compared to patients who tested negative for treatment-emergent ADA by week 4 (79%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . ADA positive patients by week 4 appeared to have similar OS compared to docetaxel-treated patients. In an exploratory analysis, propensity score matching was conducted to compare ADA positive patients in the atezolizumab arm with a matched population in the docetaxel arm and ADA negative patients in the atezolizumab arm with a matched population in the docetaxel arm. Propensity score matching factors were: baseline sum of longest tumor size (BSLD), baseline ECOG, histology (squamous vs. non-squamous), baseline albumin, baseline LDH, gender, tobacco history, metastases status (advanced or local), metastatic site, TC level, and IC level. The hazard ratio comparing the ADA positive subgroup with its matched control was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.3). The hazard ratio comparing the ADA negative subgroup with its matched control was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.83). Figure 5 14.3 Small Cell Lung Cancer The efficacy of TECENTRIQ with carboplatin and etoposide was investigated in IMpower133 (NCT02763579), a randomized (1:1), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 403 patients with ES-SCLC. IMpower133 enrolled patients with ES-SCLC who had received no prior chemotherapy for extensive stage disease and ECOG performance status 0 or 1. The trial excluded patients with active or untreated CNS metastases, history of autoimmune disease, administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization, or administration of systemic immunosuppressive medications within 1 week prior to randomization. Randomization was stratified by sex, ECOG performance status, and presence of brain metastases. Patients were randomized to receive one of the following two treatment arms: TECENTRIQ 1200 mg and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min on Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1, 2 and 3 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 cycles followed by TECENTRIQ 1200 mg once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or placebo and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min on Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 cycles followed by placebo once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of TECENTRIQ was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression. Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients treated beyond disease progression had tumor assessment conducted every 6 weeks until treatment discontinuation. Major efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 in the intent-to-treat population. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR and DoR as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1. A total of 403 patients were randomized, including 201 to the TECENTRIQ arm and 202 to the chemotherapy alone arm. The median age was 64 years (range 26 to 90) and 65% were male. The majority of patients were White (80%); 17% were Asian, 4% were Hispanic and 1% were Black. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (35%) or 1 (65%); 9% of patients had a history of brain metastases, and 97% were current or previous smokers. Efficacy results are presented in Table 28 and Figure 6 .

Randomization was stratified by geographic region (Asia excluding Japan vs. rest of world), macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread (presence vs. absence), baseline AFP (<400 vs. ≥400 ng/mL), and by ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1). A total of 501 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either TECENTRIQ as an intravenous infusion of 1200 mg, followed by 15 mg/kg bevacizumab, on the same day every 3 weeks or sorafenib 400 mg given orally twice daily, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients could discontinue either TECENTRIQ or bevacizumab (e.g., due to adverse events) and continue on single-agent therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity associated with the single-agent. The study enrolled patients who were ECOG performance score 0 or 1 and who had not received prior systemic treatment. Patients were required to be evaluated for the presence of varices within 6 months prior to treatment, and were excluded if they had variceal bleeding within 6 months prior to treatment, untreated or incompletely treated varices with bleeding, or high risk of bleeding. Patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis, moderate or severe ascites; history of hepatic encephalopathy; a history of autoimmune disease; administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization; administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomization; or untreated or corticosteroid-dependent brain metastases were excluded. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks for the first 54 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter. The demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the study population were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 65 years (range: 26 to 88) and 83% of patients were male. The majority of patients were Asian (57%) or White (35%); 40% were from Asia (excluding Japan). Approximately 75% of patients presented with macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread and 37% had a baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (62%) or 1 (38%). HCC risk factors were Hepatitis B in 48% of patients, Hepatitis C in 22%, and 31% of patients had non-viral liver disease. The majority of patients had BCLC stage C (82%) disease at baseline, while 16% had stage B, and 3% had stage A. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and independent review facility (IRF)-assessed progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were IRF-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST and mRECIST. Efficacy results are presented in Table 29 and Figure 7 .

ADA-positive patients by week 6 appeared to have similar overall survival compared to sorafenib-treated patients. In an exploratory analysis, inverse probability weighting was conducted to compare ADA-positive patients and ADA-negative patients in the TECENTRIQ and bevacizumab arm to the sorafenib arm. Inverse probability weighting factors were: baseline sum of longest tumor size (BSLD), baseline ECOG, baseline albumin, baseline LDH, sex, age, race, geographic region, weight, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, AFP (<400 ng/mL vs ≥400 ng/mL), number of metastatic sites, MVI and/or EHS present at study entry, etiology (HBV vs. HCV vs. non-viral) and Child-Pugh Score (A5 vs. A6). The OS hazard ratio comparing the ADA-positive subgroup of the TECENTRIQ and bevacizumab arm to sorafenib was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.53). The OS hazard ratio comparing the ADA-negative subgroup to sorafenib was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.60). Figure 7 14.5 Melanoma The efficacy of TECENTRIQ in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (IMspire150; NCT02908672) conducted in 514 patients. Randomization was stratified by geographic location (North America vs. Europe vs. Australia, New Zealand, and others) and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [less than or equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) vs. greater than ULN]. Eligible patients were required to have previously untreated unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma as detected by a locally available test and centrally confirmed with the FoundationOne™ assay. Patients were excluded if they had history of autoimmune disease; administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to randomization; administration of systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks prior to randomization; and active or untreated CNS metastases. TECENTRIQ was initiated after patients received a 28-day treatment cycle of cobimetinib 60 mg orally once daily (21 days on / 7 days off) and vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily Days 1-21 and 720 mg orally twice daily Days 22-28. Patients received TECENTRIQ 840 mg intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks in combination with cobimetinib 60 mg orally once daily and vemurafenib 720 mg orally twice daily, or placebo in combination with cobimetinib 60 mg orally once daily and vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. There was no crossover at the time of disease progression. Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks (± 1 week) for the first 24 months and every 12 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcomes included PFS assessed by an independent central review, investigator-assessed ORR, OS, and DOR. The median age of the study population was 54 years (range: 22-88), 58% of patients were male, 95% were White, a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (77%) or 1 (23%), 33% had elevated LDH, 94% had metastatic disease, 60% were Stage IV (M1C), 56% had less than three metastatic sites at baseline, 3% had prior treatment for brain metastases, 30% had liver metastases at baseline, and 14% had received prior adjuvant systemic therapy. Based on central testing, 74% were identified as having a V600E mutation, 11% as having V600K mutation, and 1% as having V600D or V600R mutations. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 30 and Figure 8 . Patients had a median survival follow up time of 18.9 months.

The median OS was 28.8 months with 93 (36%) deaths in the TECENTRIQ plus cobimetinib and vemurafenib arm, and 25.1 months with 112 (43%) deaths in the placebo plus cobimetinib and vemurafenib arm. The hazard ratio for OS was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.11) and the p-value was 0.2310. Figure 8"
