        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid if possible. If not possible, increase TAGRISSO to 160 mg daily in patients receiving a strong CYP3A4 inducer. (2.4, 7.1) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Osimertinib Strong CYP3A Inducers Co-administering TAGRISSO with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the exposure of osimertinib compared to administering TAGRISSO alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Decreased osimertinib exposure may lead to reduced efficacy. Avoid co-administering TAGRISSO with strong CYP3A inducers. Increase the TAGRISSO dosage when co-administering with a strong CYP3A4 inducer if concurrent use is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. No dose adjustments are required when TAGRISSO is used with moderate and/or weak CYP3A inducers. 7.2 Effect of Osimertinib on Other Drugs Co-administering TAGRISSO with a breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate increased the exposure of the substrate compared to administering it alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increased BCRP or P-gp substrate exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related toxicity. Monitor for adverse reactions of the BCRP or P-gp substrate, unless otherwise instructed in its approved labeling, when coadministered with TAGRISSO. 7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QTc Interval The effect of co-administering medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval with TAGRISSO is unknown. When feasible, avoid concomitant administration of drugs known to prolong the QTc interval with known risk of Torsades de pointes. If not feasible to avoid concomitant administration of such drugs, conduct periodic ECG monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

No overall differences in effectiveness were observed based on age. Exploratory analysis suggests a higher incidence of Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions (13.4% versus 9.3%) and more frequent dose modifications for adverse reactions (13.4% versus 7.6%) in patients 65 years or older as compared to those younger than 65 years."

        "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on an analysis of dose-exposure response relationships over the dose range of 20 mg (0.25 times the recommended dose) to 240 mg (3 times the recommended dose), no apparent relationship between osimertinib exposure and overall response rate, duration of response and progression-free survival was identified; however, there were limited data available at the 20 mg dose. Over the same dose range, increased exposure led to increased probability of adverse reactions, specifically rash, diarrhea and ILD. Cardiac Electrophysiology The QTc interval prolongation potential of osimertinib was assessed in 210 patients who received TAGRISSO 80 mg daily in AURA2. A central tendency analysis of the QTcF data at steady-state demonstrated that the maximum mean change from baseline was 16.2 msec (upper bound of two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) 17.6 msec). A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis in AURA2 suggested a concentration-dependent QTc interval prolongation of 14 msec (upper bound of two-sided 90% CI: 16 msec) at a dose of TAGRISSO 80 mg."

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with osimertinib. Osimertinib did not cause genetic damage in in vitro and in vivo assays. Based on studies in animals, male fertility may be impaired by treatment with TAGRISSO. Degenerative changes were present in the testes in rats and dogs exposed to osimertinib for 1 month or more with evidence of reversibility in the rat. Following administration of osimertinib to rats for approximately 10 weeks at a dose of 40 mg/kg, at exposures 0.5 times the AUC observed at the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg once daily, there was a reduction in male fertility, demonstrated by increased pre-implantation loss in untreated females mated to treated males. Based on studies in animals, female fertility may be impaired by treatment with TAGRISSO. In repeat dose toxicity studies, histological evidence of anestrus, corpora lutea degeneration in the ovaries and epithelial thinning in the uterus and vagina were seen in rats exposed to osimertinib for 1 month or more at exposures 0.3 times the AUC observed at the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg once daily. Findings in the ovaries seen following 1 month of dosing exhibited evidence of reversibility. In a female fertility study in rats, administration of osimertinib from 2 weeks prior to mating through Day 8 of gestation at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the Cmax at the recommended dose of 80 mg once daily) had no effects on oestrus cycling or the number of females becoming pregnant, but caused early embryonic deaths. These findings showed evidence of reversibility when females were mated 1 month after treatment discontinuation."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Osimertinib is a kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which binds irreversibly to certain mutant forms of EGFR (T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletion) at approximately 9-fold lower concentrations than wild-type. Two pharmacologically-active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104 circulating at approximately 10% of the parent) with similar inhibitory profiles to osimertinib have been identified in the plasma after oral administration of osimertinib. AZ7550 showed a similar potency to osimertinib, while AZ5104 showed greater potency against exon 19 deletion and T790M mutants (approximately 8-fold) and wild-type (approximately 15-fold) EGFR. In vitro, osimertinib also inhibited the activity of HER2, HER3, HER4, ACK1, and BLK at clinically relevant concentrations. In cultured cells and animal tumor implantation models, osimertinib exhibited anti-tumor activity against NSCLC lines harboring EGFR-mutations (T790M/L858R, L858R, T790M/exon 19 deletion, and exon 19 deletion) and, to a lesser extent, wild-type EGFR amplifications. Osimertinib distributed to the brain in multiple animal species (monkey, rat, and mouse) with brain to plasma AUC ratios of approximately 2 following oral dosing. These data are consistent with observations of tumor regression and increased survival in osimertinib- versus control-treated animals in a pre-clinical mutant-EGFR intracranial mouse metastasis xenograft model (PC9; exon 19 deletion)."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of osimertinib increased dose proportionally over 20 to 240 mg dose range (i.e., 0.25 to 3 times the recommended dosage) after oral administration and exhibited linear pharmacokinetics (PK). Administration of TAGRISSO orally once daily resulted in approximately 3-fold accumulation with steady-state exposures achieved after 15 days of dosing. At steady state, the Cmax to Cmin (minimal concentration) ratio was 1.6-fold. Absorption The median time to Cmax of osimertinib was 6 hours (range 3-24 hours). Following administration of a 20 mg TAGRISSO tablet with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (containing approximately 58 grams of fat and 1000 calories), the Cmax and AUC of osimertinib were comparable to that under fasting conditions. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss/F) of osimertinib was 918 L. Plasma protein binding of osimertinib was 95%. Elimination Osimertinib plasma concentrations decreased with time and a population estimated mean half-life of osimertinib was 48 hours, and oral clearance (CL/F) was 14.3 (L/h). Metabolism The main metabolic pathways of osimertinib were oxidation (predominantly CYP3A) and dealkylation in vitro. Two pharmacologically active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104) have been identified in the plasma after TAGRISSO oral administration. The geometric mean exposure (AUC) of each metabolite (AZ5104 and AZ7550) was approximately 10% of the exposure of osimertinib at steady-state. Excretion Osimertinib is primarily eliminated in the feces (68%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (14%). Unchanged osimertinib accounted for approximately 2% of the elimination. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib were observed based on age, sex, ethnicity, body weight, baseline albumin, line of therapy, smoking status, renal function (creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≥15 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault), or hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B, or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin between 1 to 3 times ULN and any AST). The pharmacokinetics of osimertinib in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr < 15 mL/min) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 3 to 10 times ULN and any AST) are unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and (8.7)]. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on TAGRISSO in Clinical Pharmacokinetic Studies Strong CYP3A Inducers: The steady-state AUC of osimertinib was reduced by 78% in patients when co-administered with rifampin (600 mg daily for 21 days) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administering TAGRISSO with 200 mg itraconazole twice daily (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of osimertinib (AUC increased by 24% and Cmax decreased by 20%). Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: The exposure of osimertinib was not affected by concurrent administration of a single 80 mg TAGRISSO tablet following 40 mg omeprazole administration for 5 days. Effect of Osimertinib on Other Drugs in Clinical Pharmacokinetic Studies BCRP substrates: Co-administering TAGRISSO with rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate) increased rosuvastatin AUC by 35% and Cmax by 72% [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. P-gp substrates: Co-administering TAGRISSO with fexofenadine (a P-gp substrate) increased fexofenadine AUC and Cmax by 56% and 76% after a single dose and 27% and 25% at steady state, respectively. CYP3A4 substrates: Co-administering TAGRISSO with simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of simvastatin. In Vitro Studies CYP450 Metabolic Pathways: Osimertinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1. Osimertinib induced CYP1A2 enzymes. Transporter Systems: Osimertinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and BCRP and is not a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Osimertinib is an inhibitor of BCRP and does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2K and OCT2."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], TAGRISSO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on TAGRISSO use in pregnant women. Administration of osimertinib to pregnant rats was associated with embryolethality and reduced fetal growth at plasma exposures 1.5 times the exposure at the recommended clinical dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically-recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data When administered to pregnant rats prior to embryonic implantation through the end of organogenesis (gestation days 2-20) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma exposures of approximately 1.5 times the clinical exposure, osimertinib caused post-implantation loss and early embryonic death. When administered to pregnant rats from implantation through the closure of the hard palate (gestation days 6 to 16) at doses of 1 mg/kg/day and above (0.1 times the AUC observed at the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg once daily), an equivocal increase in the rate of fetal malformations and variations was observed in treated litters relative to those of concurrent controls. When administered to pregnant dams at doses of 30 mg/kg/day during organogenesis through lactation Day 6, osimertinib caused an increase in total litter loss and postnatal death. At a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, osimertinib administration during the same period resulted in increased postnatal death as well as a slight reduction in mean pup weight at birth that increased in magnitude between lactation days 4 and 6."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Occurred in 3.9% of patients. Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO in patients diagnosed with ILD/Pneumonitis. (5.1) • QTc Interval Prolongation: Monitor electrocardiograms and electrolytes in patients who have a history or predisposition for QTc prolongation, or those who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QTc interval. Withhold then restart at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue TAGRISSO. (2.4, 5.2) • Cardiomyopathy: Occurred in 2.6% of patients. Conduct cardiac monitoring, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment in patients with cardiac risk factors. (2.4, 5.3) • Keratitis: Promptly refer patients with signs and symptoms of keratitis to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. (5.4) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: TAGRISSO can cause fetal harm. Advise females of potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 6 weeks after final dose. Advise males to use effective contraception for 4 months, after the last dose of TAGRISSO. (5.5, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 3.9% of the 1142 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.4% of cases were fatal. Withhold TAGRISSO and promptly investigate for ILD in patients who present with worsening of respiratory symptoms which may be indicative of ILD (e.g., dyspnea, cough and fever). Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO if ILD is confirmed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.2 QTc Interval Prolongation Heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation occurs in patients treated with TAGRISSO. Of the 1142 patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical trials, 0.9% were found to have a QTc > 500 msec, and 3.6% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc > 60 msec [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. No QTc-related arrhythmias were reported. Clinical trials of TAGRISSO did not enroll patients with baseline QTc of > 470 msec. Conduct periodic monitoring with ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs/symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Cardiomyopathy Across clinical trials, cardiomyopathy (defined as cardiac failure, chronic cardiac failure, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema or decreased ejection fraction) occurred in 2.6% of the 1142 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.1% of cardiomyopathy cases were fatal. A decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 10% from baseline and to less than 50% LVEF occurred in 3.9% of 908 patients who had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment. Conduct cardiac monitoring, including assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment, in patients with cardiac risk factors. Assess LVEF in patients who develop relevant cardiac signs or symptoms during treatment. For symptomatic congestive heart failure, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.4 Keratitis Keratitis was reported in 0.7% of 1142 patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical trials. Promptly refer patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis (such as eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye) to an ophthalmologist. 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, TAGRISSO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, osimertinib caused post-implantation fetal loss when administered during early development at a dose exposure 1.5 times the exposure at the recommended clinical dose. When males were treated prior to mating with untreated females, there was an increase in preimplantation embryonic loss at plasma exposures of approximately 0.5 times those observed at the recommended dose of 80 mg once daily. Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TAGRISSO. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 6 weeks after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception for 4 months after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]."

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage: 80 mg orally once daily, with or without food. (2.2) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for the first-line treatment of metastatic EGFR-positive NSCLC with TAGRISSO based on the presence of EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations in tumor or plasma specimens [see Clinical Studies (14)]. If these mutations are not detected in a plasma specimen, test tumor tissue if feasible. Select patients for the treatment of metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC with TAGRISSO following progression on or after EGFR TKI therapy based on the presence of an EGFR T790M mutation in tumor or plasma specimens [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Testing for the presence of the T790M mutation in plasma specimens is recommended only in patients for whom a tumor biopsy cannot be obtained. If this mutation is not detected in a plasma specimen, re-evaluate the feasibility of biopsy for tumor tissue testing. Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of EGFR mutations is available at http://www.fda.gov/companiondiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Regimen The recommended dosage of TAGRISSO is 80 mg tablet once a day until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. TAGRISSO can be taken with or without food. If a dose of TAGRISSO is missed, do not make up the missed dose and take the next dose as scheduled. 2.3 Administration to Patients Who Have Difficulty Swallowing Solids Disperse tablet in 60 mL (2 ounces) of non-carbonated water only. Stir until tablet is dispersed into small pieces (the tablet will not completely dissolve) and swallow immediately. Do not crush, heat, or ultrasonicate during preparation. Rinse the container with 120 mL to 240 mL (4 to 8 ounces) of water and immediately drink. If administration via nasogastric tube is required, disperse the tablet as above in 15 mL of non-carbonated water, and then use an additional 15 mL of water to transfer any residues to the syringe. The resulting 30 mL liquid should be administered as per the nasogastric tube instructions with appropriate water flushes (approximately 30 mL). 2.4 Dosage Modifications Adverse Reactions Table 1. Recommended Dosage Modifications for TAGRISSO Target Organ Adverse ReactionAdverse reactions graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0). Dosage Modification Pulmonary Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO. Cardiac QTc QTc = QT interval corrected for heart rate interval greater than 500 msec on at least 2 separate ECGs ECGs = Electrocardiograms Withhold TAGRISSO until QTc interval is less than 481 msec or recovery to baseline if baseline QTc is greater than or equal to 481 msec, then resume at 40 mg dose. QTc interval prolongation with signs/symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO. Symptomatic congestive heart failure Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO. Other Adverse reaction of Grade 3 or greater severity Withhold TAGRISSO for up to 3 weeks. If improvement to Grade 0-2 within 3 weeks Resume at 80 mg or 40 mg daily. If no improvement within 3 weeks Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO. Drug Interactions Strong CYP3A4 Inducers If concurrent use is unavoidable, increase TAGRISSO dosage to 160 mg daily when co-administering with a strong CYP3A inducer. Resume TAGRISSO at 80 mg 3 weeks after discontinuation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] QTc Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Keratitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were diarrhea, rash, dry skin, nail toxicity, stomatitis, fatigue and decreased appetite. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or www.TAGRISSO.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to TAGRISSO in 1142 patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who received TAGRISSO at the recommended dose of 80 mg once daily in two randomized, active-controlled trials [FLAURA (n=279) and AURA3 (n=279)], two single arm trials [AURA Extension (n=201) and AURA2 (n=210)], and one dose-finding study, AURA1 (n=173) [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The data described below reflect exposure to TAGRISSO (80 mg daily) in 558 patients with EGFR mutation-positive, metastatic NSCLC in two randomized, active-controlled trials [FLAURA (n=279) and AURA3 (n=279)]. Patients with a history of interstitial lung disease, drug induced interstitial disease or radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, serious arrhythmia or baseline QTc interval greater than 470 msec on electrocardiogram were excluded from enrollment in these studies. Previously Untreated EGFR Mutation-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of TAGRISSO was evaluated in FLAURA, a multicenter international double-blind randomized (1:1) active controlled trial conducted in 556 patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic NSCLC who had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease. The median duration of exposure to TAGRISSO was 16.2 months. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients treated with TAGRISSO were diarrhea (58%), rash (58%), dry skin (36%), nail toxicity (35%), stomatitis (29%), and decreased appetite (20%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 4% of patients treated with TAGRISSO; the most common serious adverse reactions (≥1%) were pneumonia (2.9%), ILD/pneumonitis (2.1%), and pulmonary embolism (1.8%). Dose reductions occurred in 2.9% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reductions or interruptions were prolongation of the QT interval as assessed by ECG (4.3%), diarrhea (2.5%), and lymphopenia (1.1%). Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 13% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of TAGRISSO was ILD/pneumonitis (3.9%). Tables 2 and 3 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities which occurred in FLAURA. FLAURA was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in adverse reaction rates for TAGRISSO, or for the control arm, for any adverse reaction listed in Tables 2 and 3.

A total of 279 patients received TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once daily until intolerance to therapy, disease progression, or investigator determination that the patient was no longer benefiting from treatment. A total of 136 patients received pemetrexed plus either carboplatin or cisplatin every three weeks for up to 6 cycles; patients without disease progression after 4 cycles of chemotherapy could continue maintenance pemetrexed until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or investigator determination that the patient was no longer benefiting from treatment. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) was evaluated at screening and every 12 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 8.1 months for patients treated with TAGRISSO and 4.2 months for chemotherapy-treated patients. The trial population characteristics were: median age 62 years, age less than 65 (58%), female (64%), Asian (65%), never smokers (68%), and ECOG PS 0 or 1 (100%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients treated with TAGRISSO were diarrhea (41%), rash (34%), dry skin (23%), nail toxicity (22%), and fatigue (22%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 18% of patients treated with TAGRISSO and 26% in the chemotherapy group. No single serious adverse reaction was reported in 2% or more patients treated with TAGRISSO. One patient (0.4%) treated with TAGRISSO experienced a fatal adverse reaction (ILD/pneumonitis). Dose reductions occurred in 2.9% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reductions or interruptions were prolongation of the QT interval as assessed by ECG (1.8%), neutropenia (1.1%), and diarrhea (1.1%). Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of TAGRISSO occurred in 7% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of TAGRISSO was ILD/pneumonitis (3%). Tables 4 and 5 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities which occurred in TAGRISSO-treated patients in AURA3.

Administration of osimertinib to pregnant rats was associated with embryolethality and reduced fetal growth at plasma exposures 1.5 times the exposure at the recommended clinical dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically-recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data When administered to pregnant rats prior to embryonic implantation through the end of organogenesis (gestation days 2-20) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma exposures of approximately 1.5 times the clinical exposure, osimertinib caused post-implantation loss and early embryonic death. When administered to pregnant rats from implantation through the closure of the hard palate (gestation days 6 to 16) at doses of 1 mg/kg/day and above (0.1 times the AUC observed at the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg once daily), an equivocal increase in the rate of fetal malformations and variations was observed in treated litters relative to those of concurrent controls. When administered to pregnant dams at doses of 30 mg/kg/day during organogenesis through lactation Day 6, osimertinib caused an increase in total litter loss and postnatal death. At a dose of 20 mg/kg/day, osimertinib administration during the same period resulted in increased postnatal death as well as a slight reduction in mean pup weight at birth that increased in magnitude between lactation days 4 and 6. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of osimertinib or its active metabolites in human milk, the effects of osimertinib on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Administration to rats during gestation and early lactation was associated with adverse effects, including reduced growth rates and neonatal death [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from osimertinib, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 2 weeks after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TAGRISSO. Contraception TAGRISSO can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 6 weeks after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 4 months following the final dose of TAGRISSO [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Infertility Based on animal studies, TAGRISSO may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. The effects on female fertility showed a trend toward reversibility. It is not known whether the effects on male fertility are reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TAGRISSO in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Forty-three percent (43%) of the 1142 patients in FLAURA (n=279), AURA3 (n=279), AURA Extension (n=201), AURA2 (n=210), and AURA1, (n=173) were 65 years of age and older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed based on age. Exploratory analysis suggests a higher incidence of Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions (13.4% versus 9.3%) and more frequent dose modifications for adverse reactions (13.4% versus 7.6%) in patients 65 years or older as compared to those younger than 65 years. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15 - 89 mL/min, as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault. There is no recommended dose of TAGRISSO for patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr < 15 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 to 3 times ULN and any AST).There is no recommended dose for TAGRISSO for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 3 to 10 times ULN and any AST) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Previously Untreated EGFR Mutation-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The efficacy of TAGRISSO was demonstrated in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled trial (FLAURA [NCT02296125]) in patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive, metastatic NSCLC, who had not received previous systemic treatment for metastatic disease. Patients were required to have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, a WHO performance status of 0-1, and EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation in tumor prospectively identified by the cobas® EGFR Mutation Test in a central laboratory or by an investigational assay at a CLIA-certified or accredited laboratory. Patients with CNS metastases not requiring steroids and with stable neurologic status for at least two weeks after completion of definitive surgery or radiotherapy were eligible. Patients were assessed at the investigator’s discretion for CNS metastases if they had a history of, or suspected, CNS metastases at study entry. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once daily or to receive gefitinib 250 mg orally once daily or erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by EGFR mutation type (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation) and ethnicity (Asian or non-Asian). Patients randomized to the control arm were offered TAGRISSO at the time of disease progression if tumor samples tested positive for the EGFR T790M mutation. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by investigator. Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR). A total of 556 patients were randomized to TAGRISSO (n=279) or to control (gefitinib n=183; erlotinib n=94). The median age was 64 years (range 26-93 years); 54% were < 65 years of age; 63% were female; 62% were Asian and 64% were never smokers. Baseline WHO performance status was 0 (41%) or 1 (59%); 5% had Stage IIIb and 95% had Stage IV; and 7% received prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. With regard to EGFR tumor testing, 63% were exon 19 deletion and 37% were exon 21 L858R; 5 patients (<1%) also had a concomitant de novo T790M mutation. EGFR mutation status was confirmed centrally using the cobas EGFR Mutation Test in 90% of patients. Of those randomized to investigator’s choice of erlotinib or gefitinib, 55 patients (20%) received TAGRISSO as the next line of antineoplastic therapy. FLAURA demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to TAGRISSO as compared to erlotinib or gefitinib (see Table 6 and Figure 1). Overall survival data were not mature at the time of the final PFS analysis. Table 6.

All patients were required to have EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC identified by the cobas® EGFR Mutation Test performed in a central laboratory prior to randomization. A total of 419 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive TAGRISSO (n=279) or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (n=140). Randomization was stratified by ethnicity (Asian vs. non-Asian). Patients in the TAGRISSO arm received TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once daily until intolerance to therapy, disease progression, or investigator determination that the patient was no longer benefiting from treatment. Patients in the chemotherapy arm received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with carboplatin AUC5 or pemetrexed 500mg/m2 with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Patients whose disease had not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy could have received pemetrexed maintenance therapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle). The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) by investigator assessment. Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), and overall survival (OS). Patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm who had radiological progression according to both investigator and blinded independent central review (BICR) were permitted to cross over to receive treatment with TAGRISSO. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the overall trial population were: median age 62 years (range: 20-90 years), ≥75 years old (15%), female (64%), White (32%), Asian (65%), never smoker (68%), WHO performance status 0 or 1 (100%). Fifty-four percent (54%) of patients had extra-thoracic visceral metastases, including 34% with central nervous system (CNS) metastases (including 11% with measurable CNS metastases) and 23% with liver metastases. Forty-two percent (42%) of patients had metastatic bone disease. In AURA3, there was a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the patients randomized to TAGRISSO compared to chemotherapy (See Table 8 and Figure 2). Overall survival data were not mature at the time of the PFS analysis. Table 8.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Osimertinib is a kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which binds irreversibly to certain mutant forms of EGFR (T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletion) at approximately 9-fold lower concentrations than wild-type. Two pharmacologically-active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104 circulating at approximately 10% of the parent) with similar inhibitory profiles to osimertinib have been identified in the plasma after oral administration of osimertinib. AZ7550 showed a similar potency to osimertinib, while AZ5104 showed greater potency against exon 19 deletion and T790M mutants (approximately 8-fold) and wild-type (approximately 15-fold) EGFR. In vitro, osimertinib also inhibited the activity of HER2, HER3, HER4, ACK1, and BLK at clinically relevant concentrations. In cultured cells and animal tumor implantation models, osimertinib exhibited anti-tumor activity against NSCLC lines harboring EGFR-mutations (T790M/L858R, L858R, T790M/exon 19 deletion, and exon 19 deletion) and, to a lesser extent, wild-type EGFR amplifications. Osimertinib distributed to the brain in multiple animal species (monkey, rat, and mouse) with brain to plasma AUC ratios of approximately 2 following oral dosing. These data are consistent with observations of tumor regression and increased survival in osimertinib- versus control-treated animals in a pre-clinical mutant-EGFR intracranial mouse metastasis xenograft model (PC9; exon 19 deletion). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on an analysis of dose-exposure response relationships over the dose range of 20 mg (0.25 times the recommended dose) to 240 mg (3 times the recommended dose), no apparent relationship between osimertinib exposure and overall response rate, duration of response and progression-free survival was identified; however, there were limited data available at the 20 mg dose. Over the same dose range, increased exposure led to increased probability of adverse reactions, specifically rash, diarrhea and ILD. Cardiac Electrophysiology The QTc interval prolongation potential of osimertinib was assessed in 210 patients who received TAGRISSO 80 mg daily in AURA2. A central tendency analysis of the QTcF data at steady-state demonstrated that the maximum mean change from baseline was 16.2 msec (upper bound of two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) 17.6 msec). A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis in AURA2 suggested a concentration-dependent QTc interval prolongation of 14 msec (upper bound of two-sided 90% CI: 16 msec) at a dose of TAGRISSO 80 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of osimertinib increased dose proportionally over 20 to 240 mg dose range (i.e., 0.25 to 3 times the recommended dosage) after oral administration and exhibited linear pharmacokinetics (PK). Administration of TAGRISSO orally once daily resulted in approximately 3-fold accumulation with steady-state exposures achieved after 15 days of dosing. At steady state, the Cmax to Cmin (minimal concentration) ratio was 1.6-fold. Absorption The median time to Cmax of osimertinib was 6 hours (range 3-24 hours). Following administration of a 20 mg TAGRISSO tablet with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (containing approximately 58 grams of fat and 1000 calories), the Cmax and AUC of osimertinib were comparable to that under fasting conditions. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss/F) of osimertinib was 918 L. Plasma protein binding of osimertinib was 95%. Elimination Osimertinib plasma concentrations decreased with time and a population estimated mean half-life of osimertinib was 48 hours, and oral clearance (CL/F) was 14.3 (L/h). Metabolism The main metabolic pathways of osimertinib were oxidation (predominantly CYP3A) and dealkylation in vitro. Two pharmacologically active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104) have been identified in the plasma after TAGRISSO oral administration. The geometric mean exposure (AUC) of each metabolite (AZ5104 and AZ7550) was approximately 10% of the exposure of osimertinib at steady-state. Excretion Osimertinib is primarily eliminated in the feces (68%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (14%). Unchanged osimertinib accounted for approximately 2% of the elimination. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib were observed based on age, sex, ethnicity, body weight, baseline albumin, line of therapy, smoking status, renal function (creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≥15 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault), or hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B, or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin between 1 to 3 times ULN and any AST). The pharmacokinetics of osimertinib in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr < 15 mL/min) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 3 to 10 times ULN and any AST) are unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and (8.7)]. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on TAGRISSO in Clinical Pharmacokinetic Studies Strong CYP3A Inducers: The steady-state AUC of osimertinib was reduced by 78% in patients when co-administered with rifampin (600 mg daily for 21 days) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administering TAGRISSO with 200 mg itraconazole twice daily (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of osimertinib (AUC increased by 24% and Cmax decreased by 20%). Gastric Acid Reducing Agents: The exposure of osimertinib was not affected by concurrent administration of a single 80 mg TAGRISSO tablet following 40 mg omeprazole administration for 5 days. Effect of Osimertinib on Other Drugs in Clinical Pharmacokinetic Studies BCRP substrates: Co-administering TAGRISSO with rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate) increased rosuvastatin AUC by 35% and Cmax by 72% [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. P-gp substrates: Co-administering TAGRISSO with fexofenadine (a P-gp substrate) increased fexofenadine AUC and Cmax by 56% and 76% after a single dose and 27% and 25% at steady state, respectively. CYP3A4 substrates: Co-administering TAGRISSO with simvastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate) had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of simvastatin. In Vitro Studies CYP450 Metabolic Pathways: Osimertinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1. Osimertinib induced CYP1A2 enzymes. Transporter Systems: Osimertinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and BCRP and is not a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Osimertinib is an inhibitor of BCRP and does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2K and OCT2."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with osimertinib. Osimertinib did not cause genetic damage in in vitro and in vivo assays. Based on studies in animals, male fertility may be impaired by treatment with TAGRISSO. Degenerative changes were present in the testes in rats and dogs exposed to osimertinib for 1 month or more with evidence of reversibility in the rat. Following administration of osimertinib to rats for approximately 10 weeks at a dose of 40 mg/kg, at exposures 0.5 times the AUC observed at the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg once daily, there was a reduction in male fertility, demonstrated by increased pre-implantation loss in untreated females mated to treated males. Based on studies in animals, female fertility may be impaired by treatment with TAGRISSO. In repeat dose toxicity studies, histological evidence of anestrus, corpora lutea degeneration in the ovaries and epithelial thinning in the uterus and vagina were seen in rats exposed to osimertinib for 1 month or more at exposures 0.3 times the AUC observed at the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg once daily. Findings in the ovaries seen following 1 month of dosing exhibited evidence of reversibility. In a female fertility study in rats, administration of osimertinib from 2 weeks prior to mating through Day 8 of gestation at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the Cmax at the recommended dose of 80 mg once daily) had no effects on oestrus cycling or the number of females becoming pregnant, but caused early embryonic deaths. These findings showed evidence of reversibility when females were mated 1 month after treatment discontinuation."
