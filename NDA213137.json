Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10% with a difference of >3% compared to placebo) are headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, rash, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) reported in pediatric patients 4 to <12 years are pyrexia, vomiting, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc. at 1-833-GBT-4YOU (1-833-428-4968) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults and Pediatric Patients 12 Years and Older The safety of OXBRYTA was evaluated in the HOPE trial based on data from 88 patients with SCD who received OXBRYTA 1,500 mg and 91 patients who received placebo orally once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Seventy-four patients received OXBRYTA 1,500 mg once daily for ≥24 weeks, 65 patients for ≥48 weeks, and 63 patients completed the 72-week treatment period. In patients who received OXBRYTA 1,500 mg once daily the median age was 24 years (range:12 to 59 years); 65% female; 66% Black or African American and 23% Arab/Middle Eastern; and 65% receiving hydroxyurea at baseline. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 3% (3/88) of patients receiving OXBRYTA 1,500 mg, which included headache, drug hypersensitivity, and pulmonary embolism occurring in 1 patient each. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction (Grades 1-4) occurred in 5% (4/88) of patients who received OXBRYTA 1,500 mg. Dosage modifications (dose reduction or dosing interruption) due to an adverse reaction occurred in 48% (42/88) of patients who received OXBRYTA. Most frequent adverse reactions requiring dosage modifications occurring in more than two patients who received OXBRYTA 1,500 mg included diarrhea and rash. The safety profile observed in pediatric patients 12 to <17 years treated with OXBRYTA in the HOPE trial was similar to that seen in adult patients. The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of patients treated with OXBRYTA 1,500 mg with a difference of >3% compared to placebo are summarized in Table 4. Table 4: Adverse Reactions (≥10%) in Patients Receiving OXBRYTA with a Difference Between Arms of >3% Compared to Placebo in HOPE Adverse Reaction Adverse reactions were Grades 1 or 2 except for Grade 3 headache (2), diarrhea (1), nausea (1), rash (1), and rash generalized (3) OXBRYTA 1,500 mg (N=88) Placebo (N=91) Headache 32% 25% Diarrhea 23% 11% Abdominal Pain Abdominal pain (grouped PTs) includes the following PTs: abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, and upper abdominal pain 23% 16% Nausea 19% 10% Rash Rash (grouped PTs) includes the following PTs: rash, urticaria, generalized rash, macular rash, maculo-papular rash, pruritic rash, and papular rash 15% 11% Pyrexia 15% 8% Clinically relevant adverse reactions occurring in <10% of patients included: Drug hypersensitivity Pediatric Patients 4 to <12 Years The safety of OXBRYTA in pediatric patients 4 to <12 years with SCD was evaluated in an open-label, Phase 2 study [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In this study, 45 patients 4 to <12 years of age received doses of OXBRYTA tablets for oral suspension based on weight at baseline. Thirty-five patients received OXBRYTA for 24 weeks and 26 patients for 48 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (>10%) reported in pediatric patients 4 to <12 years were pyrexia (36%), vomiting (33%), rash (20%), abdominal pain (18%), diarrhea (18%), and headache (18%).

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on OXBRYTA use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of voxelotor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at exposures up to 2.8-times (rats) and 0.3-times (rabbits) the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose resulted in no adverse developmental effects (see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is approximately 14% and up to 43%, respectively. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with SCD in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). OXBRYTA should only be used during pregnancy if the benefit of the drug outweighs the potential risk. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Women with SCD have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for the mother and the fetus. Pregnant women are at greater risk for vasoocclusive crises, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and maternal mortality. For the fetus, there is an increased risk for intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, voxelotor was administered orally to pregnant rats at 15, 50, and 250 mg/kg/day (gestation days 7 through 17) and rabbits at 25, 75, and 150 mg/kg/day (gestation days 7 through 19) through organogenesis. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose levels in these studies equivalent to 2.8-times (rats) and 0.3-times (rabbits) the exposures in patients receiving OXBRYTA at the recommended daily dose. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in rats or rabbits. In a pre- and postnatal development study, voxelotor was administered orally to pregnant rats at 15, 50 and 250 mg/kg/day (gestation day 6 through lactation day 20). Maternal gestational body weights were decreased at 250 mg/kg/day, which continued to the end of lactation. The findings in offspring included reduced survival and reduced body weights throughout lactation, weaning and maturation. The effects in offspring were observed at the maternal dose of 250 mg/kg/day with an exposure approximately 2.8-times the exposure in patients at the recommended dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of voxelotor in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Voxelotor was detected in milk in lactating rats. Plasma concentrations of voxelotor in pregnant rats were higher than the concentration in milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The concentration of voxelotor in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, including changes in the hematopoietic system, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with OXBRYTA, and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of OXBRYTA for SCD have been established in pediatric patients aged 4 years and older. The safety and efficacy of OXBRYTA in pediatric patients with SCD below the age of 4 years have not been established. Use of OXBRYTA in pediatric patients 12 to <17 years for SCD is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in adults and pediatric patients (HOPE trial). The HOPE trial enrolled 26 pediatric patients aged 12 to <17 years, in which 12 pediatric patients received OXBRYTA 1,500 mg once daily and 14 pediatric patients received OXBRYTA 900 mg once daily [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Use of OXBRYTA in pediatric patients 4 to <12 years for SCD is supported by evidence from an open-label, Phase 2 study. The study enrolled 45 pediatric patients aged 4 to <12 years and 11 patients aged 12 to <17 years with SCD. Patients 12 to <17 years received OXBRYTA 1,500 mg once daily. Patients 4 to <12 years were administered OXBRYTA based on body weight. OXBRYTA doses of 600 mg, 900 mg, or 1,500 mg once daily were administered to patients weighing 10 kg to <20 kg, 20 kg to <40 kg, or ≥40 kg, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy were similar across the pediatric age groups and across pediatric and adult patients [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. The adverse reactions observed were similar across the pediatric age groups and across pediatric and adult patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of OXBRYTA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Severe hepatic impairment increases voxelotor exposures [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Reduce OXBRYTA dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ]."

Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, voxelotor was administered orally to pregnant rats at 15, 50, and 250 mg/kg/day (gestation days 7 through 17) and rabbits at 25, 75, and 150 mg/kg/day (gestation days 7 through 19) through organogenesis. Maternal toxicity was observed at the highest dose levels in these studies equivalent to 2.8-times (rats) and 0.3-times (rabbits) the exposures in patients receiving OXBRYTA at the recommended daily dose. There was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes in rats or rabbits. In a pre- and postnatal development study, voxelotor was administered orally to pregnant rats at 15, 50 and 250 mg/kg/day (gestation day 6 through lactation day 20). Maternal gestational body weights were decreased at 250 mg/kg/day, which continued to the end of lactation. The findings in offspring included reduced survival and reduced body weights throughout lactation, weaning and maturation. The effects in offspring were observed at the maternal dose of 250 mg/kg/day with an exposure approximately 2.8-times the exposure in patients at the recommended dose."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Voxelotor is a hemoglobin S (HbS) polymerization inhibitor that binds to HbS with a 1:1 stoichiometry and exhibits preferential partitioning to red blood cells (RBCs). By increasing the affinity of Hb for oxygen, voxelotor demonstrates dose-dependent inhibition of HbS polymerization. Nonclinical studies suggest that voxelotor may inhibit RBC sickling, improve RBC deformability, and reduce whole blood viscosity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic effect of voxelotor treatment demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in Hb oxygen affinity as determined by the change in p50 (partial pressure of oxygen at which Hb oxygen saturation of 50% is achieved) that was linearly correlated with voxelotor exposure. The pharmacodynamic effect of voxelotor treatment also demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in clinical measures of hemolysis (indirect bilirubin and % reticulocytes). Cardiac Electrophysiology At plasma concentrations approximately 2-fold above therapeutic concentrations, voxelotor does not prolong QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Voxelotor is absorbed into plasma and is then distributed predominantly into RBCs due to its preferential binding to Hb. The major route of elimination of voxelotor is by metabolism with subsequent excretion of metabolites into urine and feces. The PK are linear and voxelotor exposures increased proportionally with either single or multiple doses (Table 5) in whole blood, plasma, and RBCs. Steady-state after repeated administration is reached within 8 days and exposures of voxelotor are consistent with accumulation predicted based on single dose data in patients with SCD. Table 5: Pharmacokinetics Parameters of Voxelotor in Plasma and Whole Blood Based on the 72-week population pharmacokinetic analysis. PK Parameter Voxelotor 1,500 mg Geometric Mean (%CV) Plasma PK AUC 0-24h (μg∙hr/mL) 278 (28.4) C max (µg/mL) 14 (24.5) Half-life (hours) 38.7 (30.2) Whole Blood PK AUC 0-24h (μg∙hr/mL) 3,830 (33.5) C max (µg/mL) 180 (31) In healthy subjects, voxelotor exposures were comparable when administered as tablet for oral suspension dispersed in water or as oral tablet swallowed whole. Absorption The median plasma and whole blood T max of voxelotor after oral administration is 2 hours. The mean peak concentrations in whole blood and RBCs are observed between 6 and 18 hours after oral administration. Effect of Food A high-fat, high-calorie meal increased voxelotor AUC by 42% and C max by 45% in whole blood relative to AUC and C max in the fasted state. Similarly, AUC increased by 42% and C max increased by 95% in plasma. Distribution Voxelotor apparent volume of distribution of the central compartment and peripheral compartment are 333 L and 72.3 L in plasma, respectively. Protein binding is 99.8% in vitro. The blood-to-plasma ratio is approximately 17:1 in patients with SCD. Elimination The geometric mean (%CV) terminal elimination half-life of voxelotor in patients with SCD is 38.7 hours (30.2%) with concentrations in plasma, whole blood, and RBCs declining in parallel. The apparent oral clearance of voxelotor was estimated as 6.1 L/h in plasma in patients with SCD. Metabolism In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that voxelotor is extensively metabolized through Phase I (oxidation and reduction), Phase II (glucuronidation) and combinations of Phase I and II metabolism. Metabolism of voxelotor is mediated by CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, UGT1A1, and UGT1A9. Excretion Following the administration of radiolabeled voxelotor, approximately 62.6% of the dose and its metabolites are excreted into feces (33.3% unchanged) and 35.5% in urine (0.08% unchanged). Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of voxelotor were observed based on age (12 to 59 years), sex, body weight (28 to 135 kg), or mild to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 15-89 mL/min). Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetic exposures of voxelotor in whole blood and plasma were similar between pediatric patients 4 to <17 years and adults following the recommended dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment There was no clinically significant effect of renal function on the excretion of voxelotor. Following a single 900 mg dose of voxelotor, whole blood exposures in subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) were 25% lower compared to healthy controls. The unbound plasma concentrations were comparable. OXBRYTA has not been evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The voxelotor AUC in whole blood were 14% and 15% higher in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A and B) and 90% higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with HbSC Genotype Voxelotor steady state whole blood AUC and C max were 50% and 45% higher in HbSC genotype patients (n=11) compared to HbSS genotype (n=220) patients and voxelotor steady state plasma AUC and C max were 23% and 15% higher in HbSC genotype patients compared to HbSS genotype patients. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Voxelotor: concomitant use of OXBRYTA with itraconazole increased voxelotor AUC in healthy subjects by 11%. Effect of Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers on Voxelotor : concomitant use of OXBRYTA with rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) is predicted to decrease voxelotor AUC in patients by up to 40%, and efavirenz (a moderate CYP3A4 inducer) is predicted to decrease voxelotor AUC in patients by up to 24%. Effect of Acid Reducing Agents on Voxelotor: coadministration of omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor) with OXBRYTA did not alter voxelotor exposure. Effect of Voxelotor on CYP450 Enzymes: in vivo voxelotor inhibits CYP3A4, but not CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, or CYP2D6. The observed exposure increase of the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam in healthy subjects was 1.6-fold and the predicted increase in patients after multiple dosing is 2.5-fold. Effect of Voxelotor on P-gp : concomitant use of OXBRYTA with digoxin (a P-gp substrate) did not alter digoxin to a clinically relevant extent. In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes: voxelotor is a reversible and time-dependent inhibitor as well as an inducer of CYP2B6. Transporter Systems : voxelotor is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2-K, or BSEP. Voxelotor is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1A2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BSEP."

In this study, 274 patients were randomized to daily oral administration of OXBRYTA 1,500 mg (N=90), OXBRYTA 900 mg (N=92), or placebo (N=92). Patients were included if they had from 1 to 10 vasoocclusive crisis (VOC) events within 12 months prior to enrollment and baseline hemoglobin (Hb) ≥5.5 to ≤10.5 g/dL. Eligible patients on stable doses of hydroxyurea for at least 90 days were allowed to continue hydroxyurea therapy throughout the study. Randomization was stratified by patients already receiving hydroxyurea (yes, no), geographic region (North America, Europe, Other), and age (12 to <17 years, 18 to 65 years). The trial excluded patients who received red blood cell (RBC) transfusions within 60 days and erythropoietin within 28 days of enrollment, had renal insufficiency, uncontrolled liver disease, were pregnant, or lactating. The majority of patients had HbSS or HbS/beta 0 -thalassemia genotype (90%) and were receiving background hydroxyurea therapy (65%). The median age was 24 years (range: 12 to 64 years); 46 (17%) patients were 12 to <17 years. Median baseline Hb was 8.5 g/dL (5.9 to 10.8 g/dL). One hundred and fifteen (42%) had 1 VOC event and 159 (58%) had 2 to 10 events within 12 months prior to enrollment. In the OXBRYTA 1,500 mg group, 63 (70%) patients completed the study through Week 72. Efficacy was based on Hb response rate defined as a Hb increase of >1 g/dL from baseline to Week 24 in patients treated with OXBRYTA 1,500 mg versus placebo. The response rate for OXBRYTA 1,500 mg was 51.1% (46/90) compared to 6.5% (6/92) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). No outlier subgroups were observed. The distribution of Hb change from baseline for individual patients completing 24 weeks of treatment with OXBRYTA 1,500 mg or placebo is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: Subject-level Change from Baseline in Hemoglobin at Week 24 in Patients Who Completed 24 Weeks of Treatment Approximately 83% of all randomized patients completed 24 weeks of treatment. Additional efficacy evaluation included change in Hb and percent change in indirect bilirubin and percent reticulocyte count from baseline to Week 24 (Table 6).

In this study, 45 patients 4 to <12 years and 11 patients 12 to <17 years received OXBRYTA. Patients 4 to <12 years received tablets for oral suspension based on body weight at baseline. OXBRYTA doses of 600 mg, 900 mg, or 1,500 mg once daily were administered to patients weighing 10 kg to <20 kg, 20 kg to <40 kg, or ≥40 kg, respectively. Patients 12 to <17 years received OXBRYTA 1,500 mg once daily. Patients were included if their baseline hemoglobin (Hb) was ≤10.5 g/dL. Eligible patients on stable doses of hydroxyurea for at least 90 days were allowed to continue hydroxyurea therapy throughout the study. The trial excluded patients who had a VOC event within 14 days prior to enrollment, received red blood cell (RBC) transfusions within 30 days of enrollment, and had renal insufficiency or uncontrolled liver disease. All patients had HbSS or HbS/beta 0 -thalassemia genotype (100%) and most were receiving background hydroxyurea therapy (80%). The median age was 8 years (range: 4 to 15 years); 45 (80%) patients were 4 to <12 years. In this age group, mean baseline Hb was 8.6 g/dL (range: 6.1 to 10.5 g/dL). Efficacy was based on Hb response rate, which is defined as a Hb increase of >1 g/dL from baseline to Week 24. Hb response rate for OXBRYTA in patients aged 4 to <12 years who took at least one dose of OXBRYTA was 36% (16/45) (95% CI: 21.6%, 49.5%)."
