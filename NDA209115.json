        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dose is 600 mg orally twice daily with or without food. ( 2.2 ) Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ( 2.2 ) For adverse reactions, consider interruption of treatment or dose reduction. ( 2.3 ) Patients receiving RUBRACA for mCRPC should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Maintenance Treatment of BRCA -mutated Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Select patients for the maintenance treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer with Rubraca based on the presence of a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. An FDA-approved test for the detection of deleterious germline and/or somatic BRCA mutations is not currently available. Treatment of BRCA -mutated mCRPC after Androgen Receptor-directed Therapy and Chemotherapy Select patients for the treatment of mCRPC with Rubraca based on the presence of a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) in plasma specimens [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. A negative result from a plasma specimen does not mean that the patient's tumor is negative for BRCA mutations. Should the plasma specimen have a negative result, consider performing further genomic testing using tumor specimens as clinically indicated. Information on the FDA-approved tests for the detection of a BRCA mutation in patients with ovarian cancer or with prostate cancer is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Dose The recommended dose of Rubraca is 600 mg (two 300 mg tablets) taken orally twice daily with or without food, for a total daily dose of 1,200 mg. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If a patient misses a dose of Rubraca, instruct the patient to take the next dose at its scheduled time. Vomited doses should not be replaced. Patients receiving Rubraca for mCRPC should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. 2.3 Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions To manage adverse reactions, consider interruption of treatment or dose reduction. Recommended Rubraca dose modifications for adverse reactions are indicated in Table 1 . Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): MDS/AML occurred in patients exposed to RUBRACA, and some cases were fatal. Monitor patients for hematological toxicity at baseline and monthly thereafter. Interrupt or reduce the dose based on severity of reaction. Discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: RUBRACA can cause fetal harm. Advise of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) occur in patients treated with Rubraca, and are potentially fatal adverse reactions. In 1594 treated patients with ovarian cancer [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] , MDS/AML occurred in 32 patients (2%), including those in long term follow-up. Of these, 14 occurred during treatment or during the 28-day safety follow-up (0.9%). The duration of Rubraca treatment prior to the diagnosis of MDS/AML ranged from < 2 months to approximately 72 months. The cases were typical of secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML; in all cases, patients had received previous platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens and/or other DNA damaging agents. In ARIEL3, of patients with a germline and/or somatic BRCA mutation treated with Rubraca, MDS/AML occurred in 9 out of 129 (7%) patients treated with Rubraca and 4 out of 66 (6%) patients treated with placebo. The duration of therapy with Rubraca in patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML varied from 1.2 to 4.7 years. In TRITON2, MDS/AML was not observed in patients with mCRPC (n=209) regardless of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) mutation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Do not start Rubraca until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤ Grade 1). Monitor complete blood counts for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities (> 4 weeks), interrupt Rubraca or reduce dose according to Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks or if MDS/AML is suspected, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue Rubraca. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Rubraca can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies. In an animal reproduction study, administration of rucaparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal death at exposures that were 0.04 times the AUC 0-24h in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 600 mg twice daily. Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of Rubraca [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Based on findings from genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of Rubraca [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) among patients with ovarian cancer were nausea, fatigue (including asthenia), anemia, AST/ALT increased, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, thrombocytopenia, dysgeusia, neutropenia, blood creatinine increased, dyspnea, dizziness, dyspepsia, photosensitivity reaction, and leukopenia. ( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) among patients with BRCA -mutated mCRPC were fatigue (including asthenia), nausea, anemia, ALT/AST increased, decreased appetite, rash, constipation, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ZR pharma& GmbH agent at 1-800-506-850 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population for patients with ovarian cancer in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to Rubraca at 600 mg orally twice daily in 1594 patients treated on clinical trials including ARIEL3. In this group, 57% of patients were exposed for 6 months or longer and 33% were exposed for greater than one year. In the pooled safety population for patients with ovarian cancer, the most common adverse reactions in ≥ 10% of patients were nausea (68%), asthenia/fatigue (65%), anemia/hemoglobin decreased (45%), AST/ALT increased (39%), vomiting (36%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (27%), thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased (25%), dysgeusia (24%), neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased (21%), blood creatinine increased (17%), dyspnea (16%), dizziness (14%), dyspepsia(11%), photosensitivity reaction (10%), and leukopenia/white blood cell count decreased (10%). Maintenance Treatment of BRCA -mutated Recurrent Ovarian Cancer The safety of Rubraca for the maintenance treatment of patients with BRCA -mutated recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer was investigated in ARIEL3, a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 195 patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation received either Rubraca 600 mg orally twice daily (n=129) or placebo (n=66) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of study treatment was 13.6 months (range: < 1 month to 39 months) for patients who received Rubraca and 5.5 months for patients who received placebo. Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 67% of patients receiving Rubraca and 14% of those receiving placebo; dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 57% of Rubraca patients and 6% of placebo patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption or dose reduction of Rubraca were thrombocytopenia (25%), anemia (19%), AST/ALT increased (16%), fatigue/asthenia (14%), and nausea (10%). Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of Rubraca patients and 5% of placebo patients. Specific adverse reactions that most frequently led to discontinuation in patients treated with Rubraca were thrombocytopenia (4%), nausea (3%), and anemia (2%). Table 2 describes the adverse reactions occurring in ≥20% of patients; while Table 3 describes the laboratory abnormalities occurring in ≥25% of patients occurring in ARIEL3. Table 2.

TRITON2 enrolled 209 patients with HRD-positive mCRPC, including 115 with BRCA -mutated mCRPC. Among the patients with BRCA -mutated mCRPC, the median duration of Rubraca treatment was 6.5 months (range 0.5 to 26.7). There were 2 (1.7%) patients with adverse reactions leading to death, one each attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 57% of patients receiving Rubraca. Adverse reactions requiring dose interruption in >3% of patients included anemia, thrombocytopenia, asthenia/fatigue, nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, ALT/AST increased, creatinine increased, decreased appetite, acute kidney injury, and hypophosphatemia. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 41% of patients receiving Rubraca. Adverse reactions requiring dose reduction in >3% of patients were anemia (14%), asthenia/fatigue (10%), thrombocytopenia (7%), nausea (6%), decreased appetite (4%), and rash (3%). Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 8% of patients receiving Rubraca. None of the adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Rubraca (ECG QT prolonged, acute respiratory distress syndrome, anemia, balance disorder, cardiac failure, decreased appetite/fatigue/weight decreased, leukopenia/neutropenia, ALT/AST increased, and pneumonia) occurred in more than one patient (<1%).

If concomitant administration is unavoidable between Rubraca and substrates of these enzymes where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions, decrease the substrate dosage in accordance with the approved prescribing information.

( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Rubraca can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In an animal reproduction study, administration of rucaparib to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal death at maternal exposures that were 0.04 times the AUC 0-24h in patients receiving the recommended dose of 600 mg twice daily [see Data] . Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a dose range-finding embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats received oral doses of 50, 150, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day of rucaparib during the period of organogenesis. Post-implantation loss (100% early resorptions) was observed in all animals at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg/day (with maternal systemic exposures approximately 0.04 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC 0-24h ). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of rucaparib in human milk, or on its effects on milk production or the breast-fed child. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed children from Rubraca, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with Rubraca and for 2 weeks following the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Rubraca can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Rubraca. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of Rubraca [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Males Based on findings in genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective methods of contraception during treatment and for 3 months following last dose of Rubraca. Advise male patients not to donate sperm during therapy and for 3 months following the last dose of Rubraca [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Rubraca in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 937 patients with ovarian cancer who received Rubraca in clinical trials including ARIEL3, 41% were age 65 or older and 10% were 75 years or older. No major differences in safety were observed between younger and older patients with ovarian cancer. Of the 209 patients with mCRPC who received Rubraca in TRITON2, 77% were age 65 or older and 33% were 75 years or older. No major differences in safety were observed between younger and older patients with mCRPC. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] between 30 and 89 mL/min, as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault method) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Rubraca has not been studied in patients with CLcr < 30 mL/min or patients on dialysis. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal [ULN] or AST > ULN) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Rubraca has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST)."

In vitro studies have shown that rucaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis, and cancer cell death. Increased rucaparib-induced cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity was observed in tumor cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes. Rucaparib has been shown to decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer with or without deficiencies in BRCA . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of rucaparib has not fully been characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology A positive concentration-QTc relationship was observed in patients who were administered continuous dosages of Rubraca ranging from 40 mg once daily (0.03 times the approved recommended dosage) to 840 mg twice daily (1.4 times the approved recommended dosage). The mean (90% confidence interval [CI]) QTcF increase from baseline at steady state of Rubraca 600 mg twice daily was 14.9 msec (11.1, 18.7 msec). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The AUC and C max of rucaparib demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics over a dose range from 240 mg to 840 mg twice daily (0.4 times to 1.4 times the approved recommended dosage). The mean (coefficient of variation [CV]) steady-state rucaparib C max is 1,940 ng/mL (54%) and AUC 0-12h is 16,900 h×ng/mL (54%) at the approved recommended dosage. The mean AUC accumulation ratio is 3.5 to 6.2 fold. Absorption The median T max (min, max) at the steady state is 1.9 hours (0, 5.98) at the approved recommended dosage. The mean (min, max) absolute bioavailability is 36% (30%, 45%). Effect of Food Following a high-fat meal (approximately 800-1000 calories, including approximately 250 calories from carbohydrates, approximately 500-600 calories from fat, approximately 150 calories from protein), the C max was increased by 20%, AUC 0-24h was increased by 38%, and the T max was delayed by 2.5 hours, as compared to fasted conditions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution is 2300 L (21%). Rucaparib is 70% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. Rucaparib preferentially distributed to red blood cells with a blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of 1.8. Elimination The mean apparent total clearance at steady state is 44.2 L/h (45%) and the mean terminal elimination half-life is 26 (39%) hours. Metabolism In vitro, rucaparib is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. In addition to CYP-based oxidation, rucaparib also undergoes N-demethylation, N-methylation, and glucuronidation. Excretion Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled rucaparib, unchanged rucaparib accounted for 64% of the radioactivity. Rucaparib accounted for 45% and 95% of radioactivity in urine and feces, respectively. Specific Populations Age (20 to 86 years), race (White, Black, and Asian), sex, body weight (41 to 171 kg), mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥ 30 mL/min), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin < ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST), and CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 genotype polymorphisms did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of rucaparib. The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min), end-stage renal disease (CLcr < 15 mL/min), or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST) has not been studied. Hepatic Impairment Moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) increased rucaparib AUC by 45%, but had no effect on C max compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches Effect of Other Drugs on Rucaparib Concomitant administration of Rubraca with a proton pump inhibitor had no clinically meaningful effect on steady-state concentrations of rucaparib. Effect of Rucaparib on Other Drugs Concomitant administration of Rubraca with rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) had no clinically meaningful effect on the concentrations of rosuvastatin. Coadministration of Rubraca with the following substrates increased the C max of each coadministered substrate by ≤ 1.1-fold and increased the AUC of each substrate as follows: Caffeine (CYP1A2): by 2.6-fold Midazolam (CYP3A4): by 1.4-fold Warfarin (CYP2C9): by 1.5-fold Omeprazole (CYP2C19): by 1.6-fold Digoxin (P-glycoprotein): by 1.2-fold Concomitant administration of Rubraca with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel (CYP3A substrates): increased ethinylestradiol AUC by 1.4-fold and levonorgestrel AUC by 1.6-fold, but did not have a clinically meaningful effect on their C max . In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes : Rucaparib inhibited CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 and induced CYP1A2. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) Enzymes : Rucaparib inhibited UGT1A1. Transporter Systems : Rucaparib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. Rucaparib is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. Rucaparib inhibited OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2-K, OCT1, OCT2, and MRP4. Rucaparib did not inhibit MRP2, MRP3, or BSEP."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Maintenance Treatment of BRCA -mutated Recurrent Ovarian Cancer The efficacy of Rubraca was investigated in ARIEL3 (NCT01968213), a double-blind, multicenter clinical trial in which 564 patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who were in response to platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized (2:1) to receive Rubraca tablets 600 mg orally twice daily (n=375) or placebo (n=189). Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients had achieved a response (complete or partial) to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by best response to last platinum (complete or partial), time to progression following the penultimate platinum therapy (6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months), and tumor biomarker status. Tumor tissue samples were tested using a clinical trial assay (CTA) (N=564) and an investigational Foundation Medicine tissue test (n=518). Of the samples evaluated with both tests, tumor BRCA (t BRCA ) mutant status was confirmed for 99% (177/178) of t BRCA -positive patients determined by the CTA. Blood samples for 94% (186/196) of the t BRCA patients were evaluated using a central blood germline BRCA test. Based on these results, 70% (130/186) of the t BRCA patients had a germline BRCA mutation and 30% (56/186) had a somatic BRCA mutation. The efficacy results are based on the t BRCA (germline or somatic) subgroup. The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 (v1.1). Overall survival (OS) was an additional outcome measure. Of the 564 enrolled patients, 196 patients (35%) had a t BRCA mutation. Among the patients who had a tBRCA mutation, the median age was 58 years (range: 42 to 81) for patients receiving Rubraca and 59 years (range: 36 to 84) for those on placebo; the majority were White (84%); and 100% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. All patients had received at least two prior platinum-based chemotherapies (range: 2 to 5). A total of 33% of patients were in complete response (CR) to their most recent therapy. The progression-free interval to penultimate platinum was 6-12 months in 41% of patients and > 12 months in 59%. Prior bevacizumab therapy was reported for 22% of patients who received Rubraca and 17% of patients who received placebo. Measurable disease was present at baseline in 32% of patients. ARIEL3 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to Rubraca as compared with placebo in patients who had a t BRCA mutation. Results from a blinded independent radiology review were consistent. Efficacy results for patients with a t BRCA mutation are summarized in Table 6 and Figure 1 . Table 6.

Figure 1 14.2 BRCA -mutated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer The efficacy of Rubraca was investigated in TRITON2 (NCT02952534), an ongoing multi-center, single arm clinical trial in patients with BRCA -mutated mCRPC who had been treated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and taxane-based chemotherapy. There were 115 patients with either germline or somatic BRCA mutations enrolled in TRITON2, of whom 62 patients had measurable disease at baseline by independent radiology review (IRR). Patients received Rubraca 600 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also received concomitant GnRH analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. Objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) were assessed in patients with measurable disease by blinded IRR and by the investigator according to modified RECIST v1.1/ Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria. For the 62 patients with measurable disease at baseline, the median age was 73 years (range 52 to 88); the majority were White (73%) and 10% were Black; and 98% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. All patients had received at least one prior androgen receptor-directed therapy, 34% had received 2 prior androgen receptor-directed therapies and 2% had received 3 prior androgen receptor-directed therapies, and all patients also received prior taxane chemotherapy. Eighteen percent of patients had lung and 21% had liver metastases at baseline. Twenty-four percent had metastases to lymph nodes alone. Forty percent had 10 or more bone lesions at baseline. All 62 patients had a deleterious somatic or germline BRCA mutation detected from either central plasma (26%), central tissue (32%), or local (42%) testing. Of the 62 patients, 66% had a somatic BRCA mutation, 34% had a germline BRCA mutation, 85% had a BRCA2 mutation, and 15% had a BRCA1 mutation. The major efficacy outcomes of the study were confirmed ORR by IRR using modified RECIST v1.1/PCWG3 criteria and DOR. Efficacy results of TRITON2 are provided in Table 7 . The ORR by IRR was similar in patients with germline versus somatic BRCA mutation. Table 7.

Revised: September 2023 PATIENT INFORMATION Rubraca ® (roo-brah'-kah) (rucaparib) tablets What is the most important information I should know about Rubraca? Rubraca may cause serious side effects including: Bone marrow problems called Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or a type of cancer of the blood called Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Some people who have cancer and who have received previous treatment with chemotherapy or certain other medicines for their cancer have developed MDS or AML during or after treatment with Rubraca. MDS or AML may lead to death. If you develop MDS or AML, your healthcare provider will stop treatment with Rubraca. Symptoms of low blood cell counts are common during treatment with Rubraca, but can be a sign of serious problems, including MDS or AML. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms during treatment with Rubraca: weakness weight loss fever frequent infections blood in urine or stool shortness of breath feeling very tired bruising or bleeding more easily Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your blood cell counts: before treatment with Rubraca. every month during treatment with Rubraca. weekly if you have low blood cell counts for a long time. Your healthcare provider may stop treatment with Rubraca until your blood cell counts improve. See \"What are possible side effects of Rubraca?\" for more information about side effects. What is Rubraca? Rubraca is a prescription medicine used in adults for: the maintenance treatment of ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer with a certain type of inherited (germline) or acquired (somatic) abnormal BRCA gene when your cancer has come back and you are in response (complete or partial response) to a platinum-based chemotherapy. the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (prostate cancer that no longer responds to medical or surgical treatment that lowers testosterone): that has spread to other parts of the body, and has a certain type of inherited (germline) or acquired (somatic) abnormal BRCA gene, and you have been treated with certain medicines for your cancer. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure Rubraca is right for you. It is not known if Rubraca is safe and effective in children. Before you take Rubraca, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Rubraca can harm your unborn baby and may cause loss of pregnancy (miscarriage). You should not become pregnant during treatment with Rubraca.
