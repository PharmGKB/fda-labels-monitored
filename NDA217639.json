      "dosage_and_administration": [
        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Select patients for treatment with ORSERDU based on the presence of ESR1 mutations. ( 2.1 ) The recommended dosage of ORSERDU is one 345 mg tablet taken orally, once daily, with food ( 2.2 ) Dose interruption, reduction, or permanent discontinuation may be required due to adverse reactions. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for treatment of ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with ORSERDU based on the presence of ESR1 mutation(s) in plasma specimen using an FDA-approved test [see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Information on FDA-approved tests for detection of ESR1 mutations in breast cancer is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of ORSERDU is 345 mg taken orally with food once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Take ORSERDU at approximately the same time each day. Take with food to reduce nausea and vomiting [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Swallow ORSERDU tablet(s) whole. Do not chew, crush, or split prior to swallowing. Do not take any ORSERDU tablets that are broken, cracked, or that look damaged. If a dose is missed for more than 6 hours or vomiting occurs, skip the dose and take the next dose the following day at its regularly scheduled time. 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dose reduction levels for adverse reactions are listed in Table 1 : Table 1: ORSERDU Dose Reduction Levels for Adverse Reactions 1 If further dose reduction below 172 mg once daily is required, permanently discontinue ORSERDU. Dose Reduction Dosage Number and Strength of Tablets First-dose reduction 258 mg once daily Three 86 mg tablets Second-dose reduction 172 mg once daily 1 Two 86 mg tablets Recommended dosage modifications of ORSERDU for adverse reactions are provided in Table 2 [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Table 2: ORSERDU Dosage Modification Guidelines for Adverse Reactions Severity Dosage Modification Grade 1 Continue ORSERDU at current dose level. Grade 2 Consider interruption of ORSERDU until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. Then resume ORSERDU at the same dose level. Grade 3 Interrupt ORSERDU until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. Then resume ORSERDU at the next lower dose level. If the Grade 3 toxicity recurs, interrupt ORSERDU until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. Then resume ORSERDU reduced by another dose level. Grade 4 Interrupt ORSERDU until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. Then resume ORSERDU reduced by one dose level. If a Grade 4 or intolerable adverse reaction recurs, permanently discontinue ORSERDU. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Use with Concomitant CYP3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of ORSERDU with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ORSERDU in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Reduce the ORSERDU dosage to 258 mg once daily for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyslipidemia: ORSERDU may cause hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Monitor lipid profile prior to starting treatment and periodically thereafter. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: ORSERDU can cause fetal harm. Advise of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Dyslipidemia Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia occurred in patients taking ORSERDU at an incidence of 30% and 27%, respectively. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia were 0.9% and 2.2%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor lipid profile prior to starting and periodically while taking ORSERDU. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, ORSERDU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of elacestrant to pregnant rats resulted in adverse developmental outcomes, including embryo-fetal mortality and structural abnormalities, at maternal exposures below the recommended dose based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ORSERDU and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ORSERDU and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Dyslipidemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] The most common (>10%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, of ORSERDU were musculoskeletal pain, nausea, increased cholesterol, increased AST, increased triglycerides, fatigue, decreased hemoglobin, vomiting, increased ALT, decreased sodium, increased creatinine, decreased appetite, diarrhea, headache, constipation, abdominal pain, hot flush, and dyspepsia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Stemline Therapeutics, Inc. at 1-877-332-7961 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ORSERDU was evaluated in 467 patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer following CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy in EMERALD, a randomized, open-label, multicenter study [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Patients received ORSERDU 345 mg orally once daily (n=237) or standard of care (SOC) consisting of fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor (n=230). Among patients who received ORSERDU, 22% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients who received ORSERDU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ORSERDU were musculoskeletal pain (1.7%) and nausea (1.3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.7% of patients who received ORSERDU, including cardiac arrest, septic shock, diverticulitis, and unknown cause (one patient each). Permanent discontinuation of ORSERDU due to an adverse reaction occurred in 6% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of ORSERDU in >1% of patients were musculoskeletal pain (1.7%) and nausea (1.3%). Dosage interruptions of ORSERDU due to an adverse reaction occurred in 15% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in dosage interruption of ORSERDU in >1% of patients were nausea (3.4%), musculoskeletal pain (1.7%), and increased ALT (1.3%). Dosage reductions of ORSERDU due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage reductions of ORSERDU in >1% of patients were nausea (1.7%). The most common (≥10%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, of ORSERDU were musculoskeletal pain, nausea, increased cholesterol, increased AST, increased triglycerides, fatigue, decreased hemoglobin, vomiting, increased ALT, decreased sodium, increased creatinine, decreased appetite, diarrhea, headache, constipation, abdominal pain, hot flush, and dyspepsia.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) Hepatic impairment : Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Reduce the dosage for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). ( 2.5 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, ORSERDU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no available human data on ORSERDU use in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In an animal reproduction study, oral administration of elacestrant to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal mortality and structural abnormalities at maternal exposures below the recommended dose based on AUC (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats, administration of oral doses of elacestrant up to 30 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, low food consumption, red vulvar discharge) and embryo-fetal mortality (increased resorptions, post-implantation loss, and reduced number of live fetuses) at ≥ 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the human AUC at the recommended dose). Additional adverse effects included reduced fetal weight and external malformations of the limbs (hyperflexion, malrotation) and head (domed, misshapen, flattened) with corresponding skeletal malformations of the skull at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the human AUC at the recommended dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of elacestrant in human milk, its effects on milk production, or the breastfed child. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise lactating women to not breastfeed during treatment with ORSERDU and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential ORSERDU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ORSERDU treatment. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ORSERDU and for 1 week after the last dose. Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ORSERDU and for 1 week after the last dose. Infertility Based on findings from animal studies, ORSERDU may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ORSERDU in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 237 patients who received ORSERDU in the EMERALD trial, 43% were 65 years of age or older and 17% were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of ORSERDU were observed between patients 65 years or older of age compared to younger patients. There are an insufficient number of patients 75 years of age or older to assess whether there are differences in safety or effectiveness. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ORSERDU in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Reduce the dose of ORSERDU in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, ORSERDU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no available human data on ORSERDU use in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In an animal reproduction study, oral administration of elacestrant to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal mortality and structural abnormalities at maternal exposures below the recommended dose based on AUC (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Elacestrant is an estrogen receptor antagonist that binds to estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα). In ER-positive (ER+) HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer cells, elacestrant inhibited 17β-estradiol mediated cell proliferation at concentrations inducing degradation of ERα protein mediated through proteasomal pathway. Elacestrant demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity including in ER+ HER2- breast cancer models resistant to fulvestrant and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors and those harboring estrogen receptor 1 gene ( ESR1 ) mutations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Elacestrant exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics have not been fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology ORSERDU does not cause a mean increase in QTc interval > 20 msec at the approved recommended dose. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The steady-state mean (%CV) maximum concentration (Cmax) of elacestrant is 119 ng/mL (43.6%) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-24h ) is 2440 ng*h/mL (44.3%) after administration of the recommended dosage of 345 mg once daily. The C max and AUC of elacestrant increase more than proportionally over a dosage range from 43 mg to 862 mg once daily (0.125 to 2.5 times the approved recommended dosage). Steady state is reached by Day 6 and the mean accumulation ratio based on AUC 0-24h is 2-fold. Absorption The time to achieve peak plasma concentration (t max ) ranges from 1 to 4 hours. The elacestrant oral bioavailability is approximately 10%. Effect of Food Administration of ORSERDU 345 mg with a high-fat meal (800 to 1000 calories, 50% fat) increased Cmax by 42% and AUC by 22% compared to fasted administration. Distribution The estimated apparent volume of distribution is 5800L. Plasma protein binding of elacestrant is >99% and independent of concentration. Elimination The elimination half-life of elacestrant is 30 to 50 hours. The estimated mean (% CV) clearance of elacestrant is 186 L/hr (43.5%) and renal clearance is ≤ 0.14 L/hr. Metabolism Elacestrant is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2A6 and CYP2C9. Excretion Following a single radiolabeled oral dose of 345 mg, 82% was recovered in feces (34% unchanged) and 7.5% was recovered in urine (< 1% unchanged). Specific Populations There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of elacestrant based on age (24 to 89 years), sex, and body weight (41 to 143 kg). Patients with Hepatic Impairment There were no clinically significant differences in the Cmax and AUC of elacestrant in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). The AUC of elacestrant increased in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) by 83%. Elacestrant has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of elacestrant when used concomitantly with cimetidine (weak CYP3A inhibitor), omeprazole (gastric acid-reducing agent), or warfarin (highly protein-bound drug).

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ORSERDU was evaluated in EMERALD (NCT03778931), a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter trial that enrolled 478 postmenopausal women and men with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer of which 228 patients had ESR1 mutations. Patients were required to have disease progression on one or two prior lines of endocrine therapy, including one line containing a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Eligible patients could have received up to one prior line of chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic setting. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive ORSERDU 345 mg orally once daily (n=239), or investigator’s choice of endocrine therapy (n=239), which included fulvestrant (n=166), or an aromatase inhibitor (n=73; anastrozole, letrozole or exemestane). Randomization was stratified by ESR1 mutation status (detected vs not detected), prior treatment with fulvestrant (yes vs no), and visceral metastasis (yes vs no). ESR1 mutational status was determined by blood circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) using the Guardant360 CDx assay and was limited to ESR1 missense mutations in the ligand binding domain (between codons 310 to 547). Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome was progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by a blinded imaging review committee (BIRC). An additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). A statistically significant difference in PFS was observed in the intention to treat (ITT) population and in the subgroup of patients with ESR1 mutations. An exploratory analysis of PFS in the 250 (52%) patients without ESR1 mutations showed a HR 0.86 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.19) indicating that the improvement in the ITT population was primarily attributed to the results seen in the ESR1 mutated population. Among the patients with ESR1 mutations (n=228), the median age was 63 years (range: 28-89); 100% were female; 72% were White, 5.7% Asian, 3.5% Black, 0.4% Other, 18.4% unknown/not reported; 8.8% were Hispanic/Latino; and baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (57%) or 1 (43%). Most patients had visceral disease (71%); 62% had received 1 line of endocrine therapy and 39% had received 2 lines of endocrine therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting.
