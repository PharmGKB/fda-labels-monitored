(7.1)Strong CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid concomitant use with BALVERSA. (7.1)Moderate CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inducers: Increase BALVERSA dose up to 9 mg. (7.1)Serum phosphate level-altering agents: Avoid concomitant use with agents that can alter serum phosphate levels before the initial dose modification period. (2.3, 7.1)CYP3A4 substrates: Avoid concomitant use with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices. (7.2)OCT2 substrates: Consider alternative agents or consider reducing the dose of OCT2 substrates based on tolerability. (7.2)P-gp substrates: Separate BALVERSA administration by at least 6 hours before or after administration of P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic indices. (7.2)7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on BALVERSATable 5 summarizes drug interactions that affect the exposure of BALVERSA or serum phosphate level and their clinical management.Table 5: Drug Interactions that Affect BALVERSAModerate CYP2C9 or Strong CYP3A4 InhibitorsClinical ImpactCo-administration of BALVERSA with moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased erdafitinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Increased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to increased drug-related toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].Clinical ManagementConsider alternative therapies that are not moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors during treatment with BALVERSA.If co-administration of moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable, monitor closely for adverse reactions and consider dose modifications accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. If the moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the BALVERSA dose may be increased in the absence of drug-related toxicity.Strong CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 InducersClinical ImpactCo-administration of BALVERSA with strong inducers of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 may decrease erdafitinib plasma concentrations significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to decreased activity.Clinical ManagementAvoid co-administration of strong inducers of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 with BALVERSA.Moderate CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 InducersClinical ImpactCo-administration of BALVERSA with moderate inducers of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 may decrease erdafitinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to decreased activity.Clinical ManagementIf a moderate CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered at the start of BALVERSA treatment, administer BALVERSA dose as recommended (8 mg once daily with potential to increase to 9 mg once daily based on serum phosphate levels on Days 14 to 21 and tolerability).If a moderate CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered after the initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels and tolerability, increase BALVERSA dose up to 9 mg.When a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 is discontinued, continue BALVERSA at the same dose, in the absence of drug-related toxicity.Serum Phosphate Level-Altering AgentsClinical ImpactCo-administration of BALVERSA with other serum phosphate level-altering agents may increase or decrease serum phosphate levels [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2)].Changes in serum phosphate levels due to serum phosphate level-altering agents (other than erdafitinib) may interfere with serum phosphate levels needed for the determination of initial dose increased based on serum phosphate levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].Clinical ManagementAvoid co-administration of serum phosphate level-altering agents with BALVERSA before initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels (Days 14 to 21) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].7.2 Effect of BALVERSA on Other DrugsTable 6 summarizes the effect of BALVERSA on other drugs and their clinical management.Table 6: BALVERSA Drug Interactions that Affect Other DrugsCYP3A4 SubstratesClinical ImpactCo-administration of BALVERSA with CYP3A4 substrates may alter the plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Altered plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates may lead to loss of activity or increased toxicity of the CYP3A4 substrates.Clinical ManagementAvoid co-administration of BALVERSA with sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 with narrow therapeutic indices.OCT2 SubstratesClinical ImpactCo-administration of BALVERSA with OCT2 substrates may increase the plasma concentrations of OCT2 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Increased plasma concentrations of OCT2 substrates may lead to increased toxicity of the OCT2 substrates.Clinical ManagementConsider alternative therapies that are not OCT2 substrates or consider reducing the dose of OCT2 substrates (e.g., metformin) based on tolerability.P-glycoprotein (P-gp) SubstratesClinical ImpactCo-administration of BALVERSA with P-gp substrates may increase the plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Increased plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates may lead to increased toxicity of the P-gp substrates.Clinical ManagementIf co-administration of BALVERSA with P-gp substrates is unavoidable, separate BALVERSA administration by at least 6 hours before or after administration of P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic index."

        "12.2 PharmacodynamicsCardiac ElectrophysiologyBased on evaluation of QTc interval in an open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study in 187 patients with cancer, erdafitinib had no large effect (i.e., > 20 ms) on the QTc interval.Serum PhosphateErdafitinib increased serum phosphate level as a consequence of FGFR inhibition. BALVERSA should be increased to the maximum recommended dose to achieve target serum phosphate levels of 5.5–7.0 mg/dL in early cycles with continuous daily dosing [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].In erdafitinib clinical trials, the use of drugs which can increase serum phosphate levels, such as potassium phosphate supplements, vitamin D supplements, antacids, phosphate-containing enemas or laxatives, and medications known to have phosphate as an excipient were prohibited unless no alternatives exist. To manage phosphate elevation, phosphate binders were permitted. Avoid concomitant use with agents that can alter serum phosphate levels before the initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Erdafitinib is a kinase inhibitor that binds to and inhibits enzymatic activity of FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4 based on in vitro data. Erdafitinib also binds to RET, CSF1R, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FLT4, KIT, and VEGFR2. Erdafitinib inhibited FGFR phosphorylation and signaling and decreased cell viability in cell lines expressing FGFR genetic alterations, including point mutations, amplifications, and fusions. Erdafitinib demonstrated antitumor activity in FGFR-expressing cell lines and xenograft models derived from tumor types, including bladder cancer."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 PharmacokineticsFollowing administration of 8 mg once daily, the mean (coefficient of variation [CV%]) erdafitinib steady-state maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUCtau), and minimum observed plasma concentration (Cmin) were 1,399 ng/mL (51%), 29,268 ng∙h/mL (60%), and 936 ng/mL (65%), respectively.Following single and repeat once daily dosing, erdafitinib exposure (maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax] and area under the plasma concentration time curve [AUC]) increased proportionally across the dose range of 0.5 to 12 mg (0.06 to 1.3 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Steady state was achieved after 2 weeks with once daily dosing and the mean accumulation ratio was 4-fold. AbsorptionMedian time to achieve peak plasma concentration (tmax) was 2.5 hours (range: 2 to 6 hours). Effect of FoodNo clinically meaningful differences with erdafitinib pharmacokinetics were observed following administration of a high-fat and high-calorie meal (800 calories to 1,000 calories with approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal from fat) in healthy subjects.DistributionThe mean apparent volume of distribution of erdafitinib was 29 L in patients. Erdafitinib protein binding was 99.8% in patients, primarily to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. EliminationThe mean total apparent clearance (CL/F) of erdafitinib was 0.362 L/h in patients.The mean effective half-life of erdafitinib was 59 hours in patients.MetabolismErdafitinib is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in the total clearance of erdafitinib is estimated to be 39% and 20% respectively. Unchanged erdafitinib was the major drug-related moiety in plasma, there were no circulating metabolites.ExcretionFollowing a single oral dose of radiolabeled erdafitinib, approximately 69% of the dose was recovered in feces (19% as unchanged) and 19% in urine (13% as unchanged). Specific PopulationsNo clinically meaningful trends in the pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib were observed based on age (21–88 years), sex, race, body weight (36–132 kg), mild (eGFR [estimated glomerular filtration rate, using modification of diet in renal disease equation] 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0–1.5 × ULN and any AST). The pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib in patients with severe renal impairment, renal impairment requiring dialysis, moderate or severe hepatic impairment is unknown.Drug Interaction StudiesClinical Studies and Model-Based Approaches Moderate CYP2C9 Inhibitors:Erdafitinib mean ratios (90% CI) for Cmax and AUCinf were 121% (99.9, 147) and 148% (120, 182), respectively, when co-administered with fluconazole, a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitor, relative to erdafitinib alone. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:Erdafitinib mean ratios (90% CI) for Cmax and AUCinf were 105% (86.7, 127) and 134% (109, 164), respectively, when co-administered with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp inhibitor) relative to erdafitinib alone. Strong CYP3A4/2C9 Inducers:Simulations suggested that rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4/2C9 inducer) may significantly decrease erdafitinib Cmax and AUC. In Vitro StudiesCYP Substrates:Erdafitinib is a time dependent inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4. The effect of erdafitinib on a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate is unknown. Erdafitinib is not an inhibitor of other major CYP isozymes at clinically relevant concentrations.Transporters:Erdafitinib is a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp. P-gp inhibitors are not expected to affect erdafitinib exposure to a clinically relevant extent. Erdafitinib is an inhibitor of OCT2.Erdafitinib does not inhibit BCRP, OATP1B, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, MATE-1, or MATE-2K at clinically relevant concentrations.Acid-Lowering Agents: Erdafitinib has adequate solubility across the pH range of 1 to 7.4. Acid-lowering agents (e.g., antacids, H2-antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) are not expected to affect the bioavailability of erdafitinib."

        "8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryBased on the mechanism of action and findings in animal reproduction studies, BALVERSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available data on BALVERSA use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Oral administration of erdafitinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused malformations and embryo-fetal death at maternal exposures that were less than the human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC (see Data). Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.DataAnimal DataIn an embryo-fetal toxicity study, erdafitinib was orally administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis. Doses ≥4mg/kg/day (at total maternal exposures <0.1% of total human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC) produced embryo-fetal death, major blood vessel malformations and other vascular anomalies, limb malformations (ectrodactyly, absent or misshapen long bones), an increased incidence of skeletal anomalies in multiple bones (vertebrae, sternebrae, ribs), and decreased fetal weight."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSOcular disorders: BALVERSA can cause central serous retinopathy/retinal pigment epithelial detachment (CSR/RPED). Perform monthly ophthalmological examinations during the first four months of treatment, every 3 months afterwards, and at any time for visual symptoms. Withhold BALVERSA when CSR/RPED occurs and permanently discontinue if it does not resolve within 4 weeks or if Grade 4 in severity. (2.3, 5.1)Hyperphosphatemia: Increases in phosphate levels are a pharmacodynamic effect of BALVERSA. Monitor for hyperphosphatemia and manage with dose modifications when required. (2.3, 5.2)Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception (5.3, 8.1, 8.3).5.1 Ocular DisordersBALVERSA can cause ocular disorders, including central serous retinopathy/retinal pigment epithelial detachment (CSR/RPED) resulting in visual field defect.CSR/RPED was reported in 25% of patients treated with BALVERSA, with a median time to first onset of 50 days. Grade 3 CSR/RPED, involving central field of vision, was reported in 3% of patients. CSR/RPED resolved in 13% of patients and was ongoing in 13% of patients at the study cutoff. CSR/RPED led to dose interruptions and reductions in 9% and 14% of patients, respectively and 3% of patients discontinued BALVERSA.Dry eye symptoms occurred in 28% of patients during treatment with BALVERSA and were Grade 3 in 6% of patients. All patients should receive dry eye prophylaxis with ocular demulcents as needed.Perform monthly ophthalmological examinations during the first 4 months of treatment and every 3 months afterwards, and urgently at any time for visual symptoms. Ophthalmological examination should include assessment of visual acuity, slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, and optical coherence tomography.Withhold BALVERSA when CSR occurs and permanently discontinue if it does not resolve within 4 weeks or if Grade 4 in severity. For ocular adverse reactions, follow the dose modification guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].5.2 HyperphosphatemiaIncreases in phosphate levels are a pharmacodynamic effect of BALVERSA [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2)]. Hyperphosphatemia was reported as adverse reaction in 76% of patients treated with BALVERSA. The median onset time for any grade event of hyperphosphatemia was 20 days (range: 8 –116) after initiating BALVERSA. Thirty-two percent of patients received phosphate binders during treatment with BALVERSA. Monitor for hyperphosphatemia and follow the dose modification guidelines when required [see Dosage and Administration 2.2, 2.3].5.3 Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on the mechanism of action and findings in animal reproduction studies, BALVERSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an embryo-fetal toxicity study, oral administration of erdafitinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused malformations and embryo-fetal death at maternal exposures that were less than the human exposures at the maximum human recommended dose based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]."

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONConfirm the presence of FGFR genetic alterations in tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with BALVERSA. (2.1)Recommended initial dosage: 8 mg orally once daily with a dose increase to 9 mg daily if criteria are met. (2.2)Swallow whole with or without food. (2.2)2.1 Patient SelectionSelect patients for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with BALVERSA based on the presence of susceptible FGFR genetic alterations in tumor specimens as detected by an FDA-approved companion diagnostic [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of FGFR genetic alterations in urothelial cancer is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.2.2 Recommended Dosage and ScheduleThe recommended starting dose of BALVERSA is 8 mg (two 4 mg tablets) orally once daily, with a dose increase to 9 mg (three 3 mg tablets) once daily based on serum phosphate (PO4) levels and tolerability at 14 to 21 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].Swallow tablets whole with or without food. If vomiting occurs any time after taking BALVERSA, the next dose should be taken the next day. Treatment should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.If a dose of BALVERSA is missed, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day. Resume the regular daily dose schedule for BALVERSA the next day. Extra tablets should not be taken to make up for the missed dose.Dose Increase based on Serum Phosphate LevelsAssess serum phosphate levels 14 to 21 days after initiating treatment. Increase the dose of BALVERSA to 9 mg once daily if serum phosphate level is < 5.5 mg/dL and there are no ocular disorders or Grade 2 or greater adverse reactions. Monitor phosphate levels monthly for hyperphosphatemia [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2)].2.3 Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions are listed in Table 1.Table 1: BALVERSA Dose Reduction ScheduleDose1st dose reduction2nd dose reduction3rd dose reduction4th dose reduction5th dose reduction9 mg ⭢ (three 3 mg tablets)8 mg (two 4 mg tablets)6 mg (two 3 mg tablets)5 mg (one 5 mg tablet)4 mg (one 4 mg tablet)Stop 8 mg ⭢ (two 4 mg tablets)6 mg (two 3 mg tablets)5 mg (one 5 mg tablet)4 mg (one 4 mg tablet)StopTable 2 summarizes recommendations for dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of BALVERSA in the management of specific adverse reactions.Table 2: Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions Adverse ReactionBALVERSA Dose ModificationHyperphosphatemiaIn all patients, restrict phosphate intake to 600–800 mg daily.

Patients were treated with BALVERSA at 8 mg orally once daily; with a dose increase to 9 mg in patients with phosphate levels <5.5 mg/dL on Day 14 of Cycle 1. Median duration of treatment was 5.3 months (range: 0 to 17 months). The most common adverse reactions (ARs) including laboratory abnormalities (≥20%) were phosphate increased, stomatitis, fatigue, creatinine increased, diarrhea, dry mouth, onycholysis, alanine aminotransferase increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, sodium decreased, decreased appetite, albumin decreased, dysgeusia, hemoglobin decreased, dry skin, aspartate aminotransferase increased, magnesium decreased, dry eye, alopecia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, constipation, phosphate decreased, abdominal pain, calcium increased, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain. The most common Grade 3 or greater ARs (>1%) were stomatitis, nail dystrophy, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, paronychia, nail disorder, keratitis, onycholysis, and hyperphosphatemia. An adverse reaction with a fatal outcome in 1% of patients was acute myocardial infarction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients including eye disorders (10%).Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequent reasons for permanent discontinuation included eye disorders (6%).Dosage interruptions occurred in 68% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption included hyperphosphatemia (24%), stomatitis (17%), eye disorders (17%), and palmar-plantar erythro-dysaesthesia syndrome (8%).Dose reductions occurred in 53% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions for dose reductions included eye disorders (23%), stomatitis (15%), hyperphosphatemia (7%), palmar-plantar erythro-dysaesthesia syndrome (7%), paronychia (7%), and nail dystrophy (6%).Table 3 presents ARs reported in ≥10% of patients treated with BALVERSA at 8 mg once daily.Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 10% (Any Grade) or ≥5% (Grade 3–4) of PatientsBALVERSA 8 mg daily (N=87)Adverse ReactionAll Grades (%)Grade 3–4 (%)Any 10067Gastrointestinal disorders9224 Stomatitis569 Diarrhea472 Dry mouth450 Constipation281 Abdominal painIncludes abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain upper, and abdominal pain lower232 Nausea211 Vomiting132Metabolism and nutrition disorders9016 Decreased appetite380General disorders and admin. site conditions6913 FatigueIncludes asthenia, fatigue, lethargy, and malaise5410 Pyrexia141Skin and subcutaneous disorders7516 OnycholysisIncludes onycholysis, onychoclasis, nail disorder, nail dystrophy, and nail ridging4110 Dry skinIncludes dry skin and xerostomia340 Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia266 Alopecia260 Nail discoloration110Eye disorders6211 Dry eyeIncludes dry eye, xerophthalmia, keratitis, foreign body sensation, and corneal erosion286 Vision blurred170 Lacrimation increased100Nervous system disorders575 Dysgeusia 371Infections and infestations5620 Paronychia173 Urinary tract infection176 Conjunctivitis110Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders407 Oropharyngeal pain111 DyspneaIncludes dyspnea and dyspnea exertional102Renal and urinary tract disorders3810 Hematuria112Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders310 Musculoskeletal painIncludes back pain, musculoskeletal discomfort, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, neck pain, pain in extremity200 Arthralgia110Investigations445 Weight decreasedIncludes weight decreased and cachexia160Table 4: Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in ≥ 10% (All Grade) or ≥ 5% (Grade 3–4) of Patients BALVERSA 8 mg daily (N=86One of the 87 patients had no laboratory tests.)Laboratory AbnormalityAll Grades (%)Grade 3–4 (%)Hematology Hemoglobin decreased353 Platelets decreased191 Leukocytes decreased170 Neutrophils decreased102Chemistry Phosphate increased761 Creatinine increased525 Sodium decreased4016 Alanine aminotransferase increased411 Alkaline phosphatase increased411 Albumin decreased370 Aspartate aminotransferase increased300 Magnesium decreased301 Phosphate decreased249 Calcium increased223 Potassium increased160 Fasting glucose increased100"

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSLactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2)8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryBased on the mechanism of action and findings in animal reproduction studies, BALVERSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There are no available data on BALVERSA use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Oral administration of erdafitinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused malformations and embryo-fetal death at maternal exposures that were less than the human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC (see Data). Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.DataAnimal DataIn an embryo-fetal toxicity study, erdafitinib was orally administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis. Doses ≥4mg/kg/day (at total maternal exposures <0.1% of total human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC) produced embryo-fetal death, major blood vessel malformations and other vascular anomalies, limb malformations (ectrodactyly, absent or misshapen long bones), an increased incidence of skeletal anomalies in multiple bones (vertebrae, sternebrae, ribs), and decreased fetal weight. 8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of erdafitinib in human milk, or the effects of erdafitinib on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from erdafitinib in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month following the last dose.8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialPregnancy TestingPregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with BALVERSA.ContraceptionFemalesBALVERSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Population (8.1)].MalesAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].InfertilityFemalesBased on findings from animal studies, BALVERSA may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness of BALVERSA in pediatric patients have not been established.In 4 and 13-week repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs, toxicities in bone and teeth were observed at an exposure less than the human exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Chondroid dysplasia/metaplasia were reported in multiple bones in both species, and tooth abnormalities included abnormal/irregular denting in rats and dogs and discoloration and degeneration of odontoblasts in rats.8.5 Geriatric UseOf the 416 patients treated with BALVERSA in clinical studies, 45% were 65 years of age or older, and 12% were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14)].8.6 CYP2C9 Poor MetabolizersCYP2C9*3/*3 Genotype: Erdafitinib plasma concentrations were predicted to be higher in patients with the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype.

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES14.1 Urothelial Carcinoma with Susceptible FGFR Genetic AlterationsStudy BLC2001 (NCT02365597) was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BALVERSA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutation status for screening and enrollment of patients was determined by a clinical trial assay (CTA). The efficacy population consists of a cohort of eighty-seven patients who were enrolled in this study with disease that had progressed on or after at least one prior chemotherapy and that had at least 1 of the following genetic alterations: FGFR3 gene mutations (R248C, S249C, G370C, Y373C) or FGFR gene fusions (FGFR3-TACC3, FGFR3-BAIAP2L1, FGFR2-BICC1, FGFR2-CASP7), as determined by the CTA performed at a central laboratory. Tumor samples from 69 patients were tested retrospectively by the QIAGEN therascreen® FGFR RGQ RT-PCR Kit, which is the FDA-approved test for selection of patients with mUC for BALVERSA.Patients received a starting dose of BALVERSA at 8 mg once daily with a dose increase to 9 mg once daily in patients whose serum phosphate levels were below the target of 5.5 mg/dL between days 14 and 17; a dose increase occurred in 41% of patients. BALVERSA was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR), as determined by blinded independent review committee (BIRC) according to RECIST v1.1.The median age was 67 years (range: 36 to 87 years), 79% were male, and 74% were Caucasian. Most patients (92%) had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Sixty-six percent of patients had visceral metastases. Eighty-four (97%) patients received at least one of cisplatin or carboplatin previously. Fifty-six percent of patients only received prior cisplatin-based regimens, 29% received only prior carboplatin-based regimens, and 10% received both cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens. Three (3%) patients had disease progression following prior platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy only. Twenty-four percent of patients had been treated with prior anti PD-L1/PD-1 therapy.Efficacy results are summarized in Table 7 and Table 8. Overall response rate was 32.2%.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY12.1 Mechanism of Action Erdafitinib is a kinase inhibitor that binds to and inhibits enzymatic activity of FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4 based on in vitro data. Erdafitinib also binds to RET, CSF1R, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FLT4, KIT, and VEGFR2. Erdafitinib inhibited FGFR phosphorylation and signaling and decreased cell viability in cell lines expressing FGFR genetic alterations, including point mutations, amplifications, and fusions. Erdafitinib demonstrated antitumor activity in FGFR-expressing cell lines and xenograft models derived from tumor types, including bladder cancer.12.2 PharmacodynamicsCardiac ElectrophysiologyBased on evaluation of QTc interval in an open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study in 187 patients with cancer, erdafitinib had no large effect (i.e., > 20 ms) on the QTc interval.Serum PhosphateErdafitinib increased serum phosphate level as a consequence of FGFR inhibition. BALVERSA should be increased to the maximum recommended dose to achieve target serum phosphate levels of 5.5–7.0 mg/dL in early cycles with continuous daily dosing [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].In erdafitinib clinical trials, the use of drugs which can increase serum phosphate levels, such as potassium phosphate supplements, vitamin D supplements, antacids, phosphate-containing enemas or laxatives, and medications known to have phosphate as an excipient were prohibited unless no alternatives exist. To manage phosphate elevation, phosphate binders were permitted. Avoid concomitant use with agents that can alter serum phosphate levels before the initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].12.3 PharmacokineticsFollowing administration of 8 mg once daily, the mean (coefficient of variation [CV%]) erdafitinib steady-state maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUCtau), and minimum observed plasma concentration (Cmin) were 1,399 ng/mL (51%), 29,268 ng∙h/mL (60%), and 936 ng/mL (65%), respectively.Following single and repeat once daily dosing, erdafitinib exposure (maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax] and area under the plasma concentration time curve [AUC]) increased proportionally across the dose range of 0.5 to 12 mg (0.06 to 1.3 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Steady state was achieved after 2 weeks with once daily dosing and the mean accumulation ratio was 4-fold. AbsorptionMedian time to achieve peak plasma concentration (tmax) was 2.5 hours (range: 2 to 6 hours). Effect of FoodNo clinically meaningful differences with erdafitinib pharmacokinetics were observed following administration of a high-fat and high-calorie meal (800 calories to 1,000 calories with approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal from fat) in healthy subjects.DistributionThe mean apparent volume of distribution of erdafitinib was 29 L in patients. Erdafitinib protein binding was 99.8% in patients, primarily to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. EliminationThe mean total apparent clearance (CL/F) of erdafitinib was 0.362 L/h in patients.The mean effective half-life of erdafitinib was 59 hours in patients.MetabolismErdafitinib is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in the total clearance of erdafitinib is estimated to be 39% and 20% respectively. Unchanged erdafitinib was the major drug-related moiety in plasma, there were no circulating metabolites.ExcretionFollowing a single oral dose of radiolabeled erdafitinib, approximately 69% of the dose was recovered in feces (19% as unchanged) and 19% in urine (13% as unchanged). Specific PopulationsNo clinically meaningful trends in the pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib were observed based on age (21–88 years), sex, race, body weight (36–132 kg), mild (eGFR [estimated glomerular filtration rate, using modification of diet in renal disease equation] 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0–1.5 × ULN and any AST). The pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib in patients with severe renal impairment, renal impairment requiring dialysis, moderate or severe hepatic impairment is unknown.Drug Interaction StudiesClinical Studies and Model-Based Approaches Moderate CYP2C9 Inhibitors:Erdafitinib mean ratios (90% CI) for Cmax and AUCinf were 121% (99.9, 147) and 148% (120, 182), respectively, when co-administered with fluconazole, a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitor, relative to erdafitinib alone. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:Erdafitinib mean ratios (90% CI) for Cmax and AUCinf were 105% (86.7, 127) and 134% (109, 164), respectively, when co-administered with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp inhibitor) relative to erdafitinib alone. Strong CYP3A4/2C9 Inducers:Simulations suggested that rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4/2C9 inducer) may significantly decrease erdafitinib Cmax and AUC. In Vitro StudiesCYP Substrates:Erdafitinib is a time dependent inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4. The effect of erdafitinib on a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate is unknown. Erdafitinib is not an inhibitor of other major CYP isozymes at clinically relevant concentrations.Transporters:Erdafitinib is a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp. P-gp inhibitors are not expected to affect erdafitinib exposure to a clinically relevant extent. Erdafitinib is an inhibitor of OCT2.Erdafitinib does not inhibit BCRP, OATP1B, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, MATE-1, or MATE-2K at clinically relevant concentrations.Acid-Lowering Agents: Erdafitinib has adequate solubility across the pH range of 1 to 7.4. Acid-lowering agents (e.g., antacids, H2-antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) are not expected to affect the bioavailability of erdafitinib. 12.5 PharmacogenomicsCYP2C9 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic variants, such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms. Erdafitinib exposure was similar in subjects with CYP2C9*1/*2 and *1/*3 genotypes relative to subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype (wild type). No data are available in subjects characterized by other genotypes (e.g., *2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3). Simulation suggested no clinically meaningful differences in erdafitinib exposure in subjects with CYP2C9*2/*2 and *2/*3 genotypes.
