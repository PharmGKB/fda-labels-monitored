        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Confirm the presence of FGFR genetic alterations in tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with BALVERSA. ( 2.1 ) Recommended initial dosage: 8 mg orally once daily with a dose increase to 9 mg daily if criteria are met. ( 2.2 ) Swallow whole with or without food. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with BALVERSA based on the presence of susceptible FGFR genetic alterations in tumor specimens as detected by an FDA-approved companion diagnostic [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of FGFR genetic alterations in urothelial cancer is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics . 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Schedule The recommended starting dose of BALVERSA is 8 mg (two 4 mg tablets) orally once daily, with a dose increase to 9 mg (three 3 mg tablets) once daily based on serum phosphate (PO 4 ) levels and tolerability at 14 to 21 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Swallow tablets whole with or without food. If vomiting occurs any time after taking BALVERSA, the next dose should be taken the next day. Treatment should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. If a dose of BALVERSA is missed, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day. Resume the regular daily dose schedule for BALVERSA the next day. Extra tablets should not be taken to make up for the missed dose. Dose Increase based on Serum Phosphate Levels Assess serum phosphate levels 14 to 21 days after initiating treatment. Increase the dose of BALVERSA to 9 mg once daily if serum phosphate level is < 5.5 mg/dL and there are no ocular disorders or Grade 2 or greater adverse reactions. Monitor phosphate levels monthly for hyperphosphatemia [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2) ] . 2.3 Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions are listed in Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ocular disorders: BALVERSA can cause central serous retinopathy/retinal pigment epithelial detachment (CSR/RPED). Perform monthly ophthalmological examinations during the first four months of treatment, every 3 months afterwards, and at any time for visual symptoms. Withhold BALVERSA when CSR/RPED occurs and permanently discontinue if it does not resolve within 4 weeks or if Grade 4 in severity. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Hyperphosphatemia: Increases in phosphate levels are a pharmacodynamic effect of BALVERSA. Monitor for hyperphosphatemia and manage with dose modifications when required. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Ocular Disorders BALVERSA can cause ocular disorders, including central serous retinopathy/retinal pigment epithelial detachment (CSR/RPED) resulting in visual field defect. CSR/RPED was reported in 25% of patients treated with BALVERSA, with a median time to first onset of 50 days. Grade 3 CSR/RPED, involving central field of vision, was reported in 3% of patients. CSR/RPED resolved in 13% of patients and was ongoing in 13% of patients at the study cutoff. CSR/RPED led to dose interruptions and reductions in 9% and 14% of patients, respectively and 3% of patients discontinued BALVERSA. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 28% of patients during treatment with BALVERSA and were Grade 3 in 6% of patients. All patients should receive dry eye prophylaxis with ocular demulcents as needed. Perform monthly ophthalmological examinations during the first 4 months of treatment and every 3 months afterwards, and urgently at any time for visual symptoms. Ophthalmological examination should include assessment of visual acuity, slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, and optical coherence tomography. Withhold BALVERSA when CSR occurs and permanently discontinue if it does not resolve within 4 weeks or if Grade 4 in severity. For ocular adverse reactions, follow the dose modification guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.2 Hyperphosphatemia and Soft Tissue Mineralization BALVERSA can cause hyperphosphatemia leading to soft tissue mineralization, cutaneous calcinosis, non-uremic calciphylaxis and vascular calcification. Increases in phosphate levels are a pharmacodynamic effect of BALVERSA [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2) ]. Hyperphosphatemia was reported as adverse reaction in 76% of patients treated with BALVERSA. The median onset time for any grade event of hyperphosphatemia was 20 days (range: 8–116) after initiating BALVERSA. Thirty-two percent of patients received phosphate binders during treatment with BALVERSA. Cutaneous calcinosis, non-uremic calciphylaxis and vascular calcification have been observed in 0.3% of patients treated with BALVERSA. Monitor for hyperphosphatemia throughout treatment. In all patients, restrict phosphate intake to 600–800 mg daily. If serum phosphate is above 7.0 mg/dL, consider adding an oral phosphate binder until serum phosphate level returns to <5.5 mg/dL. Withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue BALVERSA based on duration and severity of hyperphosphatemia according to Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animal reproduction studies, BALVERSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an embryo-fetal toxicity study, oral administration of erdafitinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused malformations and embryo-fetal death at maternal exposures that were less than the human exposures at the maximum human recommended dose based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are also described elsewhere in the labeling: Ocular Disorders [see Warning and Precautions (5.1) ] . Hyperphosphatemia [see Warning and Precautions (5.2) ] . The most common adverse reactions including laboratory abnormalities (≥20%) were phosphate increased, stomatitis, fatigue, creatinine increased, diarrhea, dry mouth, nail disorder, alanine aminotransferase increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, sodium decreased, decreased appetite, albumin decreased, dysgeusia, hemoglobin decreased, dry skin, aspartate aminotransferase increased, magnesium decreased, dry eye, alopecia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, constipation, phosphate decreased, abdominal pain, calcium increased, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Products, LP. at 1-800-526-7736 (1-800-JANSSEN and www.BALVERSA.com) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of BALVERSA was evaluated in the BLC2001 study that included 87 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma which had susceptible FGFR3 or FGFR2 genetic alterations, and which progressed during or following at least one line of prior chemotherapy including within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients were treated with BALVERSA at 8 mg orally once daily; with a dose increase to 9 mg in patients with phosphate levels <5.5 mg/dL on Day 14 of Cycle 1. Median duration of treatment was 5.3 months (range: 0 to 17 months). The most common adverse reactions (ARs) including laboratory abnormalities (≥20%) were phosphate increased, stomatitis, fatigue, creatinine increased, diarrhea, dry mouth, nail disorder, alanine aminotransferase increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, sodium decreased, decreased appetite, albumin decreased, dysgeusia, hemoglobin decreased, dry skin, aspartate aminotransferase increased, magnesium decreased, dry eye, alopecia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, constipation, phosphate decreased, abdominal pain, calcium increased, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain. The most common Grade 3 or greater ARs (>1%) were stomatitis, nail dystrophy, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, paronychia, nail disorder, keratitis, and hyperphosphatemia. An adverse reaction with a fatal outcome in 1% of patients was acute myocardial infarction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients including eye disorders (10%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequent reasons for permanent discontinuation included eye disorders (6%). Dosage interruptions occurred in 68% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption included hyperphosphatemia (24%), stomatitis (17%), eye disorders (17%), and palmar-plantar erythro-dysesthesia syndrome (8%). Dose reductions occurred in 53% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions for dose reductions included eye disorders (23%), stomatitis (15%), hyperphosphatemia (7%), palmar-plantar erythro-dysesthesia syndrome (7%), paronychia (7%), and nail dystrophy (6%).

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Consider alternative agents or monitor closely for adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid concomitant use with BALVERSA. ( 7.1 ) Moderate CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inducers: Increase BALVERSA dose up to 9 mg. ( 7.1 ) Serum phosphate level-altering agents: Avoid concomitant use with agents that can alter serum phosphate levels before the initial dose modification period. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) CYP3A4 substrates: Avoid concomitant use with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices. ( 7.2 ) OCT2 substrates: Consider alternative agents or consider reducing the dose of OCT2 substrates based on tolerability. ( 7.2 ) P-gp substrates: Separate BALVERSA administration by at least 6 hours before or after administration of P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic indices. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on BALVERSA Table 5 summarizes drug interactions that affect the exposure of BALVERSA or serum phosphate level and their clinical management. Table 5: Drug Interactions that Affect BALVERSA Moderate CYP2C9 or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased erdafitinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Increased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to increased drug-related toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Clinical Management Consider alternative therapies that are not moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors during treatment with BALVERSA. If co-administration of a moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable, monitor closely for adverse reactions and consider dose modifications accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. If the moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the BALVERSA dose may be increased in the absence of drug-related toxicity. Strong CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with strong inducers of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 may decrease erdafitinib plasma concentrations significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to decreased activity. Clinical Management Avoid co-administration of strong inducers of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 with BALVERSA. Moderate CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with moderate inducers of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 may decrease erdafitinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to decreased activity. Clinical Management If a moderate CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered at the start of BALVERSA treatment, administer BALVERSA dose as recommended (8 mg once daily with potential to increase to 9 mg once daily based on serum phosphate levels on Days 14 to 21 and tolerability). If a moderate CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered after the initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels and tolerability, increase BALVERSA dose up to 9 mg. When a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 is discontinued, continue BALVERSA at the same dose, in the absence of drug-related toxicity. Serum Phosphate Level-Altering Agents Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with other serum phosphate level-altering agents may increase or decrease serum phosphate levels [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2) ]. Changes in serum phosphate levels due to serum phosphate level-altering agents (other than erdafitinib) may interfere with serum phosphate levels needed for the determination of initial dose increased based on serum phosphate levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Clinical Management Avoid co-administration of serum phosphate level-altering agents with BALVERSA before initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels (Days 14 to 21) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 7.2 Effect of BALVERSA on Other Drugs Table 6 summarizes the effect of BALVERSA on other drugs and their clinical management. Table 6: BALVERSA Drug Interactions that Affect Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with CYP3A4 substrates may alter the plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Altered plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates may lead to loss of activity or increased toxicity of the CYP3A4 substrates. Clinical Management Avoid co-administration of BALVERSA with sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 with narrow therapeutic indices. OCT2 Substrates Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with OCT2 substrates may increase the plasma concentrations of OCT2 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Increased plasma concentrations of OCT2 substrates may lead to increased toxicity of the OCT2 substrates. Clinical Management Consider alternative therapies that are not OCT2 substrates or consider reducing the dose of OCT2 substrates (e.g., metformin) based on tolerability. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with P-gp substrates may increase the plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Increased plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates may lead to increased toxicity of the P-gp substrates. Clinical Management If co-administration of BALVERSA with P-gp substrates is unavoidable, separate BALVERSA administration by at least 6 hours before or after administration of P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic index."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animal reproduction studies, BALVERSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no available data on BALVERSA use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Oral administration of erdafitinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused malformations and embryo-fetal death at maternal exposures that were less than the human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC (see Data ). Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal toxicity study, erdafitinib was orally administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis. Doses ≥4 mg/kg/day (at total maternal exposures <0.1% of total human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC) produced embryo-fetal death, major blood vessel malformations and other vascular anomalies, limb malformations (ectrodactyly, absent or misshapen long bones), an increased incidence of skeletal anomalies in multiple bones (vertebrae, sternebrae, ribs), and decreased fetal weight. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of erdafitinib in human milk, or the effects of erdafitinib on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from erdafitinib in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month following the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with BALVERSA. Contraception Females BALVERSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Population (8.1) ] . Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BALVERSA and for one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Infertility Females Based on findings from animal studies, BALVERSA may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of BALVERSA in pediatric patients have not been established. In 4 and 13-week repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs, toxicities in bone and teeth were observed at an exposure less than the human exposure (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Chondroid dysplasia/metaplasia were reported in multiple bones in both species, and tooth abnormalities included abnormal/irregular denting in rats and dogs and discoloration and degeneration of odontoblasts in rats. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 416 patients treated with BALVERSA in clinical studies, 45% were 65 years of age or older, and 12% were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ]. No data are available in patients with severe renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment. Limited data are available in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.8 CYP2C9 Poor Metabolizers CYP2C9*3/*3 Genotype: Erdafitinib plasma concentrations were predicted to be higher in patients with the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype. Monitor for increased adverse reactions in patients who are known or suspected to have CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype [see Pharmacogenomics (12.5) ] ."

Erdafitinib inhibited FGFR phosphorylation and signaling and decreased cell viability in cell lines expressing FGFR genetic alterations, including point mutations, amplifications, and fusions. Erdafitinib demonstrated antitumor activity in FGFR-expressing cell lines and xenograft models derived from tumor types, including bladder cancer. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology Based on evaluation of QTc interval in an open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study in 187 patients with cancer, erdafitinib had no large effect (i.e., > 20 ms) on the QTc interval. Serum Phosphate Erdafitinib increased serum phosphate level as a consequence of FGFR inhibition. BALVERSA should be increased to the maximum recommended dose to achieve target serum phosphate levels of 5.5–7.0 mg/dL in early cycles with continuous daily dosing [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. In erdafitinib clinical trials, the use of drugs which can increase serum phosphate levels, such as potassium phosphate supplements, vitamin D supplements, antacids, phosphate-containing enemas or laxatives, and medications known to have phosphate as an excipient were prohibited unless no alternatives exist. To manage phosphate elevation, phosphate binders were permitted. Avoid concomitant use with agents that can alter serum phosphate levels before the initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration of 8 mg once daily, the mean (coefficient of variation [CV%]) erdafitinib steady-state maximum observed plasma concentration (C max ), area under the curve (AUC tau ), and minimum observed plasma concentration (C min ) were 1,399 ng/mL (51%), 29,268 ng∙h/mL (60%), and 936 ng/mL (65%), respectively. Following single and repeat once daily dosing, erdafitinib exposure (maximum observed plasma concentration [C max ] and area under the plasma concentration time curve [AUC]) increased proportionally across the dose range of 0.5 to 12 mg (0.06 to 1.3 times the maximum approved recommended dose). Steady state was achieved after 2 weeks with once daily dosing and the mean accumulation ratio was 4-fold. Absorption Median time to achieve peak plasma concentration (t max ) was 2.5 hours (range: 2 to 6 hours). Effect of Food No clinically meaningful differences with erdafitinib pharmacokinetics were observed following administration of a high-fat and high-calorie meal (800 calories to 1,000 calories with approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal from fat) in healthy subjects. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution of erdafitinib was 29 L in patients. Erdafitinib protein binding was 99.8% in patients, primarily to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Elimination The mean total apparent clearance (CL/F) of erdafitinib was 0.362 L/h in patients. The mean effective half-life of erdafitinib was 59 hours in patients. Metabolism Erdafitinib is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in the total clearance of erdafitinib is estimated to be 39% and 20%, respectively. Unchanged erdafitinib was the major drug-related moiety in plasma, there were no circulating metabolites. Excretion Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled erdafitinib, approximately 69% of the dose was recovered in feces (19% as unchanged) and 19% in urine (13% as unchanged). Specific Populations No clinically meaningful trends in the pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib were observed based on age (21–88 years), sex, race, body weight (36–132 kg), mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, or mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Limited data are available in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of erdafitinib in patients with severe renal impairment and renal impairment requiring dialysis is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Based Approaches Moderate CYP2C9 Inhibitors: Erdafitinib mean ratios (90% CI) for C max and AUC inf were 121% (99.9, 147) and 148% (120, 182), respectively, when co-administered with fluconazole, a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitor, relative to erdafitinib alone. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Erdafitinib mean ratios (90% CI) for C max and AUC inf were 105% (86.7, 127) and 134% (109, 164), respectively, when co-administered with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and P-gp inhibitor) relative to erdafitinib alone. Strong CYP3A4/2C9 Inducers: Simulations suggested that rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4/2C9 inducer) may significantly decrease erdafitinib C max and AUC. In Vitro Studies CYP Substrates: Erdafitinib is a time dependent inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4. The effect of erdafitinib on a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate is unknown. Erdafitinib is not an inhibitor of other major CYP isozymes at clinically relevant concentrations. Transporters: Erdafitinib is a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp. P-gp inhibitors are not expected to affect erdafitinib exposure to a clinically relevant extent. Erdafitinib is an inhibitor of OCT2. Erdafitinib does not inhibit BCRP, OATP1B, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, MATE-1, or MATE-2K at clinically relevant concentrations. Acid-Lowering Agents: Erdafitinib has adequate solubility across the pH range of 1 to 7.4. Acid-lowering agents (e.g., antacids, H 2 -antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) are not expected to affect the bioavailability of erdafitinib. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic variants, such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms. Erdafitinib exposure was similar in subjects with CYP2C9*1/*2 and *1/*3 genotypes relative to subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype (wild type). No data are available in subjects characterized by other genotypes (e.g., *2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3). Simulation suggested no clinically meaningful differences in erdafitinib exposure in subjects with CYP2C9*2/*2 and *2/*3 genotypes. The exposure of erdafitinib is predicted to be 50% higher in subjects with the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype, estimated to be present in 0.4% to 3% of the population among various ethnic groups."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Urothelial Carcinoma with Susceptible FGFR Genetic Alterations Study BLC2001 (NCT02365597) was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BALVERSA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutation status for screening and enrollment of patients was determined by a clinical trial assay (CTA). The efficacy population consists of a cohort of eighty-seven patients who were enrolled in this study with disease that had progressed on or after at least one prior chemotherapy and that had at least 1 of the following genetic alterations: FGFR3 gene mutations (R248C, S249C, G370C, Y373C) or FGFR gene fusions (FGFR3-TACC3, FGFR3-BAIAP2L1, FGFR2-BICC1, FGFR2-CASP7), as determined by the CTA performed at a central laboratory. Tumor samples from 69 patients were tested retrospectively by the QIAGEN therascreen ® FGFR RGQ RT-PCR Kit, which is the FDA-approved test for selection of patients with mUC for BALVERSA. Patients received a starting dose of BALVERSA at 8 mg once daily with a dose increase to 9 mg once daily in patients whose serum phosphate levels were below the target of 5.5 mg/dL between days 14 and 17; a dose increase occurred in 41% of patients. BALVERSA was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR), as determined by blinded independent review committee (BIRC) according to RECIST v1.1. The median age was 67 years (range: 36 to 87 years), 79% were male, and 74% were Caucasian. Most patients (92%) had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Sixty-six percent of patients had visceral metastases. Eighty-four (97%) patients received at least one of cisplatin or carboplatin previously. Fifty-six percent of patients only received prior cisplatin-based regimens, 29% received only prior carboplatin-based regimens, and 10% received both cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens. Three (3%) patients had disease progression following prior platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy only. Twenty-four percent of patients had been treated with prior anti PD-L1/PD-1 therapy. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 7 and Table 8. Overall response rate was 32.2%. Responders included patients who had previously not responded to anti PD-L1/PD-1 therapy.

        "PATIENT INFORMATION BALVERSA ® (bal-VER-sah) (erdafitinib) tablets This Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised:01/2023 What is BALVERSA? BALVERSA is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with bladder cancer (urothelial cancer) that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery: which has a certain type of abnormal \"FGFR\" gene, and who have tried at least one other chemotherapy medicine that contains platinum, and it did not work or is no longer working. Your healthcare provider will test your cancer for certain types of abnormal FGFR genes and make sure that BALVERSA is right for you. It is not known if BALVERSA is safe and effective in children. Before taking BALVERSA tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have vision or eye problems. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. BALVERSA can harm your unborn baby. You should not become pregnant during treatment with BALVERSA. Females who can become pregnant: Your healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with BALVERSA. You should use effective birth control during treatment and for 1 month after the last dose of BALVERSA. Talk to your healthcare provider about birth control methods that may be right for you. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Males with female partners who can become pregnant: You should use effective birth control when sexually active during treatment with BALVERSA and for 1 month after the last dose. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Do not breastfeed during treatment and for 1 month after the last dose of BALVERSA. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take , including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How should I take BALVERSA? Take BALVERSA exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Take BALVERSA 1 time each day. Swallow BALVERSA tablets whole with or without food. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of BALVERSA, temporarily stop or completely stop treatment if you get certain side effects. If you miss a dose of BALVERSA, take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day. Take your regular dose of BALVERSA the next day. Do not take more BALVERSA than prescribed to make up for the missed dose. If you vomit after taking BALVERSA, do not take another BALVERSA tablet. Take your regular dose of BALVERSA the next day. What are the possible side effects of BALVERSA? BALVERSA may cause serious side effects, including: Eye problems. Eye problems are common with BALVERSA but can also be serious. Eye problems include dry or inflamed eyes, inflamed cornea (front part of the eye) and disorders of the retina, an internal part of the eye. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop blurred vision, loss of vision or other visual changes. You should use artificial tear substitutes, hydrating or lubricating eye gels or ointments at least every 2 hours during waking hours to help prevent dry eyes. During treatment with BALVERSA, your healthcare provider will send you to see an eye specialist. High phosphate levels in the blood (hyperphosphatemia). Hyperphosphatemia is common with BALVERSA but can also be serious. High levels of phosphate in your blood may lead to build-up of minerals such as calcium in different tissues in your body. Your healthcare provider will check your blood phosphate level between 14 and 21 days after starting treatment with BALVERSA, and then monthly. Your healthcare provider may prescribe changes in your diet or phosphate lowering therapy, or change or stop treatment with BALVERSA if needed. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop painful skin lesions, any muscle cramps, or numbness or tingling around your mouth. The most common side effects of BALVERSA include: mouth sores feeling tired change in kidney function diarrhea dry mouth nails separate from the bed or poor formation of the nail change in liver function low salt (sodium) levels decreased appetite change in sense of taste low red blood cells (anemia) dry skin dry eyes hair loss redness, swelling, peeling or tenderness, mainly on the hands or feet ('hand-foot syndrome') constipation stomach (abdominal) pain nausea muscle pain Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any nail or skin problems including nails separating from the nail bed, nail pain, nail bleeding, breaking of the nails, color or texture changes in your nails, infected skin around the nail, an itchy skin rash, dry skin, or cracks in the skin.
