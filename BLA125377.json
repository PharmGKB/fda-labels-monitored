        "8.5 Geriatric UseOf the 511 patients treated with YERVOY in Study MDX010-20 (unresectable or metastatic melanoma), 28% were 65 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients.Study CA184-029 (adjuvant treatment of melanoma) and CHECKMATE-142 (metastatic colorectal cancer) did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.Of the 550 patients randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab in CHECKMATE-214 (renal cell carcinoma), 38% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was observed between these patients and younger patients. In geriatric patients with intermediate or poor risk, no overall difference in effectiveness was observed.Of the 49 patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab in Cohort 4 of CHECKMATE-040 (hepatocellular carcinoma), 29% were between 65 years and 74 years of age and 8% were 75 years or older. Clinical studies of YERVOY in combination with nivolumab did not include sufficient numbers of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.Of the 576 patients randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in CHECKMATE-227 (NSCLC), 48% were 65 years or older and 10% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between older patients and younger patients; however, there was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older (29%) relative to all patients who received YERVOY with nivolumab (18%). Of the 396 patients in the primary efficacy population (PD-L1 ≥1%) randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with in CHECKMATE-227, the hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.89) in the 199 patients younger than 65 years compared to 0.91 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.15) in the 197 patients 65 years or older [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].Of the 361 patients randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in combination with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks and platinum-doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks (for 2 cycles) in CHECKMATE-9LA (NSCLC), 51% were 65 years or older and 10% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between older patients and younger patients; however, there was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older (43%) relative to all patients who received YERVOY with nivolumab and chemotherapy (24%). For patients aged 75 years or older who received chemotherapy only, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 16% relative to all patients who had a discontinuation rate of 13%. Based on an updated analysis for overall survival, of the 361 patients randomized to YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy in CHECKMATE-9LA, the hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.80) in the 176 patients younger than 65 years compared to 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.95) in the 185 patients 65 years or older."

        "11 DESCRIPTIONIpilimumab is a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-blocking antibody. Ipilimumab is a recombinant IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin with an approximate molecular weight of 148 kDa. Ipilimumab is produced in mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cell culture.YERVOY (ipilimumab) injection, for intravenous use is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale-yellow solution, which may contain a small amount of visible translucent-to-white, amorphous ipilimumab particulates. It is supplied in single-dose vials of 50 mg/10 mL or 200 mg/40 mL. Each milliliter contains 5 mg of ipilimumab and the following inactive ingredients: diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) (0.04 mg), mannitol (10 mg), polysorbate 80 (vegetable origin) (0.1 mg), sodium chloride (5.85 mg), tris hydrochloride (3.15 mg), and Water for Injection, USP at a pH of 7."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of ActionCTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 PharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of ipilimumab was studied in 785 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 doses. The PK of ipilimumab is linear in the dose range of 0.3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. Following administration of YERVOY every 3 weeks, the systemic accumulation was 1.5-fold or less. Steady-state concentrations of ipilimumab were reached by the third dose; the mean minimum concentration (Cmin) at steady state was 19.4 mcg/mL at 3 mg/kg and 58.1 mcg/mL at 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks.EliminationThe mean (percent coefficient of variation) terminal half-life (t1/2) was 15.4 days (34%) and then mean (percent coefficient of variation) clearance (CL) was 16.8 mL/h (38%). The CL of ipilimumab was unchanged in presence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies.Specific PopulationsThe CL of ipilimumab increased with increasing body weight supporting the recommended body weight (mg/kg) based dosing. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of ipilimumab: age (range: 23 to 88 years), sex, performance status, renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin [TB] >1 to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] or AST > ULN), previous cancer therapy, and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The effect of race was not examined due to limited data available in non-White racial groups. YERVOY has not been studied in patients with moderate (TB > 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) or severe (TB >3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment.Pediatric Patients: Based on a population PK analysis using available pooled data from 565 patients from four adult studies (n=521) and two pediatric studies (n=44), body weight normalized clearance of ipilimumab is comparable between adult and pediatric patients. In pediatric patients with a dosing regimen of 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the model simulated geometric mean (CV%) steady-state serum peak and trough concentrations of ipilimumab were 65.8 (17.6%) and 20.7 (33.1%) mcg/mL (for 2 to 6 years old), 70.1 (19.6%) and 19.6 (42.9%) mcg/mL (for 6 to <12 years old), and 73.3 (20.6%) and 17.8 (50.8%) mcg/mL (for 12 years and older), which are comparable to those in adult patients.Drug Interaction StudiesIpilimumab with NivolumabWhen YERVOY 1 mg/kg was administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the CL of ipilimumab was unchanged compared to when YERVOY was administered alone.When YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks was administered in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the CL of ipilimumab increased by 30% compared to YERVOY administered alone and the CL of nivolumab was unchanged compared to nivolumab administered alone.When YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks was administered in combination with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks and chemotherapy, the CL of ipilimumab increased by 22% compared to YERVOY administered alone and the CL of nivolumab was unchanged compared to nivolumab administered alone."

        "8.4 Pediatric UseThe safety and effectiveness of YERVOY have been established in pediatric patients 12 years and older for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma or for the treatment of MSI-H or dMMR mCRC that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Use of YERVOY in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of YERVOY in adults and population pharmacokinetic data demonstrating that the exposure at doses of 3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg in the pediatric and adult populations are comparable. In addition, the tumor biology and course of advanced melanoma and MSI-H or dMMR mCRC are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older to allow extrapolation of data from adults to pediatric patients.The safety and effectiveness for pediatric patients 12 years and older have not been established for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma or for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. In addition, the safety and effectiveness have not been established with YERVOY for any indication in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age.YERVOY was evaluated in a total of 45 pediatric patients across two clinical trials. In a dose-finding trial (NCT01445379), 33 pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors were evaluated. The median age was 13 years (range 2 to 21 years) and 20 patients were ≥12 years old. YERVOY was also evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial (NCT01696045) in 12 pediatric patients ≥12 years old (range 12 to 16 years) with previously treated or untreated, unresectable Stage 3 or 4 malignant melanoma.Of the 17 patients ≥12 years of age with melanoma treated with YERVOY across both studies, 2 patients experienced objective responses including one partial response that was sustained for 16 months. There were no responses in patients with non-melanoma solid tumors. No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in these two studies."

        "8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There is insufficient human data for YERVOY exposure in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose-related manner (see Data). The effects of ipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Human IgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier and ipilimumab is an IgG1; therefore, ipilimumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Report pregnancies to Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-844-593-7869.In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.DataAnimal Data In a combined study of embryo-fetal and peri-postnatal development, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received ipilimumab every 3 weeks from the onset of organogenesis in the first trimester through parturition. No treatment-related adverse effects on reproduction were detected during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Beginning in the third trimester, administration of ipilimumab at doses resulting in exposures approximately 2.6 to 7.2 times the human exposure at a dose of 3 mg/kg resulted in dose-related increases in abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and an increased incidence of infant mortality. In addition, developmental abnormalities were identified in the urogenital system of 2 infant monkeys exposed in utero to 30 mg/kg of ipilimumab (7.2 times the humans exposure based on area under the curve at a dose of 3 mg/kg). One female infant monkey had unilateral renal agenesis of the left kidney and ureter, and 1 male infant monkey had an imperforate urethra with associated urinary obstruction and subcutaneous scrotal edema.Genetically engineered mice heterozygous for CTLA-4 (CTLA-4+/−), the target for ipilimumab, appeared healthy and gave birth to healthy CTLA-4+/− heterozygous offspring. Mated CTLA-4+/− heterozygous mice also produced offspring deficient in CTLA-4 (homozygous negative, CTLA-4−/−). The CTLA-4−/− homozygous negative offspring appeared healthy at birth, exhibited signs of multiorgan lymphoproliferative disease by 2 weeks of age, and all died by 3 to 4 weeks of age with massive lymphoproliferation and multiorgan tissue destruction."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions: Immune-mediated adverse reactions (IMAR) can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated pneumonitis, and immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction, and can occur at any time during treatment or after discontinuation. Monitor for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of IMAR. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone level and thyroid function at baseline and before each dose. In general, withhold YERVOY for severe (grade 3) and permanently discontinue for life-threatening (grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reactions. See Full Prescribing Information for additional dosage modifications. (2.5, 5.1)•Infusion-Related Reactions: Discontinue for severe and life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion-related reactions. (2.5, 5.2)•Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. (5.4, 8.1, 8.3)5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions YERVOY is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks T-cell inhibitory signals induced by the CTLA-4 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response with the potential for induction of immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not be inclusive of all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions.Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting YERVOY. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of YERVOY.Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and before each dose. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue YERVOY depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)]. In general, if YERVOY requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reaction is not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Institute hormone replacement therapy for endocrinopathies as warranted.Immune-Mediated Diarrhea or ColitisYERVOY can cause immune-mediated diarrhea/colitis, which may be fatal. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated diarrhea/colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory diarrhea/colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. If other causes are excluded, consider addition of an alternative immunosuppressive agent to the corticosteroid therapy or replacement of the corticosteroid therapy in corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis.YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a Single AgentImmune-mediated diarrhea/colitis occurred in 12% (62/511) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a single agent, including Grade 3-5 (7%) and Grade 2 (5%). Diarrhea/colitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY in 4.3% and withholding of at least one dose of YERVOY in 0.2% of patients.Systemic corticosteroids were required in 74% (46/62) of patients with immune-mediated diarrhea/colitis. Five patients required coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Diarrhea/colitis resolved in 76% of the 62 patients. One patient was withheld one or more doses of YERVOY for diarrhea/colitis, and no patient received additional treatment after symptom improvement.YERVOY 10 mg/kg as a Single AgentImmune-mediated diarrhea/colitis occurred in 31% (144/471) of patients who received YERVOY 10 mg/kg as a single agent, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (1.5%), Grade 3 (14%), and Grade 2 (14%). Diarrhea/colitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY in 61% of patients and 3.8% of patients missed at least one dose of YERVOY due to diarrhea/colitis.Systemic corticosteroids were required in 85% (123/144) of patients with immune-mediated diarrhea/colitis. Approximately 26% of the 144 patients required coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Diarrhea/colitis resolved in 90% of the 144 patients. Of the 18 patients who missed one or more doses of YERVOY for diarrhea/colitis, 17 received additional treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 14 had recurrence of diarrhea/colitis.YERVOY 1 mg/kg with Nivolumab Immune-mediated diarrhea/colitis occurred in 9% (60/666) of patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or mCRC, including Grade 3 (4.4%), and Grade 2 (3.7%). Diarrhea/colitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 3.2% and withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 2.7% of patients.In patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab, use of systemic corticosteroids was one of the diagnostic criteria required to identify immune-mediated diarrhea/colitis. Systemic corticosteroids were therefore required in 100% (60/60) of patients with immune-mediated diarrhea/colitis. Approximately 23% of patients required coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Diarrhea/colitis resolved in 95% of the 60 patients. Of the 18 patients in whom YERVOY or nivolumab was withheld for diarrhea/colitis, 16 received additional treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 10 had recurrence of diarrhea/colitis.YERVOY 3 mg/kg with Nivolumab Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 10% (5/49) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of HCC. Median time to onset was 2 months (range: 1.1 to 19 months). Immune-mediated colitis led to permanent discontinuation or withholding of treatment in 4.1% and 4.1% of patients, respectively. Sixty percent (60%) of patients with colitis received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 15 days (range: 9 days to 1.1 months). Complete resolution occurred in 80% of patients. Of the 2 patients in whom YERVOY or nivolumab was withheld for colitis, 2 received additional treatment after symptom improvement, and 2 had recurrence of colitis.Immune-Mediated HepatitisYERVOY 3 mg/kg as a Single AgentImmune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 4.1% (21/511) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a single agent, including Grade 3-5 (1.6%) and Grade 2 (2.5%). Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY in 0.4% of patients and withholding of at least one dose of YERVOY in none of the patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 29% (6/21) of patients with immune-mediated hepatitis. No patients required the coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Hepatitis resolved in 86% of the 21 patients. YERVOY 10 mg/kg as a Single AgentImmune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 15% (73/471) of patients who received YERVOY 10 mg/kg as a single agent, including Grade 4 (2.8%), Grade 3 (8%), and Grade 2 (5%). Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY in 56% of patients and 1.1% of patients missed at least one dose of YERVOY due to hepatitis. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 85% (62/73) of patients with immune-mediated hepatitis. Approximately 15% of the 73 patients required the coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Hepatitis resolved in 93% of 73 patients. Of the 5 patients who missed one or more doses of YERVOY for hepatitis, 5 received additional treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 1 had recurrence of hepatitis.YERVOY 3 mg/kg with VemurafenibThe safety and effectiveness of YERVOY in combination with vemurafenib have not been established [see Indications and Usage (1)]. In a dose-finding trial, Grade 3 increases in transaminases with or without concomitant increases in total bilirubin occurred in 6 of 10 patients who received concurrent YERVOY (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg or 720 mg twice daily).YERVOY 1 mg/kg with Nivolumab Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or mCRC, including Grade 4 (1.2%), Grade 3 (4.9%), and Grade 2 (0.4%). Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 3.6% and withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 2.6% of patients.In patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab, use of systemic corticosteroids was one of the diagnostic criteria required to identify immune-mediated hepatitis. Systemic corticosteroids were therefore required in 100% (48/48) of patients with immune-mediated hepatitis. Approximately 19% of patients required coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Hepatitis resolved in 88% of the 48 patients. Of the 17 patients in whom YERVOY or nivolumab was withheld for hepatitis, 14 received additional treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 10 had recurrence of hepatitis.YERVOY 3 mg/kg with Nivolumab Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 20% (10/49) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of HCC. Median time to onset was 1.3 months (range: 22 days to 4.1 months). Immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation or withholding of treatment in 6.1% and 12% of patients, respectively. Seventy percent (70%) of patients with hepatitis received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day) for a median duration of 14 days (range: 3 days to 34 months). Complete resolution occurred in 70% of patients. Of the 6 patients in whom YERVOY or nivolumab was withheld for hepatitis, 4 received additional treatment after symptom improvement, and 3 had recurrence of hepatitis.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsYERVOY can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis, including bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-bullous/exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue YERVOY depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)].YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a Single AgentImmune-mediated rash occurred in 15% (76/511) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a single agent, including Grade 3-5 (2.5%) and Grade 2 (12%).

Severe to life-threatening (Grade 3-4) endocrinopathies occurred in 9 patients (1.8%). All 9 of these patients had hypopituitarism with some patients having additional concomitant endocrinopathies, such as adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. Six of the 9 patients were hospitalized for severe endocrinopathies. Moderate (Grade 2) endocrinopathy occurred in 12 patients (2.3%), including hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, hyperthyroidism and Cushing’s syndrome. Of the 21 patients with moderate to life-threatening endocrinopathy, 17 required long-term hormone replacement therapy, including adrenal hormones (n=10) and thyroid hormones (n=13).YERVOY 10 mg/kg as a Single AgentImmune-mediated endocrinopathies occurred in 28% of patients (132/471), including Grade 4 (0.6%), Grade 3 (8%) and Grade 2 (20%).

Of the 93 patients, 20% were reported to have resolution.One hundred twenty-four patients received systemic corticosteroids as immunosuppression and/or adrenal hormone replacement for Grade 2 to 4 endocrinopathy. Of these, 42 (34%) were able to discontinue corticosteroids. Seventy-three patients received thyroid hormones for treatment of Grade 2 to 4 hypothyroidism. Of these, 14 patients (19%) were able to discontinue thyroid replacement therapy.YERVOY 1 mg/kg with Nivolumab Hypophysitis: YERVOY can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field cuts. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue YERVOY depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)].Hypophysitis occurred in 4.4% (29/666) of patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or mCRC, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (2.4%), and Grade 2 (0.9%).

In patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab, use of systemic corticosteroids was one of the diagnostic criteria required to identify immune-mediated pneumonitis. Systemic corticosteroids were therefore required in 100% (26/26) of patients with immune-mediated pneumonitis. Approximately 8% required coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Pneumonitis resolved in 92% of the 26 patients. Of the 10 patients in whom YERVOY or nivolumab was withheld for pneumonitis, 10 received additional treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 4 had recurrence of pneumonitis.In NSCLC, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients receiving YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4.0%) immune-mediated pneumonitis. Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis. The median duration was 1.5 months (range: 5 days to 25+ months). Immune-mediated pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY with nivolumab in 5% of patients and withholding of YERVOY with nivolumab in 3.6% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% of patients with pneumonitis followed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis resolved in 72% of the patients. Approximately 13% (2/16) of patients had recurrence of pneumonitis after re-initiation of YERVOY with nivolumab.The incidence and severity of immune-mediated pneumonitis in patients with NSCLC treated with YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in combination with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy were comparable to treatment with YERVOY in combination with nivolumab only.YERVOY 3 mg/kg with Nivolumab Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 10% (5/49) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of HCC.

In patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab, use of systemic corticosteroids was one of the diagnostic criteria required to identify immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction. Systemic corticosteroids were therefore required in 100% (27/27) of patients with immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction. Nephritis with renal dysfunction resolved in 67% of the 27 patients. Of the 12 patients in whom YERVOY or nivolumab was withheld for nephritis, 10 received additional treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 4 had recurrence of nephritis.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsAcross clinical trials of YERVOY administered as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1% of patients unless otherwise specified, as shown below: Nervous System: Autoimmune neuropathy (2%), meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, motor dysfunctionCardiovascular: Angiopathy, myocarditis, pericarditis, temporal arteritis, vasculitisOcular: Blepharitis, episcleritis, iritis, orbital myositis, scleritis, uveitis. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving YERVOY and may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.Gastrointestinal: Duodenitis, gastritis, pancreatitis (1.3%)Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Arthritis, myositis, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis, rhabdomyolysisOther (hematologic/immune): Aplastic anemia, conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), hypersensitivity vasculitis, meningitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome5.2 Infusion-Related ReactionsSevere infusion-related reactions can occur with YERVOY. Discontinue YERVOY in patients with severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)]. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.9% (28/982) of patients who received single-agent YERVOY 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for the treatment of melanoma. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 5% (33/666) of patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or CRC. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of HCC.5.3 Complications of Allogenic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant after YERVOYFatal or serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can occur in patients who receive YERVOY either before or after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between CTLA-4 receptor blocking antibody and allogeneic HSCT.Follow patients closely for evidence of GVHD and intervene promptly [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with YERVOY after allogeneic HSCT.5.4 Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight) and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose-related manner. The effects of ipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].5.5 Risks Associated When Administered in Combination with NivolumabYERVOY is indicated for use in combination with nivolumab for patients with advanced RCC, MSI-H or dMMR mCRC, HCC, and NSCLC. Refer to the nivolumab Full Prescribing Information for additional risk information that applies to the combination use treatment."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONSThe following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:•Severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].•Infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) with YERVOY as a single agent are fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, rash, and colitis. Additional common adverse reactions at the 10 mg/kg dose (≥5%) include nausea, vomiting, headache, weight loss, pyrexia, decreased appetite, and insomnia. (6.1)Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with YERVOY in combination with nivolumab are fatigue, rash, pruritus, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, cough, pyrexia, decreased appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, arthralgia, headache, vomiting, dyspnea, dizziness, hypothyroidism, and decreased weight. (6.1)Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) with YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy are fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, diarrhea, rash, decreased appetite, constipation, and pruritus. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.6.1 Clinical Trials ExperienceBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.The data described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a single agent (or in combination with an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine) in 511 patients in Study MDX010-20; YERVOY 10 mg/kg as a single agent in 471 patients in Study CA184-029; YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in 1,062 patients in CHECKMATE-214, CHECKMATE-142, and CHECKMATE-227; YERVOY 3 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 1 mg/kg in 49 patients in CHECKMATE-040; and to YERVOY 1 mg/kg, administered in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy in CHECKMATE-9LA, an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial in adult patients with previously untreated metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.Unresectable or Metastatic MelanomaThe safety of YERVOY was evaluated in 643 previously treated patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma in Study MDX010-20 [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Study MDX010-20 excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation. Patients received YERVOY 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion for 4 doses as a single agent (n=131), YERVOY with an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine (n=380), or gp100 peptide vaccine as a single agent (n=132). Patients in the trial received a median of 4 doses (range: 1 to 4 doses).The trial population characteristics were: median age 57 years (range: 19 to 90), 59% male, 94% White, and baseline ECOG performance status 0 (56%).YERVOY was discontinued for adverse reactions in 10% of patients. Table 2 presents adverse reactions from Study MDX010-20.Table 2: Selected Adverse Reactions (≥ 5%) in Patients Receiving YERVOY with a Difference Between Arms of >5% for All Grades and >1% for Grades 3 to 5 Compared to gp100 Peptide Vaccine in Study MDX010-20Adverse ReactionsYERVOY 3 mg/kgn=131YERVOY 3 mg/kg and gp100n=380gp100n=132All Grades (%)Grade 3 to 5 (%)All Grades(%)Grade 3 to 5 (%)All Grades (%)Grade 3 to 5 (%)General and Administration-Site Conditions Fatigue417345313Gastrointestinal Diarrhea325374201 Colitis855320Dermatologic Pruritus31021<1110 Rash29225280Adjuvant Treatment of MelanomaThe safety of YERVOY was evaluated in 945 patients with resected Stage IIIA (>1 mm nodal involvement), IIIB, and IIIC (with no in-transit metastases) cutaneous melanoma in Study CA184-029 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Study CA184-029 excluded patients with prior systemic therapy for melanoma, autoimmune disease, a condition requiring systemic immunosuppression, or a positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV. Patients received YERVOY 10 mg/kg (n=471) or placebo (n=474) administered as an intravenous infusion for 4 doses every 3 weeks followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks beginning at Week 24 up to a maximum of 3 years. In this trial, 36% of patients received YERVOY for longer than 6 months and 26% of patients received YERVOY for longer than 1 year. YERVOY-treated patients in the trial received a median of 4 doses (range: 1 to 16).The trial population characteristics were: median age 51 years (range: 18 to 84 years), 62% male, 99% White, and baseline ECOG performance status 0 (94%).YERVOY was discontinued for adverse reactions in 52% of patients.

Patients received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=547) or sunitinib 50 mg orally daily for first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle (n=535). The median duration of treatment was 7.9 months (range: 1 day to 21.4+ months) in YERVOY and nivolumab arm. In this trial, 57% of patients in the YERVOY and nivolumab arm were exposed to treatment for greater than 6 months and 38% of patients were exposed to treatment for greater than 1 year.Serious adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients receiving YERVOY with nivolumab. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in >2% of patients treated with YERVOY and nivolumab were diarrhea, pyrexia, pneumonia, pneumonitis, hypophysitis, acute kidney injury, dyspnea, adrenal insufficiency, and colitis. In patients who received YERVOY with nivolumab, study therapy was discontinued for adverse reactions in 31% and delayed for adverse reactions in 54%.The most common adverse reactions (>20%) in the YERVOY and nivolumab arm were fatigue, rash, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, nausea, cough, pyrexia, arthralgia, vomiting, dyspnea, and decreased appetite.

All patients had received prior fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for metastatic disease; 69% had received prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan and 29% had received an anti-EGFR antibody. Patients received YERVOY 1 mg/kg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 doses, then nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure for YERVOY was 2.1 months.Serious adverse reactions occurred in 47% of patients receiving YERVOY and nivolumab. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in >2% of patients were colitis/diarrhea, hepatic events, abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, pyrexia, and dehydration. The most common adverse reactions (>20%) in the YERVOY and nivolumab cohort were fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, pruritus, nausea, rash, decreased appetite, and vomiting.

YERVOY and nivolumab were administered every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by single-agent nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.During the YERVOY and nivolumab combination period, 33 of 49 (67%) patients received all four planned doses of YERVOY and nivolumab. During the entire treatment period, the median duration of exposure to YERVOY was 2.1 months (range: 0 to 4.5 months) and to nivolumab was 5.1 months (range: 0 to 35+ months). Forty-seven percent of patients were exposed to treatment for >6 months, and 35% of patients were exposed to treatment for >1 year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients. Treatment was discontinued in 29% of patients and delayed in 65% of patients for an adverse reaction.Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥4% of patients were pyrexia, diarrhea, anemia, increased AST, adrenal insufficiency, ascites, esophageal varices hemorrhage, hyponatremia, increased blood bilirubin, and pneumonitis.Table 9 summarizes the adverse reactions and Table 10 summarizes the laboratory abnormalities of YERVOY in combination with nivolumab in CHECKMATE-040.Table 9: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥10% of Patients Receiving YERVOY in Combination with Nivolumab in Cohort 4 of CHECKMATE-040Adverse ReactionYERVOY and Nivolumab(n=49)All Grades (%)Grades 3-4 (%)Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Rash538 Pruritus534Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Musculoskeletal pain412 Arthralgia100Gastrointestinal Diarrhea394 Abdominal pain226 Nausea200 Ascites146 Constipation140 Dry mouth120 Dyspepsia122 Vomiting122 Stomatitis100Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Cough370 Dyspnea140 Pneumonitis102Metabolism and Nutrition Decreased appetite352General Fatigue272 Pyrexia270 Malaise182 Edema162 Influenza-like illness140 Chills100Nervous System Headache220 Dizziness200Endocrine Hypothyroidism200 Adrenal insufficiency184Investigations Weight decreased200Psychiatric Insomnia180Blood and Lymphatic System Anemia104Infections Influenza102Vascular Hypotension100Clinically important adverse reactions reported in <10% of patients receiving YERVOY with nivolumab were hyperglycemia (8%), colitis (4%), and increased blood creatine phosphokinase (2%).Table 10: Select Laboratory Abnormalities (≥10%) Worsening from Baseline in Patients Receiving YERVOY in Combination with Nivolumab in Cohort 4 of CHECKMATE-040Laboratory AbnormalityYERVOY and Nivolumab(n=47)All Grades (%)Grades 3-4 (%)Hematology Lymphopenia5313 Anemia434.3 Neutropenia439 Leukopenia402.1 Thrombocytopenia344.3Chemistry Increased AST6640 Increased ALT6621 Increased bilirubin5511 Increased lipase5126 Hyponatremia4932 Hypocalcemia470 Increased alkaline phosphatase404.3 Increased amylase3815 Hypokalemia262.1 Hyperkalemia234.3 Increased creatinine210 Hypomagnesemia110In patients who received YERVOY with nivolumab, virologic breakthrough occurred in 4 of 28 (14%) patients and 2 of 4 (50%) patients with active HBV or HCV at baseline, respectively. HBV virologic breakthrough was defined as at least a 1 log increase in HBV DNA for those patients with detectable HBV DNA at baseline. HCV virologic breakthrough was defined as a 1 log increase in HCV RNA from baseline.First-line Treatment of Metastatic NSCLC: In Combination with Nivolumab The safety of YERVOY in combination with nivolumab was evaluated in CHECKMATE-227, a randomized, multicenter, multi-cohort, open-label trial in patients with previously untreated metastatic or recurrent NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. The trial excluded patients with untreated brain metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients received YERVOY 1 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 6 weeks and nivolumab 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks or platinum-doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. The median duration of therapy in YERVOY and nivolumab-treated patients was 4.2 months (range: 1 day to 25.5 months): 39% of patients received YERVOY and nivolumab for >6 months and 23% of patients received YERVOY and nivolumab for >1 year. The population characteristics were: median age 64 years (range: 26 to 87); 48% were ≥65 years of age, 76% White, and 67% male. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (35%) or 1 (65%), 85% were former/current smokers, 11% had brain metastases, 28% had squamous histology and 72% had non-squamous histology.Serious adverse reactions occurred in 58% of patients. YERVOY and nivolumab were discontinued for adverse reactions in 24% of patients and 53% had at least one dose withheld for an adverse reaction.The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, diarrhea/colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypophysitis. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.7% of patients; these included events of pneumonitis (4 patients), myocarditis, acute kidney injury, shock, hyperglycemia, multi-system organ failure, and renal failure. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, rash, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea/colitis, dyspnea, cough, hepatitis, nausea, and pruritus.Tables 11 and 12 summarize selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in CHECKMATE-227.Table 11: Adverse Reactions in ≥10% of Patients Receiving YERVOY and Nivolumab - CHECKMATE-227a Includes fatigue and asthenia. b Includes eyelid edema, face edema, generalized edema, localized edema, edema, edema peripheral, and periorbital edema. c Includes autoimmune dermatitis, dermatitis, dermatitis acneiform, dermatitis allergic, dermatitis atopic, dermatitis bullous, dermatitis contact, dermatitis exfoliative, dermatitis psoriasiform, granulomatous dermatitis, rash generalized, drug eruption, dyshidrotic eczema, eczema, exfoliative rash, nodular rash, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash papular, rash pruritic, rash pustular, toxic skin eruption. d Includes pruritus and pruritus generalized. e Includes back pain, bone pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, musculoskeletal discomfort, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, and pain in extremity. f Includes colitis, colitis microscopic, colitis ulcerative, diarrhea, enteritis infectious, enterocolitis, enterocolitis infectious, and enterocolitis viral. g Includes abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, abdominal pain lower, abdominal pain upper, and abdominal tenderness. h Includes dyspnea and dyspnea exertional. i Includes cough and productive cough. j Includes alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, autoimmune hepatitis, blood bilirubin increased, hepatic enzyme increased, hepatic failure, hepatic function abnormal, hepatitis, hepatitis E, hepatocellular injury, hepatotoxicity, hyperbilirubinemia, immune-mediated hepatitis, liver function test abnormal, liver function test increased, transaminases increased. k Includes autoimmune thyroiditis, blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, hypothyroidism, primary hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, and tri-iodothyronine free decreased. l Contains blood thyroid stimulating hormone decreased, hyperthyroidism, and tri-iodothyronine free increased. m Includes lower respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection bacterial, lung infection, pneumonia, pneumonia adenoviral, pneumonia aspiration, pneumonia bacterial, pneumonia klebsiella, pneumonia influenzal, pneumonia viral, atypical pneumonia, organizing pneumonia.Adverse ReactionYERVOY and Nivolumab (n=576)Platinum-doublet Chemotherapy (n=570)All Grades (%)Grades 3-4 (%)All Grades (%)Grades 3-4 (%)General Fatiguea446424.4 Pyrexia180.5110.4 Edemab140.2120.5Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Rashc344.7100.4 Pruritusd210.53.30Metabolism and Nutrition Decreased appetite312.3261.4Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Musculoskeletal paine271.9160.7 Arthralgia130.92.50.2Gastrointestinal Diarrhea/colitisf263.6160.9 Nausea211.0422.5 Constipation180.3270.5 Vomiting131.0182.3 Abdominal paing100.290.7Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Dyspneah264.3162.1 Coughi230.2130Hepatobiliary Hepatitisj219101.2Endocrine Hypothyroidismk160.51.20 Hyperthyroidisml1000.50Infections and Infestations Pneumoniam13784.0Nervous System Headache110.560Other clinically important adverse reactions in CHECKMATE-227 were:Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue: urticaria, alopecia, erythema multiforme, vitiligoGastrointestinal: stomatitis, pancreatitis, gastritisMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, rhabdomyolysisNervous System: peripheral neuropathy, autoimmune encephalitisBlood and Lymphatic System: eosinophiliaEye Disorders: blurred vision, uveitisCardiac: atrial fibrillation, myocarditisTable 12: Laboratory Values Worsening from Baselinea Occurring in ≥20% of Patients on YERVOY and Nivolumab - CHECKMATE-227a Each test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at least one on-study laboratory measurement available: YERVOY and nivolumab group (range: 494 to 556 patients) and chemotherapy group (range: 469 to 542 patients).Laboratory AbnormalityYERVOY and NivolumabPlatinum-doublet ChemotherapyGrades 1-4 (%)Grades 3-4 (%)Grades 1-4 (%)Grades 3-4 (%)Hematology Anemia463.67814 Lymphopenia4656015Chemistry Hyponatremia4112264.9 Increased AST395260.4 Increased ALT367270.7 Increased lipase3514143.4 Increased alkaline phosphatase343.8200.2 Increased amylase289181.9 Hypocalcemia281.7171.3 Hyperkalemia273.4220.4 Increased creatinine220.9170.2First-line Treatment of Metastatic or Recurrent NSCLC: In Combination with Nivolumab and Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy The safety of YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy was evaluated in CHECKMATE-9LA [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. Patients received either YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered every 6 weeks in combination with nivolumab 360 mg administered every 3 weeks and platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 2 cycles; or platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. The median duration of therapy in YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy was 6 months (range: 1 day to 19 months): 50% of patients received YERVOY and nivolumab for >6 months and 13% of patients received YERVOY and nivolumab for >1 year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 57% of patients who were treated with YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The most frequent (>2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, anemia, acute kidney injury, musculoskeletal pain, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 7 (2%) patients, and included hepatic toxicity, acute renal failure, sepsis, pneumonitis, diarrhea with hypokalemia, and massive hemoptysis in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Study therapy with YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy was permanently discontinued for adverse reactions in 24% of patients and 56% had at least one treatment withheld for an adverse reaction. The most common (>20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, diarrhea, rash, decreased appetite, constipation, and pruritus.Tables 13 and 14 summarize selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in CHECKMATE-9LA.Table 13: Adverse Reactions in >10% of Patients Receiving YERVOY and Nivolumab and Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy - CHECKMATE-9LAToxicity was graded per NCI CTCAE v4. a Includes fatigue and asthenia b Includes myalgia, back pain, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, flank pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal chest pain, musculoskeletal disorder, osteitis, musculoskeletal stiffness, non-cardiac chest pain, arthralgia, arthritis, arthropathy, joint effusion, psoriatic arthropathy, synovitis c Includes colitis, ulcerative colitis, diarrhea, and enterocolitis d Includes abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, lower abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal pain e Includes acne, dermatitis, acneiform dermatitis, allergic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, bullous dermatitis, generalized exfoliative dermatitis, eczema, keratoderma blenorrhagica, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, rash, erythematous rash, generalized rash, macular rash, maculo-papular rash, morbilliform rash, papular rash, pruritic rash, skin exfoliation, skin reaction, skin toxicity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria f Includes pruritus and generalized pruritus g Includes cough, productive cough, and upper-airway cough syndrome h Includes dyspnea, dyspnea at rest, and exertional dyspnea i Includes autoimmune thyroiditis, increased blood thyroid stimulating hormone, hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, and decreased free tri-iodothyronine j Includes dizziness, vertigo and positional vertigoAdverse ReactionYERVOY and Nivolumab and Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy (n=358)Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy (n=349)All Grades (%)Grades 3-4 (%)All Grades (%)Grades 3-4 (%)General Fatiguea495404.9 Pyrexia140.6100.6Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Musculoskeletal painb394.5272.0Gastrointestinal Nausea321.7410.9 Diarrheac316181.7 Constipation210.6230.6 Vomiting182.0171.4 Abdominal paind120.6110.9Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Rashe304.7100.3 Pruritusf210.82.90 Alopecia110.8100.6Metabolism and Nutrition Decreased appetite282.0221.7Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Coughg190.6150.9 Dyspneah184.7143.2Endocrine Hypothyroidismi190.33.40Nervous System Headache110.670 Dizzinessj110.660Table 14: Laboratory Values Worsening from Baselinea Occurring in >20% of Patients on YERVOY and Nivolumab and Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy - CHECKMATE-9LAa Each test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at least one on-study laboratory measurement available: YERVOY and nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy group (range: 197 to 347 patients) and platinum-doublet chemotherapy group (range: 191 to 335 patients).Laboratory AbnormalityYERVOY and Nivolumab and Platinum-Doublet ChemotherapyPlatinum-Doublet ChemotherapyGrades 1-4 (%)Grades 3-4 (%)Grades 1-4 (%)Grades 3-4 (%)Hematology Anemia7097416 Lymphopenia4164011 Neutropenia40154215 Leukopenia3610409 Thrombocytopenia234.3245Chemistry Hyperglycemia457422.6 Hyponatremia3710277 Increased ALT344.3241.2 Increased lipase3112102.2 Increased alkaline phosphatase311.2260.3 Increased amylase307191.3 Increased AST303.5220.3 Hypomagnesemia291.2330.6 Hypocalcemia261.4221.8 Increased creatinine261.2230.6 Hyperkalemia221.7212.16.2 ImmunogenicityAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidences of antibodies to other studies or to other products may be misleading.Eleven (1.1%) of 1024 evaluable patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma tested positive for treatment-emergent binding antibodies against ipilimumab in an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. This assay had substantial limitations in detecting anti-ipilimumab antibodies in the presence of ipilimumab. Seven (4.9%) of 144 patients receiving ipilimumab developed anti-ipilimumab antibodies and 7 (4.5%) of 156 patients receiving placebo for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma tested positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies using an ECL assay with improved drug tolerance. No patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. No infusion-related reactions occurred in patients who tested positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies.Of the 499 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-214 and CHECKMATE-142, 27 (5.4%) were positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies; there were no patients with neutralizing antibodies against ipilimumab. There was no evidence of increased incidence of infusion reactions to YERVOY in patients with anti-ipilimumab antibodies.Of 483 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-227 Part 1, 8.5% were positive for treatment-emergent anti-ipilimumab antibodies. No patients had neutralizing antibodies against ipilimumab. In Part 1 of the same study, of 491 patients evaluable for anti-nivolumab antibodies, 36.7% were positive for anti-nivolumab antibodies and 1.4% had neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab.Of 305 patients evaluable for anti-ipilimumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-9LA, 8% were positive for anti-ipilimumab antibodies and 1.6% were positive for anti-ipilimumab neutralizing antibodies. There was no evidence of increased incidence of infusion reactions to YERVOY in patients with anti-ipilimumab antibodies. Of 308 patients evaluable for anti-nivolumab antibodies in CHECKMATE-9LA, 34% were positive for anti-nivolumab antibodies and 2.6% had neutralizing antibodies against nivolumab.6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of YERVOY. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.Immune System: graft-versus-host diseaseSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome)"

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS•Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2)8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There is insufficient human data for YERVOY exposure in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose-related manner (see Data). The effects of ipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Human IgG1 is known to cross the placental barrier and ipilimumab is an IgG1; therefore, ipilimumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Report pregnancies to Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-844-593-7869.In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.DataAnimal Data In a combined study of embryo-fetal and peri-postnatal development, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received ipilimumab every 3 weeks from the onset of organogenesis in the first trimester through parturition. No treatment-related adverse effects on reproduction were detected during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Beginning in the third trimester, administration of ipilimumab at doses resulting in exposures approximately 2.6 to 7.2 times the human exposure at a dose of 3 mg/kg resulted in dose-related increases in abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight), and an increased incidence of infant mortality. In addition, developmental abnormalities were identified in the urogenital system of 2 infant monkeys exposed in utero to 30 mg/kg of ipilimumab (7.2 times the humans exposure based on area under the curve at a dose of 3 mg/kg). One female infant monkey had unilateral renal agenesis of the left kidney and ureter, and 1 male infant monkey had an imperforate urethra with associated urinary obstruction and subcutaneous scrotal edema.Genetically engineered mice heterozygous for CTLA-4 (CTLA-4+/−), the target for ipilimumab, appeared healthy and gave birth to healthy CTLA-4+/− heterozygous offspring. Mated CTLA-4+/− heterozygous mice also produced offspring deficient in CTLA-4 (homozygous negative, CTLA-4−/−). The CTLA-4−/− homozygous negative offspring appeared healthy at birth, exhibited signs of multiorgan lymphoproliferative disease by 2 weeks of age, and all died by 3 to 4 weeks of age with massive lymphoproliferation and multiorgan tissue destruction.8.2 Lactation Risk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of YERVOY in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or milk production. In monkeys, ipilimumab was present in milk (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the last dose.DataIn monkeys treated at dose levels resulting in exposures 2.6 and 7.2 times higher than those in humans at a 3 mg/kg dose, ipilimumab was present in milk at concentrations of 0.1 mcg/mL and 0.4 mcg/mL, representing a ratio of up to 0.3% of the steady-state serum concentration of the drug.8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy TestingVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating YERVOY [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].ContraceptionYERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months following the last dose.8.4 Pediatric UseThe safety and effectiveness of YERVOY have been established in pediatric patients 12 years and older for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma or for the treatment of MSI-H or dMMR mCRC that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Use of YERVOY in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of YERVOY in adults and population pharmacokinetic data demonstrating that the exposure at doses of 3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg in the pediatric and adult populations are comparable. In addition, the tumor biology and course of advanced melanoma and MSI-H or dMMR mCRC are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older to allow extrapolation of data from adults to pediatric patients.The safety and effectiveness for pediatric patients 12 years and older have not been established for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma or for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. In addition, the safety and effectiveness have not been established with YERVOY for any indication in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age.YERVOY was evaluated in a total of 45 pediatric patients across two clinical trials. In a dose-finding trial (NCT01445379), 33 pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors were evaluated. The median age was 13 years (range 2 to 21 years) and 20 patients were ≥12 years old. YERVOY was also evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial (NCT01696045) in 12 pediatric patients ≥12 years old (range 12 to 16 years) with previously treated or untreated, unresectable Stage 3 or 4 malignant melanoma.Of the 17 patients ≥12 years of age with melanoma treated with YERVOY across both studies, 2 patients experienced objective responses including one partial response that was sustained for 16 months. There were no responses in patients with non-melanoma solid tumors. No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in these two studies.8.5 Geriatric UseOf the 511 patients treated with YERVOY in Study MDX010-20 (unresectable or metastatic melanoma), 28% were 65 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients.Study CA184-029 (adjuvant treatment of melanoma) and CHECKMATE-142 (metastatic colorectal cancer) did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.Of the 550 patients randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab in CHECKMATE-214 (renal cell carcinoma), 38% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was observed between these patients and younger patients. In geriatric patients with intermediate or poor risk, no overall difference in effectiveness was observed.Of the 49 patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab in Cohort 4 of CHECKMATE-040 (hepatocellular carcinoma), 29% were between 65 years and 74 years of age and 8% were 75 years or older. Clinical studies of YERVOY in combination with nivolumab did not include sufficient numbers of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.Of the 576 patients randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in CHECKMATE-227 (NSCLC), 48% were 65 years or older and 10% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between older patients and younger patients; however, there was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older (29%) relative to all patients who received YERVOY with nivolumab (18%). Of the 396 patients in the primary efficacy population (PD-L1 ≥1%) randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with in CHECKMATE-227, the hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.89) in the 199 patients younger than 65 years compared to 0.91 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.15) in the 197 patients 65 years or older [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].Of the 361 patients randomized to YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in combination with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks and platinum-doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks (for 2 cycles) in CHECKMATE-9LA (NSCLC), 51% were 65 years or older and 10% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety was reported between older patients and younger patients; however, there was a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions in patients aged 75 years or older (43%) relative to all patients who received YERVOY with nivolumab and chemotherapy (24%). For patients aged 75 years or older who received chemotherapy only, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 16% relative to all patients who had a discontinuation rate of 13%. Based on an updated analysis for overall survival, of the 361 patients randomized to YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy in CHECKMATE-9LA, the hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.80) in the 176 patients younger than 65 years compared to 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.95) in the 185 patients 65 years or older."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES14.1 Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The efficacy of YERVOY were investigated in a Study MDX010-20, a randomized (3:1:1), double-blind, double-dummy trial (NCT00094653) that included patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma previously treated with one or more of the following: aldesleukin, dacarbazine, temozolomide, fotemustine, or carboplatin. The trial enrolled only patients with HLA-A2*0201 genotype; this HLA genotype facilitates the immune presentation of the investigational peptide vaccine. The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation. Patients were randomized to YERVOY administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses with an investigational peptide vaccine with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant - gp100 administered at a dose of 2 mg peptide by deep subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks for 4 doses; gp100 administered at a dose of 2 mg by deep subcutaneous injection every 3 weeks for 4 doses as a single agent with a placebo; or YERVOY administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses with a placebo. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) in the YERVOY and gp100 arm compared to that in the single-agent gp100 arm. Secondary efficacy outcome measures were OS in the YERVOY and gp100 arm compared to the YERVOY arm, OS in the YERVOY arm compared to the gp100 arm, best overall response rate (BORR) as assessed by the investigator at week 24 between each of the trial arms, and duration of response. Assessment of tumor response was conducted at weeks 12 and 24, and every 3 months thereafter. Patients with evidence of objective tumor response at 12 or 24 weeks had assessment for confirmation of durability of response at 16 or 28 weeks, respectively.A total of 676 patients were randomized, 403 to YERVOY and gp100 arm, 137 to YERVOY single agent arm and 136 to gp100 single agent arm. Of the randomized patients, 61%, 59%, and 54% in the YERVOY and gp100, YERVOY, and gp100 arms, respectively, were male. Twenty-nine percent were ≥65 years of age, the median age was 57 years, 71% had M1c stage, 12% had a history of previously treated brain metastasis, 98% had ECOG performance status of 0 and 1, 23% had received aldesleukin, and 38% had elevated LDH level. Sixty-one percent of patients randomized to either YERVOY-containing arm received all 4 planned doses. The median duration of follow-up was 8.9 months.The efficacy results are shown in Table 15 and Figure 1.Table 15: Efficacy Results for Study MDX010-20a Not adjusted for multiple comparisons. b Not reachedYERVOY 3 mg/kg n=137YERVOY 3 mg/kg and gp100 n=403gp100 n=136Overall SurvivalMedian in months (95% CI)10 (8.0, 13.8)10 (8.5, 11.5)6 (5.5, 8.7)Hazard ratio (vs. gp100) (95% CI)0.66 (0.51, 0.87)0.68 (0.55, 0.85)p-valuep=0.0026ap=0.0004Hazard ratio (vs. YERVOY) (95% CI)1.04 (0.83, 1.30)Best Overall Response Rate (BORR)(95% CI)10.9%(6.3%, 17.4%)5.7%(3.7%, 8.4%)1.5%(0.2%, 5.2%)Median duration of response in monthsNRb11.5NRbFigure 1: Kaplan Meier Curves for Overall Survival in Study MDX010-20Figure 114.2 Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma The efficacy of YERVOY for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma was evaluated in Study CA184-029 (NCT00636168), a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with resected Stage IIIA (>1 mm nodal involvement), IIIB, and IIIC (with no in-transit metastases) histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma. Enrollment required complete resection of melanoma with full lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to randomization. Patients with prior therapy for melanoma, autoimmune disease, and prior or concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents were ineligible. Patients were randomized to receive YERVOY 10 mg/kg or placebo as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by YERVOY 10 mg/kg or placebo every 12 weeks from Week 24 to Week 156 (3 years) or until documented disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by stage according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2002 classification (Stage IIIA >1 mm nodal involvement, Stage IIIB, Stage IIIC with 1 to 3 involved lymph nodes, and Stage IIIC with ≥4 involved lymph nodes) and by region (North America, Europe, and Australia). The major efficacy outcome measures were independent review committee (IRC)-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS), defined as the time between the date of randomization and the earliest date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis) or death, and overall survival. Tumor assessment was conducted every 12 weeks for the first 3 years then every 24 weeks until distant recurrence.Among 951 patients enrolled, 475 were randomized to receive YERVOY and 476 to placebo. Median age was 51 years (range: 18 to 84), 62% were male, 99% were White, 94% had ECOG performance status of 0. With regard to disease stage, 20% had Stage IIIA with lymph nodes >1 mm, 44% had Stage IIIB, and 36% had Stage IIIC (with no in-transit metastases). Other disease characteristics of the trial population were: clinically palpable lymph nodes (58%), 2 or more positive lymph nodes (54%), and ulcerated primary lesions (42%).The efficacy results are in Table 16 and Figure 2.Table 16: Efficacy Results for Study CA184-029a Stratified by disease stage.YERVOY 10 mg/kg n=475Placebo n=476Recurrence-Free SurvivalNumber of events234 (49%)294 (62%) Recurrence220289 Death145Median in months (95% CI)26 (19, 39)17 (13, 22)Hazard ratio (95% CI)0.75 (0.64, 0.90)p-value (stratified log-ranka)p<0.002Overall SurvivalNumber of deaths162 (34%)214 (45%)Hazard ratio (95% CI)0.72 (0.58, 0.88)p-value (stratified log-ranka)p<0.002Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival in Study CA184-029Figure 214.3 Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma The efficacy of YERVOY with nivolumab was evaluated in CHECKMATE-214 (NCT02231749), a randomized (1:1), open-label study in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC. Patients were included regardless of their PD-L1 status. CHECKMATE-214 excluded patients with any history of or concurrent brain metastases, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients were randomized to nivolumab 3 mg/kg and YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every two weeks or to sunitinib administered orally 50 mg daily for the first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) prognostic score and region. The major efficacy outcome measures were OS, PFS (IRRC-assessed), and confirmed ORR (IRRC-assessed) in intermediate/poor risk patients. Intermediate/poor risk patients had at least 1 or more of 6 prognostic risk factors as per the IMDC criteria: less than one year from time of initial RCC diagnosis to randomization, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <80%, hemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, corrected calcium >10 mg/dL, platelet count > ULN, and absolute neutrophil count > ULN.A total of 847 patients were randomized, 425 to YERVOY with nivolumab and 422 to sunitinib. The median age was 61 years (range: 21 to 85) with 38% ≥65 years of age and 8% ≥75 years of age. The majority of patients were male (73%) and White (87%) and 26% and 74% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70% to 80% and 90% to 100%, respectively.Efficacy results from CHECKMATE-214 are presented in Table 17 and Figure 3. In intermediate/poor risk patients, the trial demonstrated statistically significant improvement in OS and ORR for patients randomized to YERVOY and nivolumab arm as compared with sunitinib arm. OS benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level. The trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS.Table 17: Efficacy Results for CHECKMATE-214a Based on a stratified proportional hazards model. b Based on a stratified log-rank test. c p-value is compared to alpha 0.002 in order to achieve statistical significance. d Based on the stratified DerSimonian-Laird test. e p-value is compared to alpha 0.001 in order to achieve statistical significance. f Not Significant at alpha level of 0.009Efficacy ParameterIntermediate/Poor-RiskYERVOY 1 mg/kg with Nivolumab n=425Sunitinib n=422Overall Survival Number of deaths140 (32.9%)188 (44.5%) Median in monthsNE25.9 Hazard ratio (99.8% CI)a0.63 (0.44, 0.89) p-valueb,c<0.0001Confirmed Objective Response Rate (95% CI)41.6% (36.9%, 46.5%)26.5% (22.4%, 31.0%) Complete Response40 (9.4%)5 (1.2%) Partial Response137 (32.2%)107 (25.4%) Median duration of response in months (95% CI)NE (21.8, NE)18.2 (14.8, NE)p-valued,e<0.0001Progression-free Survival Number of events (progression or death)228 (53.6%)228 (54.0%) Median in months11.68.4 Hazard ratio (99.1% CI)a0.82 (0.64, 1.05) p-valuebNSfFigure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curves for Overall Survival (Intermediate/Poor Risk Population) in CHECKMATE-214CHECKMATE-214 also randomized 249 favorable risk patients as per IMDC criteria to nivolumab and YERVOY (n=125) or to sunitinib (n=124). These patients were not evaluated as part of the efficacy analysis population. OS in favorable risk patients receiving nivolumab and YERVOY compared to sunitinib has a hazard ratio of 1.45 (95% CI: 0.75, 2.81). The efficacy of nivolumab and YERVOY in previously untreated renal cell carcinoma with favorable risk disease has not been established.Figure 314.4 Microsatellite Instability-High or Mismatch Repair Deficient Metastatic Colorectal Cancer The efficacy of YERVOY with nivolumab was evaluated in CHECKMATE-142 (NCT02060188), a multicenter, non-randomized, multiple parallel-cohort, open-label study conducted in patients with locally determined dMMR or MSI-H mCRC who had disease progression during or after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, or irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Key eligibility criteria were at least one prior line of treatment for metastatic disease, ECOG PS 0 or 1, and absence of the following: active brain metastases, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients enrolled in the YERVOY and nivolumab MSI-H or dMMR mCRC cohort received YERVOY 1 mg/kg and nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously as a single agent every 2 weeks. Efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by independent radiographic review committee (IRRC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) and duration of response (DOR). Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter.A total of 119 patients were enrolled in the YERVOY and nivolumab cohort. The median age was 58 years (range: 21 to 88), with 32% ≥65 years of age and 9% ≥75 years of age; 59% were male and 92% were white. Baseline ECOG PS was 0 (45%) or 1 (55%), and 29% were reported to have Lynch Syndrome. Across the cohort, 69% received prior treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan; 10%, 40%, 24%, and 15% received 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease, respectively, and 29% had received an anti-EGFR antibody.Efficacy results are shown in Table 18.Table 18: Efficacy Results in MSI-H/dMMR Cohort of CHECKMATE-142a Estimated using the Clopper-Pearson method. b In the monotherapy cohort, 55% of the 20 patients with ongoing responses were followed for less than 12 months from the date of onset of response. In the combination cohort, 78% of the 51 patients with ongoing responses were followed for less than 12 months from the date of onset of response.YERVOY plus Nivolumab MSI-H/dMMR CohortAll Patients (n=119)Prior Treatment (Fluoropyrimidine, Oxaliplatin, and Irinotecan) (n=82)IRRC Overall Response Rate; n (%)58 (49%)38 (46%) (95% CI)a(39, 58)(35, 58) Complete Response (%)5 (4.2%)3 (3.7%) Partial Response (%)53 (45%)35 (43%)Duration of Response Proportion with ≥6 months response duration83%89% Proportion with ≥12b months response duration19%21%14.5 Hepatocellular Carcinoma CHECKMATE-040 (NCT01658878) was a multicenter, multiple cohort, open-label trial conducted in patients with HCC who progressed on or were intolerant to sorafenib. Additional eligibility criteria included histologic confirmation of HCC and Child-Pugh Class A cirrhosis. The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease, brain metastasis, a history of hepatic encephalopathy, clinically significant ascites, infection with HIV, or active co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HBV and hepatitis D virus (HDV); however, patients with only active HBV or HCV were eligible.The efficacy of YERVOY 3 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 1 mg/kg was evaluated in Cohort 4 of CHECKMATE-040. A total of 49 patients received the combination regimen, which was administered every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by single-agent nivolumab at 240 mg every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.The median age was 60 years (range: 18 to 80); 88% were male; 74% were Asian, and 25% were White. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (61%) or 1 (39%). Fifty-seven percent (57%) of patients had active HBV infection, 8% had active HCV infection, and 35% had no evidence of active HBV or HCV. The etiology for HCC was alcoholic liver disease in 16% and non-alcoholic liver disease in 6% of patients. Child-Pugh class and score was A5 for 82% and A6 for 18%; 80% of patients had extrahepatic spread; 35% had vascular invasion; and 51% had alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) levels ≥400 µg/L. Prior treatment history included surgery (74%), radiotherapy (29%), or local treatment (59%). All patients had received prior sorafenib, of whom 10% were unable to tolerate sorafenib; 29% of patients had received 2 or more prior systemic therapies.Efficacy results are shown in Table 19.Table 19: Efficacy Results - Cohort 4 of CHECKMATE-040a Confirmed by BICR. b Confidence interval is based on the Clopper and Pearson method.YERVOY and Nivolumab (Cohort 4) (n=49)Overall Response Rate per BICR,a n (%), RECIST v1.116 (33%) (95% CI)b(20, 48) Complete response4 (8%) Partial response12 (24%)Duration of Response per BICR,a RECIST v1.1n=16 Range (months)4.6, 30.5+ Percent with duration ≥6 months88% Percent with duration ≥12 months56% Percent with duration ≥24 months31%Overall Response Rate per BICR,a n (%), mRECIST17 (35%) (95% CI)b(22, 50) Complete response 6 (12%) Partial response11 (22%)14.6 Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer First-line Treatment of Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Expressing PD-L1 (≥1%): In Combination with NivolumabCHECKMATE-227 (NCT02477826) was a randomized, open-label, multi-part trial in patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC. The study included patients (18 years of age or older) with histologically confirmed Stage IV or recurrent NSCLC (per the 7th International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer [ASLC] classification), ECOG performance status 0 or 1, and no prior anticancer therapy. Patients were enrolled regardless of their tumor PD-L1 status. Patients with known EGFR mutations or ALK translocations sensitive to available targeted inhibitor therapy, untreated brain metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the study. Patients with treated brain metastases were eligible if neurologically returned to baseline at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment, and either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of <10 mg daily prednisone equivalents.Primary efficacy results were based on Part 1a of the study, which was limited to patients with PD-L1 tumor expression ≥1%. Tumor specimens were evaluated prospectively using the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay at a central laboratory. Randomization was stratified by tumor histology (non-squamous versus squamous). The evaluation of efficacy relied on the comparison between: •YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 6 weeks in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 2 weeks; or•Platinum-doublet chemotherapyChemotherapy regimens consisted of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6) for non-squamous NSCLC or gemcitabine (1000 or 1250 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 5) (gemcitabine was administered on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle) for squamous NSCLC.Study treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 24 months. Treatment continued beyond disease progression if a patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Patients who discontinued combination therapy because of an adverse event attributed to YERVOY were permitted to continue nivolumab as a single agent. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks from the first dose of study treatment for the first 12 months, then every 12 weeks until disease progression or study treatment was discontinued. The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures included PFS, ORR, and duration of response as assessed by BICR.In Part 1a, a total of 793 patients were randomized to receive either YERVOY in combination with nivolumab (n=396) or platinum-doublet chemotherapy (n=397). The median age was 64 years (range: 26 to 87) with 49% of patients ≥65 years and 10% of patients ≥75 years, 76% White, and 65% male. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (34%) or 1 (65%), 50% with PD-L1 ≥50%, 29% with squamous and 71% with non-squamous histology, 10% had brain metastases, and 85% were former/current smokers.The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for PD-L1 ≥1% patients randomized to the YERVOY and nivolumab arm compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy arm. The OS results are presented in Table 20 and Figure 4.Table 20: Efficacy Results (PD-L1 ≥1%) - CHECKMATE-227 Part 1aa Kaplan-Meier estimate. b Based on a stratified Cox proportional hazard model.YERVOY and Nivolumab (n=396)Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy (n=397)Overall Survival Events (%)258 (65%)298 (75%) Median (months)a (95% CI)17.1(15, 20.1)14.9(12.7, 16.7) Hazard ratio (95% CI)b0.79 (0.67, 0.94) Stratified log-rank p-value0.0066Figure 4: Overall Survival (PD-L1 ≥1%) - CHECKMATE-227BICR-assessed PFS showed a HR of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.97), with a median PFS of 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.1, 6.3) in the YERVOY and nivolumab arm and 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.6, 5.8) in the platinum-doublet chemotherapy arm. The BICR-assessed confirmed ORR was 36% (95% CI: 31, 41) in the YERVOY and nivolumab arm and 30% (95% CI: 26, 35) in the platinum-doublet chemotherapy arm. Median duration of response observed in the YERVOY and nivolumab arm was 23.2 months and 6.2 months in the platinum-doublet chemotherapy arm.ipilimumab-figure4.jpgFirst-line Treatment of Metastatic or Recurrent NSCLC: In Combination with Nivolumab and Platinum-Doublet ChemotherapyCHECKMATE-9LA (NCT03215706) was a randomized, open-label trial in patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC. The trial included patients (18 years of age or older) with histologically confirmed Stage IV or recurrent NSCLC (per the 7th International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer classification [IASLC]), ECOG performance status 0 or 1, and no prior anticancer therapy (including EGFR and ALK inhibitors) for metastatic disease. Patients were enrolled regardless of their tumor PD-L1 status. Patients with known EGFR mutations or ALK translocations sensitive to available targeted inhibitor therapy, untreated brain metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from the study. Patients with stable brain metastases were eligible for enrollment. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either:•YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 6 weeks, nivolumab 360 mg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks, and platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 2 cycles, or•platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.Platinum-doublet chemotherapy consisted of either carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6) and pemetrexed 500 mg/mg2, or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 for non-squamous NSCLC; or carboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 for squamous NSCLC. Patients with non-squamous NSCLC in the control arm could receive optional pemetrexed maintenance therapy. Stratification factors for randomization were tumor PD-L1 expression level (≥1% versus <1% or non‑quantifiable), histology (squamous versus non-squamous), and sex (male versus female). Study treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 2 years. Treatment could continue beyond disease progression if a patient was clinically stable and was considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Patients who discontinued combination therapy because of an adverse reaction attributed to YERVOY were permitted to continue nivolumab as a single agent as part of the study. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks from the first dose of study treatment for the first 12 months, then every 12 weeks until disease progression or study treatment was discontinued. The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures included PFS, ORR, and duration of response as assessed by BICR.A total of 719 patients were randomized to receive either YERVOY in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy (n=361) or platinum-doublet chemotherapy (n=358). The median age was 65 years (range: 26 to 86) with 51% of patients ≥65 years and 10% of patients ≥75 years. The majority of patients were White (89%) and male (70%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (31%) or 1 (68%), 57% had tumors with PD-L1 expression ≥1% and 37% had tumors with PD-L1 expression that was <1%, 32% had tumors with squamous histology and 68% had tumors with non-squamous histology, 17% had CNS metastases, and 86% were former or current smokers.The study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in OS, PFS, and ORR.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY12.1 Mechanism of ActionCTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activity. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase in T cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response.12.3 PharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of ipilimumab was studied in 785 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 doses. The PK of ipilimumab is linear in the dose range of 0.3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. Following administration of YERVOY every 3 weeks, the systemic accumulation was 1.5-fold or less. Steady-state concentrations of ipilimumab were reached by the third dose; the mean minimum concentration (Cmin) at steady state was 19.4 mcg/mL at 3 mg/kg and 58.1 mcg/mL at 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks.EliminationThe mean (percent coefficient of variation) terminal half-life (t1/2) was 15.4 days (34%) and then mean (percent coefficient of variation) clearance (CL) was 16.8 mL/h (38%). The CL of ipilimumab was unchanged in presence of anti-ipilimumab antibodies.Specific PopulationsThe CL of ipilimumab increased with increasing body weight supporting the recommended body weight (mg/kg) based dosing. The following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of ipilimumab: age (range: 23 to 88 years), sex, performance status, renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin [TB] >1 to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] or AST > ULN), previous cancer therapy, and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The effect of race was not examined due to limited data available in non-White racial groups. YERVOY has not been studied in patients with moderate (TB > 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) or severe (TB >3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment.Pediatric Patients: Based on a population PK analysis using available pooled data from 565 patients from four adult studies (n=521) and two pediatric studies (n=44), body weight normalized clearance of ipilimumab is comparable between adult and pediatric patients. In pediatric patients with a dosing regimen of 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the model simulated geometric mean (CV%) steady-state serum peak and trough concentrations of ipilimumab were 65.8 (17.6%) and 20.7 (33.1%) mcg/mL (for 2 to 6 years old), 70.1 (19.6%) and 19.6 (42.9%) mcg/mL (for 6 to <12 years old), and 73.3 (20.6%) and 17.8 (50.8%) mcg/mL (for 12 years and older), which are comparable to those in adult patients.Drug Interaction StudiesIpilimumab with NivolumabWhen YERVOY 1 mg/kg was administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the CL of ipilimumab was unchanged compared to when YERVOY was administered alone.When YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks was administered in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the CL of ipilimumab increased by 30% compared to YERVOY administered alone and the CL of nivolumab was unchanged compared to nivolumab administered alone.When YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks was administered in combination with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks and chemotherapy, the CL of ipilimumab increased by 22% compared to YERVOY administered alone and the CL of nivolumab was unchanged compared to nivolumab administered alone."
