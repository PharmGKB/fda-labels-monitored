        "11 DESCRIPTION Pembrolizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking antibody. Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody with an approximate molecular weight of 149 kDa. Pembrolizumab is produced in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) injection is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution for intravenous use. Each vial contains 100 mg of pembrolizumab in 4 mL of solution. Each 1 mL of solution contains 25 mg of pembrolizumab and is formulated in: L-histidine (1.55 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), sucrose (70 mg), and Water for Injection, USP."

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No studies have been performed to test the potential of pembrolizumab for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. Fertility studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab. In 1-month and 6-month repeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs; however, most animals in these studies were not sexually mature. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal models, inhibition of PD-1 signaling resulted in an increased severity of some infections and enhanced inflammatory responses. M. tuberculosis-infected PD-1 knockout mice exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type controls, which correlated with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory responses in these animals. PD-1 knockout mice have also shown decreased survival following infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Administration of pembrolizumab in chimpanzees with naturally occurring chronic hepatitis B infection resulted in two out of four animals with significantly increased levels of serum ALT, AST, and GGT, which persisted for at least 1 month after discontinuation of pembrolizumab."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of pembrolizumab was characterized using a population PK analysis with concentration data collected from 2993 patients with various cancers who received pembrolizumab doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 200 mg every 3 weeks. Steady-state concentrations of pembrolizumab were reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with an every 3-week regimen and the systemic accumulation was 2.1-fold. The peak concentration (C max ), trough concentration (C min ), and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at steady state (AUC ss ) of pembrolizumab increased dose proportionally in the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Distribution The geometric mean value (CV%) for volume of distribution at steady state is 6.0 L (20%). Elimination Pembrolizumab clearance (CV%) is approximately 23% lower [geometric mean, 195 mL/day (40%)] at steady state than that after the first dose [252 mL/day (37%)]; this decrease in clearance with time is not considered clinically important. The terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) is 22 days (32%). Specific Populations The following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of pembrolizumab: age (range: 15 to 94 years), sex, race (89% White), renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST > ULN or total bilirubin between 1 and 1.5 times ULN and any AST), or tumor burden. The impact of moderate or severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab is unknown. Pediatric Patients: Pembrolizumab concentrations with weight-based dosing at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks in pediatric patients (2 to 17 years) are comparable to those of adults at the same dose."

        "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA have been established in pediatric patients with cHL, PMBCL, MSI-H cancer, and TMB-H cancer. Use of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with cHL, PMBCL, MSI-H cancer, and TMB-H cancer is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of KEYTRUDA in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14.5 , 14.6 , 14.8 , 14.17) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . There is limited experience with KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients. In a trial (NCT02332668), 40 pediatric patients (16 children ages 2 years to less than 12 years and 24 adolescents ages 12 years to 18 years) with various cancers, including unapproved usages, were administered KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients received KEYTRUDA for a median of 3 doses (range: 1-17 doses), with 34 patients (85%) receiving KEYTRUDA for 2 doses or more. The safety profile in these pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults; adverse reactions that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in pediatric patients when compared to adults <65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), increased transaminases (28%) and hyponatremia (18%). The concentrations of pembrolizumab in pediatric patients were comparable to those observed in adult patients at the same dose regimen of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients have not been established in the other approved indications [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available human data informing the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity. In animal models, the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is important in the maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue (see Data ) . Human IgG4 (immunoglobulins) are known to cross the placenta; therefore, pembrolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KEYTRUDA to evaluate its effect on reproduction and fetal development. A literature-based assessment of the effects of the PD-1 pathway on reproduction demonstrated that a central function of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. Blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore, potential risks of administering KEYTRUDA during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related to the blockade of PD-1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 knockout mice. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to pembrolizumab may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or of altering the normal immune response."

Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3), life-threatening (Grade 4), or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In clinical studies enrolling 2799 patients with various cancers who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent, pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) patients, including Grade 1 (0.8%), Grade 2 (1.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis. The median time to onset was 3.3 months (range: 2 days to 19.3 months), and the median duration was 1.5 months (range: 1 day to 17.2+ months). Sixty-three (67%) of the 94 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with 50 of the 63 receiving high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 8 days (range: 1 day to 10.1 months) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) than in patients who did not receive prior thoracic radiation (2.9%). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 36 (1.3%) patients. Pneumonitis resolved in 55 (59%) of the 94 patients. In clinical studies enrolling 790 patients with NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent as first-line therapy for advanced disease, pneumonitis occurred in 65 (8.2%) patients, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients. Forty-eight of the 65 patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 5 days (range: 1 to 26 days). Pneumonitis occurred in 17% of patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation and 7.7% of patients who did not receive prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 29 (3.7%) patients. Pneumonitis resolved in 51% of the patients. In KEYNOTE-048 enrolling 300 patients with HNSCC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent pneumonitis occurred in 18 (6%) patients, including Grade 3 (1.3%), Grade 4 (0%), and Grade 5 (0.3%). Eight of the 18 patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 14 days (range: 1 to 77 days). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 2 (0.7%) patients. Pneumonitis resolved in 12 (66%) of the patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 15 (5.4%) patients of 276 patients with HNSCC receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grade 3 (1.1%), Grade 4 (0%), and Grade 5 (0.4%) pneumonitis. Four of the 15 patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 16 days (range: 2 to 32 days). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5 (1.8%) patients. Pneumonitis resolved in 12 (80%) of the patients. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis.

Thirteen (68%) of the 19 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with 12 of the 13 receiving high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 5 days (range: 1 to 26 days) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Hepatitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 6 (0.2%) patients. Hepatitis resolved in 15 (79%) of the 19 patients. Hepatotoxicity in Combination with Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib and consider administering corticosteroids as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. The median time to onset of increased ALT was 2.3 months (range: 7 days to 19.8 months). Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times ULN (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (3%) or axitinib (31%) administered as a single agent or with both (50%), 55% had no recurrence of ALT >3 times ULN . 5.4 Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary). Monitor for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) adrenal insufficiency and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) adrenal insufficiency [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) adrenal insufficiency. The median time to onset was 5.3 months (range: 26 days to 16.6 months), and the median duration was not reached (range: 4 days to 1.9+ years). Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.3% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients with adrenal insufficiency, including 9% who received high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone ≥40 mg per day or equivalent) for median duration of 4 days (range: 1 to 6 days) followed by corticosteroid taper. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 23% of the patients. Hypophysitis KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) hypophysitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. The median time to onset was 3.7 months (range: 1 day to 11.9 months), and the median duration was 4.7 months (range: 8+ days to 12.7+ months). Sixteen (94%) of the 17 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with 6 of the 16 receiving high-dose corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 4 (0.1%) patients. Hypophysitis resolved in 7 (41%) of the 17 patients. Thyroid Disorders KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) hyperthyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and Grade 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. The median time to onset was 1.4 months (range: 1 day to 21.9 months), and the median duration was 2.1 months (range: 3 days to 15.0+ months). Hyperthyroidism led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 2 (<0.1%) patients. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 71 (74%) of the 96 patients. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and Grade 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. The median time to onset was 3.5 months (range: 1 day to 18.9 months), and the median duration was not reached (range: 2 days to 27.7+ months). Hypothyroidism led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1 (<0.1%) patient. Hypothyroidism resolved in 48 (20%) of the 237 patients. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. The median time of onset was 1.2 months (range: 0.5 to 3.5 months). Type 1 Diabetes mellitus KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer anti-hyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.5 Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2), and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. The median time to onset was 5.1 months (range: 12 days to 12.8 months), and the median duration was 3.3 months (range: 12 days to 8.9+ months). Eight (89%) of the 9 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with 7 of the 8 receiving high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 15 days (range: 3 days to 4.0 months) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Nephritis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 3 (0.1%) patients. Nephritis resolved in 5 (56%) of the 9 patients. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% of 405 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum in the KEYNOTE-189 study, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 4 (0.5%) nephritis. The median time to onset was 3.2 months (range: 16 days to 11.1 months) and the duration ranged from 1.6 to 16.8+ months. Six (86%) of the 7 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with all 6 receiving high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 3 days (range: 1 to 17 days) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Nephritis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5 (1.2%) patients. Nephritis resolved in 2 (29%) of the 7 patients. 5.6 Immune-Mediated Skin Adverse Reactions Immune-mediated rashes, including SJS, TEN (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.7 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually occur during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, they may occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients treated with KEYTRUDA: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other trials, including cHL, and post-marketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA versus the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. 5.8 Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.9 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT Allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Allogeneic HSCT prior to treatment with KEYTRUDA In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD, including fatal GVHD, has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA versus the risk of possible GVHD in patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT. 5.10 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when KEYTRUDA is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled trials. 5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

If PD-L1 expression is not detected in an archival gastric cancer specimen, evaluate the feasibility of obtaining a tumor biopsy for PD-L1 testing. metastatic esophageal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ] . recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.12) ] . For the MSI-H/dMMR indications, select patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent based on MSI-H/dMMR status in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14.8 , 14.9) ]. For the TMB-H indication, select patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent based on TMB-H status in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14.17) ]. Because the effect of prior chemotherapy on test results for tumor mutation burden (TMB-H), MSI-H, or dMMR in patients with high-grade gliomas is unclear, it is recommended to test for these markers in the primary tumor specimens obtained prior to initiation of temozolomide chemotherapy in patients with high-grade gliomas. Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of PD-L1 expression and TMB status is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. An FDA-approved test for the detection of MSI-H or dMMR is not currently available. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Table 1: Recommended Dosage Indication Recommended Dosage of KEYTRUDA Duration/Timing of Treatment Monotherapy Adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 200 mg every 3 weeks 30-minute intravenous infusion or 400 mg every 6 weeks Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Adjuvant treatment of adult patients with melanoma 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks Until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 12 months Adult patients with NSCLC, SCLC, HNSCC, cHL, PMBCL, locally advanced or metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma, MSI-H or dMMR Cancer, MSI-H or dMMR CRC, Gastric Cancer, Esophageal Cancer, Cervical Cancer, HCC, MCC, TMB-H Cancer, or cSCC 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks Until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months Adult patients with high-risk BCG- unresponsive NMIBC 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks Until persistent or recurrent high-risk NMIBC, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months Pediatric patients with cHL, PMBCL, MSI-H Cancer, MCC, or TMB-H Cancer 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (up to a maximum of 200 mg) Until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months Combination Therapy Refer to the Prescribing Information for the agents administered in combination with KEYTRUDA for recommended dosing information, as appropriate.

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA as a single agent in 2799 patients in three randomized, open-label, active-controlled trials (KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, and KEYNOTE-010), which enrolled 912 patients with melanoma and 682 patients with NSCLC, and one single-arm trial (KEYNOTE-001), which enrolled 655 patients with melanoma and 550 patients with NSCLC. In addition to the 2799 patients, certain subsections in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS describe adverse reactions observed with exposure to KEYTRUDA as a single agent in two randomized, open-label, active-controlled clinical trials (KEYNOTE-042 and KEYNOTE-024), which enrolled 790 patients with NSCLC; in a non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort trial (KEYNOTE-012), a non-randomized, open-label, single-cohort trial (KEYNOTE-055), and two randomized, open-label, active-controlled trials (KEYNOTE-040 and KEYNOTE-048 single agent arms), which enrolled 909 patients with HNSCC; in two non-randomized, open-label trials (KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-087), which enrolled 241 patients with cHL; in combination with chemotherapy in a randomized, active-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-189), which enrolled 405 patients with nonsquamous NSCLC; in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-048 combination arm), which enrolled 276 patients with HNSCC; in combination with axitinib in a randomized, active-controlled trial (KEYNOTE 426), which enrolled 429 patients with RCC; and in post-marketing use. Across all trials, KEYTRUDA was administered at doses of 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks, or 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Among the 2799 patients, 41% were exposed for 6 months or more and 21% were exposed for 12 months or more. The data described in this section were obtained in eleven randomized, controlled trials (KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-010, KEYNOTE-042, KEYNOTE-045, KEYNOTE-177, KEYNOTE-048, KEYNOTE-189, KEYNOTE-407, KEYNOTE-181, and KEYNOTE-426) and twelve non-randomized, open-label trials (KEYNOTE-028, KEYNOTE-012, KEYNOTE-087, KEYNOTE-170, KEYNOTE-052, KEYNOTE-057, KEYNOTE-059, KEYNOTE-158, KEYNOTE-224, KEYNOTE-017, KEYNOTE-146, and KEYNOTE-629). The data described in this section also included a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-054) in which KEYTRUDA was administered for the adjuvant treatment of 509 patients with melanoma with involvement of lymph node(s) following complete surgical resection. In these trials, KEYTRUDA was administered at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks. Melanoma Ipilimumab-Naive Melanoma The safety of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who had not received prior ipilimumab and who had received no more than one prior systemic therapy was investigated in KEYNOTE-006. KEYNOTE-006 was a multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial where patients were randomized (1:1:1) and received KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=278) or KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (n=277) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses unless discontinued earlier for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (n=256) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients with autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C, were ineligible. The median duration of exposure was 5.6 months (range: 1 day to 11.0 months) for KEYTRUDA and similar in both treatment arms. Fifty-one and 46% of patients received KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks, respectively, for ≥6 months. No patients in either arm received treatment for more than one year. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 18 to 89); 60% male; 98% White; 32% had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value at baseline; 65% had M1c stage disease; 9% with history of brain metastasis; and approximately 36% had been previously treated with systemic therapy which included a BRAF inhibitor (15%), chemotherapy (13%), and immunotherapy (6%). In KEYNOTE-006, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the every 2 week and every 3 week schedule, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=555) of both KEYTRUDA arms. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA occurred in 9% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (≥1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). Tables 3 and 4 summarize selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients on KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-006. Table 3: Selected Adverse reactions occurring at same or higher incidence than in the ipilimumab arm Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥10% of Patients Receiving KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-006 Adverse Reaction KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks Ipilimumab n=555 n=256 All Grades Graded per NCI CTCAE v4.0 (%) Grades 3-4 (%) All Grades (%) Grades 3-4 (%) General Fatigue 28 0.9 28 3.1 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Rash Includes rash, rash erythematous, rash follicular, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash papular, rash pruritic, and exfoliative rash. 24 0.2 23 1.2 Vitiligo Includes skin hypopigmentation 13 0 2 0 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Arthralgia 18 0.4 10 1.2 Back pain 12 0.9 7 0.8 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Cough 17 0 7 0.4 Dyspnea 11 0.9 7 0.8 Metabolism and Nutrition Decreased appetite 16 0.5 14 0.8 Nervous System Headache 14 0.2 14 0.8 Other clinically important adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA were diarrhea (26%), nausea (21%), and pruritus (17%). Table 4: Selected Laboratory abnormalities occurring at same or higher incidence than in ipilimumab arm Laboratory Abnormalities Worsened from Baseline Occurring in ≥20% of Melanoma Patients Receiving KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-006 Laboratory Test Each test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at least one on-study laboratory measurement available: KEYTRUDA (520 to 546 patients) and ipilimumab (237 to 247 patients); hypertriglyceridemia: KEYTRUDA n=429 and ipilimumab n=183; hypercholesterolemia: KEYTRUDA n=484 and ipilimumab n=205.

Ipilimumab-Refractory Melanoma The safety of KEYTRUDA in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor, was investigated in KEYNOTE-002. KEYNOTE-002 was a multicenter, partially blinded (KEYTRUDA dose), randomized (1:1:1), active-controlled trial in which 528 patients received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg (n=178) or 10 mg/kg (n=179) every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (n=171), consisting of dacarbazine (26%), temozolomide (25%), paclitaxel and carboplatin (25%), paclitaxel (16%), or carboplatin (8%) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients with autoimmune disease, severe immune-related toxicity related to ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for greater than 12 weeks; medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or an active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C, were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.7 months (range: 1 day to 16.6 months) and to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 4.8 months (range: 1 day to 16.8 months). In the KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg arm, 36% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for ≥6 months and 4% were exposed for ≥12 months. In the KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg arm, 41% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for ≥6 months and 6% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for ≥12 months. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 15 to 89); 61% male; 98% White; 41% had an elevated LDH value at baseline; 83% had M1c stage disease; 73% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease (100% received ipilimumab and 25% a BRAF inhibitor); and 15% with history of brain metastasis. In KEYNOTE-002, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the 2 mg/kg dose and 10 mg/kg dose, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=357) of both KEYTRUDA arms. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation occurred in 12% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA; the most common (≥1%) were general physical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 14% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were dyspnea (1%), diarrhea (1%), and maculo-papular rash (1%). Tables 5 and 6 summarize adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients on KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-002.

Adjuvant Treatment of Resected Melanoma The safety of KEYTRUDA as a single agent was investigated in KEYNOTE-054, a randomized (1:1) double-blind trial in which 1019 patients with completely resected stage IIIA (>1 mm lymph node metastasis), IIIB or IIIC melanoma received 200 mg of KEYTRUDA by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (n=509) or placebo (n=502) for up to one year [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression or mucosal or ocular melanoma were ineligible. Seventy-six percent of patients received KEYTRUDA for 6 months or longer. The study population characteristics were: median age of 54 years (range: 19 to 88), 25% age 65 or older; 62% male; and 94% ECOG PS of 0 and 6% ECOG PS of 1. Sixteen percent had stage IIIA, 46% had stage IIIB, 18% had stage IIIC (1-3 positive lymph nodes), and 20% had stage IIIC (≥4 positive lymph nodes). Two patients treated with KEYTRUDA died from causes other than disease progression; causes of death were drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and autoimmune myositis with respiratory failure. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 14% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA; the most common (≥1%) were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 19% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (2.4%), pneumonitis (2%), increased ALT (1.4%), arthralgia (1.4%), increased AST (1.4%), dyspnea (1%), and fatigue (1%).

A total of 607 patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg, pemetrexed and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by KEYTRUDA and pemetrexed (n=405) or placebo, pemetrexed, and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by placebo and pemetrexed (n=202). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks was 7.2 months (range: 1 day to 20.1 months). Sixty percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA for ≥6 months. Seventy-two percent of patients received carboplatin. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 34 to 84), 49% age 65 or older; 59% male; 94% White and 3% Asian; and 18% with history of brain metastases at baseline. KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 20% of patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonitis (3%) and acute kidney injury (2%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 53% of patients; the most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (≥2%) were neutropenia (13%), asthenia/fatigue (7%), anemia (7%), thrombocytopenia (5%), diarrhea (4%), pneumonia (4%), increased blood creatinine (3%), dyspnea (2%), febrile neutropenia (2%), upper respiratory tract infection (2%), increased ALT (2%), and pyrexia (2%).

Safety data are available for the first 203 patients who received KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy (n=101) or placebo and chemotherapy (n=102). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 7 months (range: 1 day to 12 months). Sixty-one percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA for ≥6 months. A total of 139 of 203 patients (68%) received paclitaxel and 64 patients (32%) received paclitaxel protein-bound in combination with carboplatin. The study population characteristics were: median age of 65 years (range: 40 to 83), 52% age 65 or older; 78% male; 83% White; and 9% with history of brain metastases. KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 15% of patients, with no single type of adverse reaction accounting for the majority. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 43% of patients; the most common (≥2%) were thrombocytopenia (20%), neutropenia (11%), anemia (6%), asthenia (2%), and diarrhea (2%). The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were febrile neutropenia (6%), pneumonia (6%), and urinary tract infection (3%). The adverse reactions observed in KEYNOTE-407 were similar to those observed in KEYNOTE-189 with the exception that increased incidences of alopecia (47% vs. 36%) and peripheral neuropathy (31% vs. 25%) were observed in the KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy arm compared to the placebo and chemotherapy arm in KEYNOTE-407. Previously Untreated NSCLC The safety of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-042, a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1), active-controlled trial in 1251 patients with PD-L1 expressing, previously untreated stage III NSCLC who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation or metastatic NSCLC [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=636) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (n=615), consisting of pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by optional pemetrexed (n=312) or paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by optional pemetrexed (n=303) every 3 weeks. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations; autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 5.6 months (range: 1 day to 27.3 months). Forty-eight percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA 200 mg for ≥6 months. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 25 to 90), 45% age 65 or older; 71% male; and 64% White, 30% Asian, and 2% Black. Nineteen percent were Hispanic or Latino. Eighty-seven percent had metastatic disease (stage IV), 13% had stage III disease (2% stage IIIA and 11% stage IIIB), and 5% had treated brain metastases at baseline. KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 19% of patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonitis (3.0%), death due to unknown cause (1.6%), and pneumonia (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 33% of patients; the most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (≥2%) were pneumonitis (3.1%), pneumonia (3.0%), hypothyroidism (2.2%), and increased ALT (2.0%). The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (7%), pneumonitis (3.9%), pulmonary embolism (2.4%), and pleural effusion (2.2%). Tables 11 and 12 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients treated with KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-042.

A total of 991 patients received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg (n=339) or 10 mg/kg (n=343) every 3 weeks or docetaxel (n=309) at 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks. Patients with autoimmune disease, medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.5 months (range: 1 day to 22.4 months) and to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.5 months (range 1 day to 20.8 months). The data described below reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg in 31% of patients exposed to KEYTRUDA for ≥6 months. In the KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg arm, 34% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for ≥6 months. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 20 to 88), 42% age 65 or older; 61% male; 72% White and 21% Asian; and 8% with advanced localized disease, 91% with metastatic disease, and 15% with history of brain metastases. Twenty-nine percent received two or more prior systemic treatments for advanced or metastatic disease. In KEYNOTE-010, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=682). Treatment was discontinued for adverse reactions in 8% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most common adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). Tables 13 and 14 summarize adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients on KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-010.

SCLC Among the 131 patients with previously treated SCLC who received KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-158 Cohort G (n=107) and KEYNOTE-028 Cohort C1 (n=24) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 2 months (range: 1 day to 2.25 years). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with SCLC were similar to those occurring in patients with other solid tumors who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent. HNSCC First-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC The safety of KEYTRUDA, as a single agent and in combination with platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and FU chemotherapy, was investigated in KEYNOTE-048, a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1:1), active-controlled trial in patients with previously untreated, recurrent or metastatic HNSCC [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. A total of 576 patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks either as a single agent (n=300) or in combination with platinum and FU (n=276) every 3 weeks for 6 cycles followed by KEYTRUDA, compared to 287 patients who received cetuximab weekly in combination with platinum and FU every 3 weeks for 6 cycles followed by cetuximab. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 3.5 months (range: 1 day to 24.2 months) in the KEYTRUDA single agent arm and was 5.8 months (range: 3 days to 24.2 months) in the combination arm. Seventeen percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA single agent arm and 18% of patients in the combination arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA for ≥12 months. Fifty-seven percent of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy started treatment with carboplatin. KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 12% of patients in the KEYTRUDA single agent arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were sepsis (1.7%) and pneumonia (1.3%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 31% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (≥2%) were pneumonia (2.3%), pneumonitis (2.3%), and hyponatremia (2%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 16% of patients in the combination arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonia (2.5%), pneumonitis (1.8%), and septic shock (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 45% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (≥2%) were neutropenia (14%), thrombocytopenia (10%), anemia (6%), pneumonia (4.7%), and febrile neutropenia (2.9%).

Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible for KEYNOTE-012. The study population characteristics were: median age of 60 years (range: 20 to 84), 35% age 65 or older; 83% male; and 77% White, 15% Asian, and 5% Black. Sixty-one percent of patients had two or more lines of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting, and 95% had prior radiation therapy. Baseline ECOG PS was 0 (30%) or 1 (70%) and 86% had M1 disease. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, was similar between dosage regimens (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks); therefore, summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in 2799 patients with melanoma or NSCLC treated with KEYTRUDA as a single agent, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3-4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . cHL Among the 210 patients with cHL enrolled in KEYNOTE-087 [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] , the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 8.4 months (range: 1 day to 15.2 months). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of patients, and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26%. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, graft versus host disease and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock.

Patients with autoimmune disease or medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications were ineligible [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ] . Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or either radiographic or clinical disease progression. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 2.8 months (range: 1 day to 15.8 months). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 11% of patients. Eighteen patients (5%) died from causes other than disease progression. Five patients (1.4%) who were treated with KEYTRUDA experienced sepsis which led to death, and three patients (0.8%) experienced pneumonia which led to death. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 22% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were liver enzyme increase, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, fatigue, joint pain, and pneumonia. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were urinary tract infection, hematuria, acute kidney injury, pneumonia, and urosepsis. Immune-related adverse reactions that required systemic glucocorticoids occurred in 8% of patients, use of hormonal supplementation due to an immune-related adverse reaction occurred in 8% of patients, and 5% of patients required at least one steroid dose ≥40 mg oral prednisone equivalent.

The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 4.9 months (range: 0.03 to 35.2 months). Adverse reactions occurring in patients with TMB-H cancer were similar to those occurring in patients with other solid tumors who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent. cSCC Among the 105 patients with cSCC enrolled in KEYNOTE-629 [see Clinical Studies (14.18) ] , the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 5.8 months (range 1 day to 16.1 months). Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications were ineligible. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with cSCC were similar to those occurring in 2799 patients with melanoma or NSCLC treated with KEYTRUDA as a single agent. Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) that occurred at a higher incidence included lymphopenia (11%). 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to pembrolizumab in the studies described below with the incidences of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Trough levels of pembrolizumab interfere with the electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay results; therefore, a subset analysis was performed in the patients with a concentration of pembrolizumab below the drug tolerance level of the anti-product antibody assay. In clinical studies in patients treated with pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks, 27 (2.1%) of 1289 evaluable patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-pembrolizumab antibodies of whom six (0.5%) patients had neutralizing antibodies against pembrolizumab. There was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic profile or increased infusion reactions with anti-pembrolizumab binding antibody development."

        "13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal models, inhibition of PD-1 signaling resulted in an increased severity of some infections and enhanced inflammatory responses. M. tuberculosis-infected PD-1 knockout mice exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type controls, which correlated with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory responses in these animals. PD-1 knockout mice have also shown decreased survival following infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Administration of pembrolizumab in chimpanzees with naturally occurring chronic hepatitis B infection resulted in two out of four animals with significantly increased levels of serum ALT, AST, and GGT, which persisted for at least 1 month after discontinuation of pembrolizumab."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available human data informing the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity. In animal models, the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is important in the maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue (see Data ) . Human IgG4 (immunoglobulins) are known to cross the placenta; therefore, pembrolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KEYTRUDA to evaluate its effect on reproduction and fetal development. A literature-based assessment of the effects of the PD-1 pathway on reproduction demonstrated that a central function of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. Blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore, potential risks of administering KEYTRUDA during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related to the blockade of PD-1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 knockout mice. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to pembrolizumab may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or of altering the normal immune response. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of pembrolizumab in either animal or human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating KEYTRUDA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Contraception KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for at least 4 months following the final dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA have been established in pediatric patients with cHL, PMBCL, MSI-H cancer, and TMB-H cancer. Use of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients with cHL, PMBCL, MSI-H cancer, and TMB-H cancer is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of KEYTRUDA in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14.5 , 14.6 , 14.8 , 14.17) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . There is limited experience with KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients. In a trial (NCT02332668), 40 pediatric patients (16 children ages 2 years to less than 12 years and 24 adolescents ages 12 years to 18 years) with various cancers, including unapproved usages, were administered KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients received KEYTRUDA for a median of 3 doses (range: 1-17 doses), with 34 patients (85%) receiving KEYTRUDA for 2 doses or more. The safety profile in these pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults; adverse reactions that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in pediatric patients when compared to adults <65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), increased transaminases (28%) and hyponatremia (18%). The concentrations of pembrolizumab in pediatric patients were comparable to those observed in adult patients at the same dose regimen of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA in pediatric patients have not been established in the other approved indications [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 3991 patients with melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, cHL or urothelial carcinoma who were treated with KEYTRUDA in clinical studies, 46% were 65 years and over and 16% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Melanoma Ipilimumab-Naive Melanoma The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-006 (NCT01866319), a randomized (1:1:1), open-label, multicenter, active-controlled trial in 834 patients. Patients were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or to ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses unless discontinued earlier for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression could receive additional doses of treatment unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging. Randomization was stratified by line of therapy (0 vs. 1), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), and PD-L1 expression (≥1% of tumor cells [positive] vs. <1% of tumor cells [negative]) according to an investigational use only (IUO) assay. Key eligibility criteria were unresectable or metastatic melanoma; no prior ipilimumab; and no more than one prior systemic treatment for metastatic melanoma. Patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma were not required to have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. Patients with autoimmune disease; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; previous severe hypersensitivity to other monoclonal antibodies; and HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, were ineligible. Assessment of tumor status was performed at 12 weeks, then every 6 weeks through Week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS; as assessed by blinded independent central review [BICR] using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ]). Additional efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 18 to 89); 60% male; 98% White; 66% had no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease; 69% ECOG PS of 0; 80% had PD-L1 positive melanoma, 18% had PD-L1 negative melanoma, and 2% had unknown PD-L1 status using the IUO assay; 65% had M1c stage disease; 68% with normal LDH; 36% with reported BRAF mutation-positive melanoma; and 9% with a history of brain metastases. Among patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma, 139 (46%) were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA as compared to ipilimumab. Among the 91 patients randomized to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks with an objective response, response durations ranged from 1.4+ to 8.1+ months. Among the 94 patients randomized to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks with an objective response, response durations ranged from 1.4+ to 8.2 months. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 32 and Figure 1.

The treatment arms consisted of KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens: dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (26%), temozolomide 200 mg/m 2 orally once daily for 5 days every 28 days (25%), carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min intravenously plus paclitaxel 225 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks for four cycles then carboplatin AUC of 5 mg/mL/min plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks (25%), paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (16%), or carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks (8%). Randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), LDH levels (normal vs. elevated [≥110% ULN]) and BRAF V600 mutation status (wild-type [WT] or V600E). The trial included patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with progression of disease; refractory to two or more doses of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg or higher) and, if BRAF V600 mutation-positive, a BRAF or MEK inhibitor; and disease progression within 24 weeks following the last dose of ipilimumab. The trial excluded patients with uveal melanoma and active brain metastasis. Patients received KEYTRUDA until unacceptable toxicity; disease progression that was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging; withdrawal of consent; or physician's decision to stop therapy for the patient. Assessment of tumor status was performed at 12 weeks after randomization, then every 6 weeks through week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients on chemotherapy who experienced progression of disease were offered KEYTRUDA. The major efficacy outcomes were PFS as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and DoR. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 15 to 89), 43% age 65 or older; 61% male; 98% White; and 55% ECOG PS of 0 and 45% ECOG PS of 1. Twenty-three percent of patients were BRAF V600 mutation positive, 40% had elevated LDH at baseline, 82% had M1c disease, and 73% had two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease. The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA as compared to control arm. There was no statistically significant difference between KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg and chemotherapy or between KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg and chemotherapy in the OS analysis in which 55% of the patients who had been randomized to receive chemotherapy had crossed over to receive KEYTRUDA. Among the 38 patients randomized to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg with an objective response, response durations ranged from 1.3+ to 11.5+ months. Among the 46 patients randomized to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg with an objective response, response durations ranged from 1.1+ to 11.1+ months. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 33.

Patients were randomized to KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every three weeks or placebo for up to one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer 7 th edition (AJCC) stage (IIIA vs. IIIB vs. IIIC 1-3 positive lymph nodes vs. IIIC ≥4 positive lymph nodes) and geographic region (North America, European countries, Australia, and other countries as designated). Patients must have undergone lymph node dissection and, if indicated, radiotherapy within 13 weeks prior to starting treatment. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the whole population and in the population with PD-L1 positive tumors where RFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis) or death, whichever occurs first. Patients underwent imaging every 12 weeks after the first dose of KEYTRUDA for the first two years, then every 6 months from year 3 to 5, and then annually. The study population characteristics were: median age of 54 years (range: 19 to 88), 25% age 65 or older; 62% male; and 94% ECOG PS of 0 and 6% ECOG PS of 1. Sixteen percent had stage IIIA, 46% had stage IIIB, 18% had stage IIIC (1-3 positive lymph nodes), and 20% had stage IIIC (≥4 positive lymph nodes); 50% were BRAF V600 mutation positive and 44% were BRAF wild-type; and 84% had PD-L1 positive melanoma with TPS ≥1% according to an IUO assay. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in RFS for patients randomized to the KEYTRUDA arm compared with placebo. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 34 and Figure 3.

For patients with PD-L1 positive tumors, the HR was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.69); p<0.001. The RFS benefit for KEYTRUDA compared to placebo was observed regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Figure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Recurrence-Free Survival in KEYNOTE-054 Figure 3 14.2 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer First-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy The efficacy of KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy was investigated in KEYNOTE-189 (NCT02578680), a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled trial conducted in 616 patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status, who had not previously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease and in whom there were no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by smoking status (never vs. former/current), choice of platinum (cisplatin vs. carboplatin), and tumor PD-L1 status (TPS <1% [negative] vs. TPS ≥1%). Patients were randomized (2:1) to one of the following treatment arms: KEYTRUDA 200 mg, pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 , and investigator's choice of cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles followed by KEYTRUDA 200 mg and pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. KEYTRUDA was administered prior to chemotherapy on Day 1. Placebo, pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 , and investigator's choice of cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles followed by placebo and pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of KEYTRUDA was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Patients randomized to placebo and chemotherapy were offered KEYTRUDA as a single agent at the time of disease progression. Assessment of tumor status was performed at Week 6, Week 12, and then every 9 weeks thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR, as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 34 to 84), 49% age 65 or older; 59% male; 94% White and 3% Asian; 56% ECOG PS of 1; and 18% with history of brain metastases. Thirty-one percent had tumor PD-L1 expression TPS <1% [negative]. Seventy-two percent received carboplatin and 12% were never smokers. A total of 85 patients in the placebo and chemotherapy arm received an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy compared with placebo, pemetrexed, and platinum chemotherapy.

Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 status (TPS <1% [negative] vs. TPS ≥1%), choice of paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, and geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms; all study medications were administered via intravenous infusion: KEYTRUDA 200 mg and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles, and paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles or paclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles, followed by KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks. KEYTRUDA was administered prior to chemotherapy on Day 1. Placebo and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles and paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles or paclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles, followed by placebo every 3 weeks. Treatment with KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy or placebo and chemotherapy continued until RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined progression of disease as determined by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of KEYTRUDA was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. Patients randomized to the placebo and chemotherapy arm were offered KEYTRUDA as a single agent at the time of disease progression. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 6 weeks through Week 18, every 9 weeks through Week 45 and every 12 weeks thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measures were PFS and ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and OS. An additional efficacy outcome measure was DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 65 years (range: 29 to 88), 55% age 65 or older; 81% male; 77% White; 71% ECOG PS of 1; and 8% with a history of brain metastases. Thirty-five percent had tumor PD-L1 expression TPS <1%; 19% were from the East Asian region; and 60% received paclitaxel. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS, PFS and ORR in patients randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound chemotherapy compared with patients randomized to placebo with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound chemotherapy.

Only patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) by an immunohistochemistry assay using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit and who had not received prior systemic treatment for metastatic NSCLC were eligible. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations; autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of radiation in the thoracic region within the prior 26 weeks of initiation of study were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), histology (squamous vs. nonsquamous), geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia), and PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥50% vs. TPS 1 to 49%). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of either of the following platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens: Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 for a maximum of 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for patients with nonsquamous histologies; Paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 for a maximum of 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for patients with nonsquamous histologies. Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of KEYTRUDA was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. Treatment with KEYTRUDA could be reinitiated at the time of subsequent disease progression and administered for up to 12 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. The main efficacy outcome measure was OS in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% NSCLC, the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥20% NSCLC, and the overall population with TPS ≥1% NSCLC. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS and ORR in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% NSCLC, the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥20% NSCLC, and the overall population with TPS ≥1% NSCLC as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 25 to 90), 45% age 65 or older; 71% male; and 64% White, 30% Asian, and 2% Black. Nineteen percent were Hispanic or Latino. Sixty-nine percent had ECOG PS of 1; 39% with squamous and 61% with nonsquamous histology; 87% had M1 disease and 13% had Stage IIIA (2%) or Stage IIIB (11%) and who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation per investigator assessment; and 5% with treated brain metastases at baseline. Forty-seven percent of patients had TPS ≥50% NSCLC and 53% had TPS 1 to 49% NSCLC. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients (PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, TPS ≥20%, TPS ≥1%) randomized to KEYTRUDA as compared with chemotherapy. Table 37 and Figure 6 summarize the efficacy results in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% and in all randomized patients with TPS ≥1%.

In a pre-specified exploratory subgroup analysis for patients with TPS 1-49% NSCLC, the median OS was 13.4 months (95% CI: 10.7, 18.2) for the pembrolizumab group and 12.1 months (95% CI: 11.0, 14.0) in the chemotherapy group, with an HR of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.11). Figure 6: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Overall Survival in all Randomized Patients in KEYNOTE-042 (TPS ≥1%) Figure 6 KEYNOTE-024 The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was also investigated in KEYNOTE-024 (NCT02142738), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial in 305 previously untreated patients with metastatic NSCLC. The study design was similar to that of KEYNOTE-042, except that only patients whose tumors had high PD-L1 expression (TPS of 50% or greater) by an immunohistochemistry assay using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit were eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of any of the following platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens: Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for patients with nonsquamous histologies; Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks on Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for patients with nonsquamous histologies; Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks on Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles; Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles; Paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed maintenance (for nonsquamous histologies). Patients randomized to chemotherapy were offered KEYTRUDA at the time of disease progression. The main efficacy outcome measure was PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 65 years (range: 33 to 90), 54% age 65 or older; 61% male; 82% White and 15% Asian; 65% with ECOG PS of 1; 18% with squamous and 82% with nonsquamous histology and 9% with history of brain metastases. A total of 66 patients in the chemotherapy arm received KEYTRUDA at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both PFS and OS for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA as compared with chemotherapy.

Figure 7 Previously treated NSCLC The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-010 (NCT01905657), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 1033 patients with metastatic NSCLC that had progressed following platinum-containing chemotherapy, and if appropriate, targeted therapy for EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Eligible patients had PD-L1 expression TPS of 1% or greater by an immunohistochemistry assay using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. Patients with autoimmune disease; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 expression TPS ≥50% vs. PD-L1 expression TPS=1-49%), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), and geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia). Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks, KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks or docetaxel intravenously 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients randomized to KEYTRUDA were permitted to continue until disease progression that was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or confirmation of progression at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging or for up to 24 months without disease progression. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% and the overall population with TPS ≥1%. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% and the overall population with TPS ≥1%. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 20 to 88), 42% age 65 or older; 61% male; 72% White and 21% Asian; 66% ECOG PS of 1; 43% with high PD-L1 tumor expression; 21% with squamous, 70% with nonsquamous, and 8% with mixed, other or unknown histology; 91% metastatic (M1) disease; 15% with history of brain metastases; and 8% and 1% with EGFR and ALK genomic aberrations, respectively. All patients had received prior therapy with a platinum-doublet regimen, 29% received two or more prior therapies for their metastatic disease. Tables 39 and 40 and Figure 8 summarize efficacy results in the subgroup with TPS ≥50% population and in all patients, respectively.

The trials excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received either KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks (n=64) or 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks (n=19). Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of KEYTRUDA during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 8 weeks for the first 6 months in KEYNOTE-028, every 9 weeks for the first 12 months in KEYNOTE-158, and every 12 weeks thereafter for both studies. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 24 to 84); 40% age 65 or older; 64% male; 63% White, 25% Asian, and 2% Black; 30% ECOG PS of 0 and 69% ECOG PS of 1; 7% had M0 disease and 93% had M1 disease; and 16% had a history of brain metastases. Sixty-four percent received two prior lines of therapy and 36% received three or more lines of therapy; 60% received prior thoracic radiation therapy; 51% received prior radiation therapy to the brain. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 41.

Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥50% or <50%) according to the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit, HPV status according to p16 IHC (positive or negative), and ECOG PS (0 vs. 1). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment arms: KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks, and FU 1000 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion over 96 hours every 3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum and FU) Cetuximab 400 mg/m 2 intravenously as the initial dose then 250 mg/m 2 intravenously once weekly, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks, and FU 1000 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion over 96 hours every 3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum and FU) Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of KEYTRUDA was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed at Week 9 and then every 6 weeks for the first year, followed by every 9 weeks through 24 months. A retrospective re-classification of patients' tumor PD-L1 status according to CPS using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit was conducted using the tumor specimens used for randomization. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ) sequentially tested in the subgroup of patients with CPS ≥20, the subgroup of patients with CPS ≥1, and the overall population. The study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range: 20 to 94), 36% age 65 or older; 83% male; 73% White, 20% Asian and 2.4% Black; 61% had ECOG PS of 1; and 79% were former/current smokers. Twenty-two percent of patients' tumors were HPV-positive, 23% had PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, and 95% had Stage IV disease (Stage IVA 19%, Stage IVB 6%, and Stage IVC 70%). Eighty-five percent of patients' tumors had PD-L1 expression of CPS ≥1 and 43% had CPS ≥20. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy compared to those randomized to cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy at a pre-specified interim analysis in the overall population. Table 42 and Figure 9 summarize efficacy results for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy.

In addition, KEYNOTE-048 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for the subgroups of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 (HR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.80) and CPS ≥20 (HR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.82). Figure 9: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Overall Survival for KEYTRUDA plus Platinum/Fluorouracil in KEYNOTE-048 At the time of the protocol-specified final analysis. The trial also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 randomized to KEYTRUDA as a single agent compared to those randomized to cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy at a pre-specified interim analysis. At the time of the interim and final analyses, there was no significant difference in OS between the KEYTRUDA single agent arm and the control arm for the overall population.

Figure 9 Figure 10 Previously treated recurrent or metastatic HNSCC The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-012 (NCT01848834), a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort study that enrolled 174 patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who had disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy administered for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC or following platinum-containing chemotherapy administered as part of induction, concurrent, or adjuvant therapy. Patients with active autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, evidence of interstitial lung disease, or ECOG PS ≥2 were ineligible. Patients received KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=53) or 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=121) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. Patients without disease progression were treated for up to 24 months. Treatment with pembrolizumab could be reinitiated for subsequent disease progression and administered for up to 1 additional year. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 8 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR, and DoR. The study population characteristics were median age of 60 years, 32% age 65 or older; 82% male; 75% White, 16% Asian, and 6% Black; 87% had M1 disease; 33% had HPV positive tumors; 63% had prior cetuximab; 29% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 71% had an ECOG PS of 1; and the median number of prior lines of therapy administered for the treatment of HNSCC was 2. The ORR was 16% (95% CI: 11, 22) with a complete response rate of 5%. The median follow-up time was 8.9 months. Among the 28 responding patients, the median DoR had not been reached (range: 2.4+ to 27.7+ months), with 23 patients having responses of 6 months or longer. The ORR and DoR were similar irrespective of dosage regimen (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks) or HPV status. 14.5 Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-087 (NCT02453594), a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label trial in 210 patients with relapsed or refractory cHL. Patients with active, non-infectious pneumonitis, an allogeneic HSCT within the past 5 years (or > 5 years but with symptoms of GVHD), active autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, or an active infection requiring systemic therapy were ineligible for the trial. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression, or for up to 24 months in patients who did not progress. Disease assessment was performed every 12 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures (ORR, Complete Response Rate, and DoR) were assessed by BICR according to the 2007 revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. The study population characteristics were: median age of 35 years (range: 18 to 76), 9% age 65 or older; 54% male; 88% White; and 49% ECOG PS of 0 and 51% ECOG PS of 1. The median number of prior lines of therapy administered for the treatment of cHL was 4 (range: 1 to 12). Fifty-eight percent were refractory to the last prior therapy, including 35% with primary refractory disease and 14% whose disease was chemo-refractory to all prior regimens. Sixty-one percent of patients had undergone prior auto-HSCT, 83% had received prior brentuximab vedotin and 36% of patients had prior radiation therapy. Efficacy results for KEYNOTE-087 are summarized in Table 44. Table 44: Efficacy Results in KEYNOTE-087 Endpoint KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks n=210 Median follow-up time of 9.4 months Objective Response Rate ORR (95% CI) 69% (62, 75) Complete response rate 22% Partial response rate 47% Duration of Response Median in months (range) 11.1 (0.0+, 11.1) Based on patients (n=145) with a response by independent review 14.6 Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-170 (NCT02576990), a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial in 53 patients with relapsed or refractory PMBCL. Patients were not eligible if they had active non-infectious pneumonitis, allogeneic HSCT within the past 5 years (or >5 years but with symptoms of GVHD), active autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, or an active infection requiring systemic therapy. Patients were treated with KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression, or for up to 24 months for patients who did not progress. Disease assessments were performed every 12 weeks and assessed by BICR according to the 2007 revised IWG criteria. The efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR. The study population characteristics were: median age of 33 years (range: 20 to 61 years); 43% male; 92% White; and 43% ECOG PS of 0 and 57% ECOG PS of 1. The median number of prior lines of therapy administered for the treatment of PMBCL was 3 (range 2 to 8). Thirty-six percent had primary refractory disease, 49% had relapsed disease refractory to the last prior therapy, and 15% had untreated relapse. Twenty-six percent of patients had undergone prior autologous HSCT, and 32% of patients had prior radiation therapy. All patients had received rituximab as part of a prior line of therapy. For the 24 responders, the median time to first objective response (complete or partial response) was 2.8 months (range 2.1 to 8.5 months). Efficacy results for KEYNOTE-170 are summarized in Table 45.

The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of treatment during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Tumor response assessments were performed at 9 weeks after the first dose, then every 6 weeks for the first year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 74 years; 77% male; and 89% White. Eighty-seven percent had M1 disease, and 13% had M0 disease. Eighty-one percent had a primary tumor in the lower tract, and 19% of patients had a primary tumor in the upper tract. Eighty-five percent of patients had visceral metastases, including 21% with liver metastases. Reasons for cisplatin ineligibility included: 50% with baseline creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min, 32% with ECOG PS of 2, 9% with ECOG PS of 2 and baseline creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min, and 9% with other reasons (Class III heart failure, Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy, and Grade 2 or greater hearing loss). Ninety percent of patients were treatment naïve, and 10% received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Among the 370 patients, 30% (n = 110) had tumors that expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥10. PD-L1 status was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. The study population characteristics of these 110 patients were: median age of 73 years; 68% male; and 87% White. Eighty-two percent had M1 disease, and 18% had M0 disease. Eighty-one percent had a primary tumor in the lower tract, and 18% of patients had a primary tumor in the upper tract. Seventy-six percent of patients had visceral metastases, including 11% with liver metastases. Reasons for cisplatin ineligibility included: 45% with baseline creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min, 37% with ECOG PS of 2, 10% with ECOG PS of 2 and baseline creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min, and 8% with other reasons (Class III heart failure, Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy, and Grade 2 or greater hearing loss). Ninety percent of patients were treatment naïve, and 10% received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. The median follow-up time for 370 patients treated with KEYTRUDA was 7.8 months (range 0.1 to 20 months). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 46.

The study compares KEYTRUDA with or without platinum-based chemotherapy (i.e., cisplatin or carboplatin with gemcitabine) to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. The trial also enrolled a third arm of monotherapy with KEYTRUDA to compare to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. The independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) for the study conducted a review of early data and found that in patients classified as having low PD-L1 expression (CPS <10), those treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy had decreased survival compared to those who received platinum-based chemotherapy. The iDMC recommended to stop further accrual of patients with low PD-L1 expression in the monotherapy arm, however, no other changes were recommended, including any change of therapy for patients who had already been randomized to and were receiving treatment in the monotherapy arm. Previously Treated Urothelial Carcinoma The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-045 (NCT02256436), a multicenter, randomized (1:1), active-controlled trial in 542 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients were randomized to receive either KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=270) or investigator's choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens all given intravenously every 3 weeks (n=272): paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 (n=90), docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 (n=92), or vinflunine 320 mg/m 2 (n=90). Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of treatment during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed at 9 weeks after randomization, then every 6 weeks through the first year, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcomes were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and DoR. The study population characteristics were: median age of 66 years (range: 26 to 88), 58% age 65 or older; 74% male; 72% White and 23% Asian; 42% ECOG PS of 0 and 56% ECOG PS of 1; and 96% M1 disease and 4% M0 disease. Eighty-seven percent of patients had visceral metastases, including 34% with liver metastases. Eighty-six percent had a primary tumor in the lower tract and 14% had a primary tumor in the upper tract. Fifteen percent of patients had disease progression following prior platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Twenty-one percent had received 2 or more prior systemic regimens in the metastatic setting. Seventy-six percent of patients received prior cisplatin, 23% had prior carboplatin, and 1% were treated with other platinum-based regimens. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and ORR for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA as compared to chemotherapy. There was no statistically significant difference between KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy with respect to PFS. The median follow-up time for this trial was 9.0 months (range: 0.2 to 20.8 months). Table 47 and Figure 11 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-045.

BCG-unresponsive high-risk NMIBC was defined as persistent disease despite adequate BCG therapy, disease recurrence after an initial tumor-free state following adequate BCG therapy, or T1 disease following a single induction course of BCG. Adequate BCG therapy was defined as administration of at least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus either of: at least two of three doses of maintenance therapy or at least two of six doses of a second induction course. Prior to treatment, all patients had undergone transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove all resectable disease (Ta and T1 components). Residual CIS (Tis components) not amenable to complete resection was allowed. The trial excluded patients with muscle invasive (i.e., T2, T3, T4) locally advanced non-resectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, concurrent extra-vesical (i.e., urethra, ureter or renal pelvis) non-muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium, or autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity, persistent or recurrent high-risk NMIBC, or progressive disease. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 12 weeks for two years and then every 24 weeks for three years, and patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. The major efficacy outcome measures were complete response (as defined by negative results for cystoscopy [with TURBT/biopsies as applicable], urine cytology, and computed tomography urography [CTU] imaging) and duration of response. The study population characteristics were: median age of 73 years (range: 44 to 92); 44% age ≥75; 84% male; 67% White; and 73% and 27% with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, respectively. Tumor pattern at study entry was CIS with T1 (13%), CIS with high grade TA (25%), and CIS (63%). Baseline high-risk NMIBC disease status was 27% persistent and 73% recurrent. The median number of prior instillations of BCG was 12. The median follow-up time was 28.0 months (range: 4.6 to 40.5 months). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 48.

Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible across the five trials. Patients received either KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks or KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was either symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. A maximum of 24 months of treatment with KEYTRUDA was administered. For the purpose of assessment of anti-tumor activity across these 5 trials, the major efficacy outcome measures were ORR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and DoR.

Among these 149 patients, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 55 years, 36% age 65 or older; 56% male; 77% White, 19% Asian, and 2% Black; and 36% ECOG PS of 0 and 64% ECOG PS of 1. Ninety-eight percent of patients had metastatic disease and 2% had locally advanced, unresectable disease. The median number of prior therapies for metastatic or unresectable disease was two. Eighty-four percent of patients with metastatic CRC and 53% of patients with other solid tumors received two or more prior lines of therapy. The identification of MSI-H or dMMR tumor status for the majority of patients (135/149) was prospectively determined using local laboratory-developed, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for MSI-H status or immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests for dMMR. Fourteen of the 149 patients were retrospectively identified as MSI-H by testing tumor samples from a total of 415 patients using a central laboratory developed PCR test. Forty-seven patients had dMMR cancer identified by IHC, 60 had MSI-H identified by PCR, and 42 were identified using both tests. Efficacy results are summarized in Tables 50 and 51.

MSI or MMR tumor status was determined locally using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or investigator’s choice of the following chemotherapy regimens given intravenously every 2 weeks: mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and FU) or mFOLFOX6 in combination with either bevacizumab or cetuximab: Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 , leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 (or levoleucovorin 200 mg/m 2 ), and FU 400 mg/m 2 bolus on Day 1, then FU 2400 mg/m 2 over 46-48 hours. Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg on Day 1 or cetuximab 400 mg/m 2 on first infusion, then 250 mg/m 2 weekly. FOLFIRI (irinotecan, leucovorin, and FU) or FOLFIRI in combination with either bevacizumab or cetuximab: Irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 , leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 (or levoleucovorin 200 mg/m 2 ), and FU 400 mg/m 2 bolus on Day 1, then FU 2400 mg/m 2 over 46-48 hours. Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg on Day 1 or cetuximab 400 mg/m 2 on first infusion, then 250 mg/m 2 weekly. Treatment with KEYTRUDA or chemotherapy continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator or unacceptable toxicity. Patients treated with KEYTRUDA without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. Patients randomized to chemotherapy were offered KEYTRUDA at the time of disease progression. The main efficacy outcome measures were PFS (as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ) and OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR. A total of 307 patients were enrolled and randomized to KEYTRUDA (n=153) or chemotherapy (n=154). The baseline characteristics of these 307 patients were: median age of 63 years (range: 24 to 93), 47% age 65 or older; 50% male; 75% White and 16% Asian; 52% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 48% had an ECOG PS of 1; and 27% received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among 154 patients randomized to receive chemotherapy,143 received chemotherapy per the protocol. Of the 143 patients, 56% received mFOLFOX6, 44% received FOLFIRI, 70% received bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI, and 11% received cetuximab plus mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA compared with chemotherapy. At the time of the PFS analysis, the overall survival data were not mature (66% of the required number of events for the OS final analysis). The median follow-up time was 27.6 months (range: 0.2 to 48.3 months). Table 52 and Figure 12 summarize the key efficacy measures for KEYNOTE-177.

Previous treatment must have included a fluoropyrimidine and platinum doublet. HER2/neu positive patients must have previously received treatment with approved HER2/neu-targeted therapy. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression or with clinical evidence of ascites by physical exam were ineligible. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. Patients without disease progression were treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 6 to 9 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR, and DoR. Among the 259 patients, 55% (n = 143) had tumors that expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥1 and microsatellite stable (MSS) tumor status or undetermined MSI or MMR status. PD-L1 status was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. The baseline characteristics of these 143 patients were: median age of 64 years, 47% age 65 or older; 77% male; 82% White and 11% Asian; and 43% ECOG PS of 0 and 57% ECOG PS of 1. Eighty-five percent had M1 disease and 7% had M0 disease. Fifty-one percent had two and 49% had three or more prior lines of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting. For the 143 patients, the ORR was 13.3% (95% CI: 8.2, 20.0); 1.4% had a complete response and 11.9% had a partial response. Among the 19 responding patients, the DoR ranged from 2.8+ to 19.4+ months, with 11 patients (58%) having responses of 6 months or longer and 5 patients (26%) having responses of 12 months or longer. Among the 259 patients enrolled in KEYNOTE-059, 7 (3%) had tumors that were determined to be MSI-H. An objective response was observed in 4 patients, including 1 complete response. The DoR ranged from 5.3+ to 14.1+ months. 14.11 Esophageal Cancer KEYNOTE-181 The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-181 (NCT02564263), a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial that enrolled 628 patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer who progressed on or after one prior line of systemic treatment for advanced disease. Patients with HER2/neu positive esophageal cancer were required to have received treatment with approved HER2/neu targeted therapy. All patients were required to have tumor specimens for PD-L1 testing at a central laboratory; PD-L1 status was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. Patients with a history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis, active autoimmune disease, or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens, all given intravenously: paclitaxel 80-100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks, or irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 every 2 weeks. Randomization was stratified by tumor histology (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ESCC] vs. esophageal adenocarcinoma [EAC]/Siewert type I EAC of the gastroesophageal junction [GEJ]), and geographic region (Asia vs. ex-Asia). Treatment with KEYTRUDA or chemotherapy continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients randomized to KEYTRUDA were permitted to continue beyond the first RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined disease progression if clinically stable until the first radiographic evidence of disease progression was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. Patients treated with KEYTRUDA without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measure was OS evaluated in the following co-primary populations: patients with ESCC, patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 CPS ≥10, and all randomized patients. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS, ORR, and DoR, according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR. A total of 628 patients were enrolled and randomized to KEYTRUDA (n=314) or investigator's treatment of choice (n=314). Of these 628 patients, 167 (27%) had ESCC that expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥10. Of these 167 patients, 85 patients were randomized to KEYTRUDA and 82 patients to investigator's treatment of choice [paclitaxel (n=50), docetaxel (n=19), or irinotecan (n=13)]. The baseline characteristics of these 167 patients were: median age of 65 years (range: 33 to 80), 51% age 65 or older; 84% male; 32% White and 68% Asian; 38% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 62% had an ECOG PS of 1. Ninety percent had M1 disease and 10% had M0 disease. Prior to enrollment, 99% of patients had received platinum-based treatment and 84% had also received treatment with a fluoropyrimidine. Thirty-three percent of patients received prior treatment with a taxane. The observed OS hazard ratio was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.96) in patients with ESCC, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.94) in patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 CPS ≥10, and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.05) in all randomized patients. On further examination in patients whose ESCC tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥10), an improvement in OS was observed among patients randomized to KEYTRUDA as compared with chemotherapy. Table 53 and Figure 13 summarize the key efficacy measures for KEYNOTE-181 for patients with ESCC CPS ≥10.

With the exception of the number of prior lines of treatment, the eligibility criteria were similar to and the dosage regimen identical to KEYNOTE-181. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR. Among the 121 patients enrolled, 29% (n=35) had ESCC that expressed PD-L1 CPS ≥10. The baseline characteristics of these 35 patients were: median age of 65 years (range: 47 to 81), 51% age 65 or older; 71% male; 26% White and 69% Asian; 40% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 60% had an ECOG PS of 1. One hundred percent had M1 disease. The ORR in the 35 patients with ESCC expressing PD-L1 was 20% (95% CI: 8, 37). Among the 7 responding patients, the DoR ranged from 4.2 to 25.1+ months, with 5 patients (71%) having responses of 6 months or longer and 3 patients (57%) having responses of 12 months or longer. 14.12 Cervical Cancer The efficacy of KEYTRUDA was investigated in 98 patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer enrolled in a single cohort (Cohort E) in KEYNOTE-158 (NCT02628067), a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort trial. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of treatment during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 12 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR, and DoR. Among the 98 patients in Cohort E, 77 (79%) had tumors that expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 and received at least one line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. PD-L1 status was determined using the IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. The baseline characteristics of these 77 patients were: median age of 45 years (range: 27 to 75); 81% White, 14% Asian, and 3% Black; 32% ECOG PS of 0 and 68% ECOG PS of 1; 92% had squamous cell carcinoma, 6% adenocarcinoma, and 1% adenosquamous histology; 95% had M1 disease and 5% had recurrent disease; and 35% had one and 65% had two or more prior lines of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting. No responses were observed in patients whose tumors did not have PD-L1 expression (CPS <1). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 54 for patients with PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥1).

Patients with active autoimmune disease, greater than one etiology of hepatitis, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, or clinical evidence of ascites by physical exam were ineligible for the trial. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity, investigator-assessed confirmed disease progression (based on repeat scan at least 4 weeks from the initial scan showing progression), or completion of 24 months of KEYTRUDA. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR. The study population characteristics were: median age of 68 years, 67% age 65 or older; 83% male; 81% White and 14% Asian; and 61% ECOG PS of 0 and 39% ECOG PS of 1. Child-Pugh class and score were A5 for 72%, A6 for 22%, B7 for 5%, and B8 for 1% of patients. Twenty-one percent of the patients were HBV seropositive and 25% HCV seropositive. There were 9 patients (9%) who were seropositive for both HBV and HCV. For these 9 patients, all of the HBV cases and three of the HCV cases were inactive. Sixty-four percent (64%) of patients had extrahepatic disease, 17% had vascular invasion, and 9% had both. Thirty-eight percent (38%) of patients had alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels ≥400 mcg/L. All patients received prior sorafenib; of whom 20% were unable to tolerate sorafenib. No patient received more than one prior systemic therapy (sorafenib). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 55.

Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. Patients without disease progression were treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed at 13 weeks followed by every 9 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1. The study population characteristics were: median age of 71 years (range: 46 to 91), 80% age 65 or older; 68% male; 90% White; and 48% ECOG PS of 0 and 52% ECOG PS of 1. Fourteen percent had stage IIIB disease and 86% had stage IV. Eighty-four percent of patients had prior surgery and 70% had prior radiation therapy. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 56.

Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status. Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression within the last 2 years were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk categories (favorable versus intermediate versus poor) and geographic region (North America versus Western Europe versus \"Rest of the World\"). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks up to 24 months in combination with axitinib 5 mg orally, twice daily. Patients who tolerated axitinib 5 mg twice daily for 2 consecutive cycles (6 weeks) could increase to 7 mg and then subsequently to 10 mg twice daily. Axitinib could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity. Sunitinib 50 mg orally, once daily for 4 weeks and then off treatment for 2 weeks. Treatment with KEYTRUDA and axitinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of KEYTRUDA and axitinib was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline, after randomization at Week 12, then every 6 weeks thereafter until Week 54, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 26 to 90); 38% age 65 or older; 73% male; 79% White and 16% Asian; 19% and 80% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100, respectively; and patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 31% favorable, 56% intermediate and 13% poor. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR, as assessed by BICR. A statistically significant improvement in OS was demonstrated at the pre-specified interim analysis in patients randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib compared with sunitinib. The trial also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS and ORR. Table 57 and Figure 14 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-426. The median follow-up time was 12.8 months (range 0.1 to 22.0 months). Consistent results were observed across pre-specified subgroups, IMDC risk categories and PD-L1 tumor expression status.

Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients were treated with KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in combination with lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression as determined by the investigator. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. Administration of KEYTRUDA and lenvatinib was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. KEYTRUDA dosing was continued for a maximum of 24 months; however, treatment with lenvatinib could be continued beyond 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline and then every 6 weeks until week 24, followed by every 9 weeks thereafter. Among the 108 patients, 87% (n=94) had tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR, 10% (n=11) had tumors that were MSI-H or dMMR, and in 3% (n=3) the status was not known. Tumor MSI status was determined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Tumor MMR status was determined using an IHC test. The baseline characteristics of the 94 patients with tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR were: median age of 66 years, 62% age 65 or older; 86% White, 6% Black, 4% Asian, and 3% other races; and ECOG PS of 0 (52%) or 1 (48%). All 94 of these patients received prior systemic therapy for endometrial carcinoma: 51% had one, 38% had two, and 11% had three or more prior systemic therapies. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 58.

The trial excluded patients who previously received an anti-PD-1 or other immune-modulating monoclonal antibody, or who had an autoimmune disease, or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 12 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. The statistical analysis plan pre-specified ≥10 and ≥13 mutations per megabase using the FoundationOne CDx assay as cutpoints to assess TMB. Testing of TMB was blinded with respect to clinical outcomes. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR in patients who received at least one dose of KEYTRUDA as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. In KEYNOTE-158, 1050 patients were included in the efficacy analysis population. TMB was analyzed in the subset of 790 patients with sufficient tissue for testing based on protocol-specified testing requirements. Of the 790 patients, 102 (13%) had tumors identified as TMB-H, defined as TMB ≥10 mutations per megabase. Among the 102 patients with TMB-H advanced solid tumors, the study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range: 27 to 80), 34% age 65 or older; 34% male; 81% White; and 41% ECOG PS of 0 and 58% ECOG PS of 1. Fifty-six percent of patients had at least two prior lines of therapy. Efficacy results are summarized in Tables 59 and 60.

The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of KEYTRUDA during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 6 weeks during the first year, and every 9 weeks during the second year. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Among the 105 patients treated, the study population characteristics were: median age of 72 years (range: 29 to 95), 71% age 65 or older; 76% male; 71% White, 25% race unknown; 34% ECOG PS of 0 and 66% ECOG PS of 1. Forty-five percent of patients had locally recurrent only cSCC, 24% had metastatic only cSCC, and 31% had both locally recurrent and metastatic cSCC. Eighty-seven percent received one or more prior lines of therapy; 74% received prior radiation therapy. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 61.

        "MEDICATION GUIDE KEYTRUDA ® (key-true-duh) (pembrolizumab) injection This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: June 2020 What is the most important information I should know about KEYTRUDA? KEYTRUDA is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system. KEYTRUDA can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can sometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended. Call or see your doctor right away if you develop any symptoms of the following problems or these symptoms get worse: Lung problems (pneumonitis). Symptoms of pneumonitis may include: shortness of breath chest pain new or worse cough Intestinal problems (colitis) that can lead to tears or holes in your intestine. Signs and symptoms of colitis may include: diarrhea or more bowel movements than usual stools that are black, tarry, sticky, or have blood or mucus severe stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tenderness Liver problems, including hepatitis. Signs and symptoms of liver problems may include: yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes nausea or vomiting pain on the right side of your stomach area (abdomen) dark urine bleeding or bruising more easily than normal Hormone gland problems (especially the thyroid, pituitary, adrenal glands, and pancreas). Signs and symptoms that your hormone glands are not working properly may include: rapid heart beat weight loss or weight gain increased sweating feeling more hungry or thirsty urinating more often than usual hair loss feeling cold constipation your voice gets deeper muscle aches feeling very weak dizziness or fainting headaches that will not go away or unusual headache Kidney problems, including nephritis and kidney failure. Signs of kidney problems may include: change in the amount or color of your urine Skin problems. Signs of skin problems may include: rash itching blisters, peeling or skin sores painful sores or ulcers in your mouth or in your nose, throat, or genital area Problems in other organs. Signs and symptoms of these problems may include: changes in eyesight severe or persistent muscle or joint pains severe muscle weakness low red blood cells (anemia) swollen lymph nodes, rash or tender lumps on skin, cough, shortness of breath, vision changes, or eye pain (sarcoidosis) confusion, fever, muscle weakness, balance problems, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, memory problems, or seizures (encephalitis) pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs, or bladder or bowel problems, including the need to urinate more often, leaking of urine, trouble urinating, or constipation (myelitis) shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, feeling tired, or chest pain (myocarditis) Infusion (IV) reactions that can sometimes be severe and life-threatening. Signs and symptoms of infusion reactions may include: chills or shaking shortness of breath or wheezing itching or rash flushing dizziness fever feeling like passing out Rejection of a transplanted organ. People who have had an organ transplant may have an increased risk of organ transplant rejection. Your doctor should tell you what signs and symptoms you should report and monitor you, depending on the type of organ transplant that you have had. Complications, including graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), in people who have received a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic). These complications can be severe and can lead to death. These complications may happen if you underwent transplantation either before or after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Your doctor will monitor you for the following signs and symptoms: skin rash, liver inflammation, stomach-area (abdominal) pain, and diarrhea. Getting medical treatment right away may help keep these problems from becoming more serious. Your doctor will check you for these problems during treatment with KEYTRUDA. Your doctor may treat you with corticosteroid or hormone replacement medicines. Your doctor may also need to delay or completely stop treatment with KEYTRUDA, if you have severe side effects. What is KEYTRUDA? KEYTRUDA is a prescription medicine used to treat: a kind of skin cancer called melanoma. KEYTRUDA may be used: when your melanoma has spread or cannot be removed by surgery (advanced melanoma), or to help prevent melanoma from coming back after it and lymph nodes that contain cancer have been removed by surgery. a kind of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KEYTRUDA may be used with the chemotherapy medicines pemetrexed and a platinum as your first treatment when your lung cancer: has spread (advanced NSCLC), and is a type called \"nonsquamous\", and your tumor does not have an abnormal \"EGFR\" or \"ALK\" gene. KEYTRUDA may be used with the chemotherapy medicines carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound as your first treatment when your lung cancer: has spread (advanced NSCLC), and is a type called \"squamous\".

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Based on the modeling of dose/exposure efficacy and safety relationships and observed pharmacokinetic data from an interim analysis of 41 patients with melanoma treated with pembrolizumab 400 mg every 6 weeks, there are no anticipated clinically significant differences in efficacy and safety between pembrolizumab doses of 200 mg or 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics (PK) of pembrolizumab was characterized using a population PK analysis with concentration data collected from 2993 patients with various cancers who received pembrolizumab doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 200 mg every 3 weeks. Steady-state concentrations of pembrolizumab were reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with an every 3-week regimen and the systemic accumulation was 2.1-fold. The peak concentration (C max ), trough concentration (C min ), and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at steady state (AUC ss ) of pembrolizumab increased dose proportionally in the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Distribution The geometric mean value (CV%) for volume of distribution at steady state is 6.0 L (20%). Elimination Pembrolizumab clearance (CV%) is approximately 23% lower [geometric mean, 195 mL/day (40%)] at steady state than that after the first dose [252 mL/day (37%)]; this decrease in clearance with time is not considered clinically important. The terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) is 22 days (32%). Specific Populations The following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of pembrolizumab: age (range: 15 to 94 years), sex, race (89% White), renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST > ULN or total bilirubin between 1 and 1.5 times ULN and any AST), or tumor burden. The impact of moderate or severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab is unknown. Pediatric Patients: Pembrolizumab concentrations with weight-based dosing at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks in pediatric patients (2 to 17 years) are comparable to those of adults at the same dose."
