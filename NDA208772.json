        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with brigatinib. Treatment with brigatinib resulted in chromosomal damage in an in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus in the rat, but was not mutagenic in the Ames or in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration tests. Dedicated animal fertility studies were not conducted with brigatinib. Testicular toxicity was observed in repeat-dose animal studies at doses resulting in exposure as low as 0.2 times the exposure in patients at the 180 mg dose. In rats, findings included lower weight of testes, seminal vesicles and prostate gland, and testicular tubular degeneration; these effects were not reversible during the 2 month recovery period. In monkeys, findings included reduced size of testes along with microscopic evidence of hypospermatogenesis; these effects were reversible during the recovery period."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Brigatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity at clinically achievable concentrations against multiple kinases including ALK, ROS1, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and FLT-3 as well as EGFR deletion and point mutations. Brigatinib inhibited autophosphorylation of ALK and ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT3, AKT, ERK1/2, and S6 in in vitro and in vivo assays. Brigatinib also inhibited the in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenograft growth in mice. At clinically achievable concentrations (â‰¤500 nM), brigatinib inhibited the in vitro viability of cells expressing EML4-ALK and 17 mutant forms associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors including crizotinib, as well as EGFR-Del (E746-A750), ROS1-L2026M, FLT3-F691L, and FLT3-D835Y. Brigatinib exhibited in vivo antitumor activity against 4 mutant forms of EML4-ALK, including G1202R and L1196M mutants identified in NSCLC tumors in patients who have progressed on crizotinib. Brigatinib also reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival in mice implanted intracranially with an ALK-driven tumor cell line."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The geometric mean (CV%) steady-state maximum concentration (C max ) of brigatinib at ALUNBRIG doses of 90 mg and 180 mg once daily was 552 (49%) ng/mL and 1452 (60%) ng/mL, respectively, and the corresponding area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-Tau ) was 8165 (45%) ngâˆ™h/mL and 20276 (62%) ngâˆ™h/mL. After a single dose and multiple dosing of ALUNBRIG, systemic exposure of brigatinib was dose proportional over the dose range of 60 mg (0.3 times the recommended dose of 180 mg) to 240 mg (1.3 times the recommended dose of 180 mg) once daily. The mean accumulation ratio after repeat dosing was 1.9 to 2.4. Absorption Following administration of single oral doses of ALUNBRIG of 30 mg to 240 mg, the median time to peak concentration (T max ) ranged from 1 to 4 hours. Effect of Food Brigatinib C max was reduced by 13% with no effect on AUC in healthy subjects administered ALUNBRIG after a high fat meal (approximately 920 calories, 58 grams carbohydrate, 59 grams fat and 40 grams protein) compared to the C max and AUC after overnight fasting. Distribution Brigatinib is 91% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is not concentration-dependent. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.69. Following oral administration of ALUNBRIG 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent volume of distribution (V z/ F) of brigatinib at steady-state was 307 L. Elimination Following oral administration of ALUNBRIG 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of brigatinib at steady-state is 8.9 L/h and the mean plasma elimination half-life is 25 hours. Metabolism Brigatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in vitro . Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled brigatinib to healthy subjects, N-demethylation and cysteine conjugation were the two major metabolic pathways. Unchanged brigatinib (92%) was the major circulating radioactive component. Excretion Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled brigatinib to healthy subjects, 65% of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 25% of the administered dose was recovered in urine. Unchanged brigatinib represented 41% and 86% of the total radioactivity in feces and urine, respectively. Specific Populations Age, race, sex, body weight, and albumin concentration have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following a single dose of ALUNBRIG 90 mg, unbound brigatinib systemic exposure (AUC 0-INF ) was 37% higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Unbound brigatinib systemic exposure (AUC 0-INF ) was similar between subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Following a single dose of ALUNBRIG 90 mg, unbound brigatinib systemic exposure (AUC 0-INF ) was 86% higher in subjects with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15 to 29 mL/min] compared to subjects with normal renal function. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, brigatinib exposures were similar among 125 subjects with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to 89 mL/min), 34 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min) and 270 subjects with normal renal function (CLcr â‰¥90 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors on Brigatinib: Coadministration of 200 mg twice daily doses of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) with a single 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG increased brigatinib C max by 21% and AUC 0-INF by 101%, relative to a 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . A moderate CYP3A inhibitor is predicted to increase the AUC of brigatinib by approximately 40%. Effect of Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors on Brigatinib: Coadministration of 600 mg twice daily doses of gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) with a single 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG decreased brigatinib C max by 41% and AUC 0-INF by 12%, relative to a 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone. The effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib is not clinically meaningful and the underlying mechanism for the decreased exposure of brigatinib is unknown. Effect of Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers on Brigatinib: Coadministration of 600 mg daily doses of rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer) with a single 180 mg dose of ALUNBRIG decreased brigatinib C max by 60% and AUC 0-INF by 80%, relative to a 180 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . A moderate CYP3A inducer is predicted to decrease the AUC of brigatinib by approximately 50%. In Vitro Studies Effect of Brigatinib on CYP Enzymes: Brigatinib, at clinically relevant plasma concentrations, induced CYP3A via activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR). Brigatinib may also induce CYP2C enzymes via the same mechanism at clinically relevant concentrations. Brigatinib did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. Effect of P-glycoprotein and BCRP Inhibitors on Brigatinib: Brigatinib is a substrate of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Given that brigatinib exhibits high solubility and high permeability in vitro , P-gp and BCRP inhibitors are unlikely to increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib. Effect of Other Transporters on Brigatinib: Brigatinib is not a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), organic anion transporter (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation transporter (OCT1, OCT2), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE1, MATE2K), or bile salt export pump (BSEP). Effect of Brigatinib on Transporters: Brigatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OCT1, MATE1, and MATE2K in vitro . Therefore, brigatinib may have the potential to increase concentrations of coadministered substrates of these transporters. Brigatinib at clinically relevant concentrations did not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 or BSEP."

There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Administration of brigatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in dose-related skeletal anomalies at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily) as well as increased post-implantation loss, malformations, and decreased fetal body weight at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human exposure at 180 mg once daily) or greater (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in which pregnant rats were administered daily doses of brigatinib during organogenesis, dose-related skeletal (incomplete ossification, small incisors) and visceral anomalies were observed at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily). Malformations observed at 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human AUC at 180 mg once daily) included anasarca (generalized subcutaneous edema), anophthalmia (absent eyes), forelimb hyperflexion, small, short and/or bent limbs, multiple fused ribs, bent scapulae, omphalocele (intestine protruding into umbilicus), and gastroschisis (intestines protruding through a defect in the abdominal wall) along with visceral findings of moderate bilateral dilatation of the lateral ventricles."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis : Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms, particularly during the first week of treatment. Withhold ALUNBRIG for new or worsening respiratory symptoms and promptly evaluate for ILD/pneumonitis. Upon recovery, either dose reduce or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Hypertension : Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and then at least monthly during treatment. For severe hypertension, withhold ALUNBRIG, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) Bradycardia : Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly during treatment. If symptomatic, withhold ALUNBRIG, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue. ( 2.3 , 5.3 ) Visual Disturbance : Advise patients to report visual symptoms. Withhold ALUNBRIG and obtain ophthalmologic evaluation, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. ( 2.3 , 5.4 ) Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation : Monitor CPK levels regularly during treatment. Based on the severity and with muscle pain or weakness, withhold ALUNBRIG, then resume or reduce dose. ( 2.3 , 5.5 ) Pancreatic Enzymes Elevation : Monitor lipase and amylase levels regularly during treatment. Based on the severity, withhold ALUNBRIG, then resume or reduce dose. ( 2.3 , 5.6 ) Hyperglycemia : Assess fasting serum glucose prior to starting ALUNBRIG and regularly during treatment. If not adequately controlled with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG, then consider dose reduction or permanently discontinue, based on severity. ( 2.3 , 5.7 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use a non-hormonal method of effective contraception. ( 5.8 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, and fatal pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have occurred with ALUNBRIG. In Trial ALTA 1L, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 5.1% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG. ILD/pneumonitis occurred within 8 days of initiation of ALUNBRIG in 2.9% of patients, with Grade 3 to 4 reactions occurring in 2.2% of patients. In Trial ALTA, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group (90 mg once daily) and 9.1% of patients in the 90â†’180 mg group (180 mg once daily with 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily). Adverse reactions consistent with possible ILD/pneumonitis occurred within 9 days of initiation of ALUNBRIG (median onset was 2 days) in 6.4% of patients, with Grade 3 to 4 reactions occurring in 2.7%. Monitor for new or worsening respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough, etc.), particularly during the first week of initiating ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG in any patient with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, and promptly evaluate for ILD/pneumonitis or other causes of respiratory symptoms (e.g., pulmonary embolism, tumor progression, and infectious pneumonia). For Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis, either resume ALUNBRIG with dose reduction according to Table 1 after recovery to baseline or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis or recurrence of Grade 1 or 2 ILD/pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.2 Hypertension In ALTA 1L, hypertension was reported in 32% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG; Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 13% of patients. In ALTA, hypertension was reported in 11% of patients in the 90 mg group who received ALUNBRIG and 21% of patients in the 90â†’180 mg group. Grade 3 hypertension occurred in 5.9% of patients overall. Control blood pressure prior to treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and at least monthly thereafter during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 hypertension despite optimal antihypertensive therapy. Upon resolution or improvement to Grade 1, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose. Consider permanent discontinuation of treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 hypertension or recurrence of Grade 3 hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Use caution when administering ALUNBRIG in combination with antihypertensive agents that cause bradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.3 Bradycardia In ALTA 1L, heart rates less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) occurred in 8.1% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG. Grade 3 bradycardia occurred in 1 patient (0.7%). In ALTA, heart rates less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) occurred in 5.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 7.6% of patients in the 90â†’180 mg group. Grade 2 bradycardia occurred in 1 (0.9%) patient in the 90 mg group. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Monitor patients more frequently if concomitant use of drug known to cause bradycardia cannot be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . For symptomatic bradycardia, withhold ALUNBRIG and review concomitant medications for those known to cause bradycardia. If a concomitant medication known to cause bradycardia is identified and discontinued or dose adjusted, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia; otherwise, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG following resolution of symptomatic bradycardia. Discontinue ALUNBRIG for life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.4 Visual Disturbance In ALTA 1L, Grade 1 or 2 adverse reactions leading to visual disturbance including blurred vision, photophobia, photopsia, and reduced visual acuity were reported in 7.4% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG. In ALTA, adverse reactions leading to visual disturbance including blurred vision, diplopia, and reduced visual acuity, were reported in 7.3% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and 10% of patients in the 90â†’180 mg group. Grade 3 macular edema and cataract occurred in 1 patient each in the 90â†’180 mg group. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms. Withhold ALUNBRIG and obtain an ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with new or worsening visual symptoms of Grade 2 or greater severity. Upon recovery of Grade 2 or Grade 3 visual disturbances to Grade 1 severity or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue treatment with ALUNBRIG for Grade 4 visual disturbances [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.5 Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation In ALTA 1L, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation occurred in 81% of patients who received ALUNBRIG. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation was 24%. Dose reduction for CPK elevation occurred in 15% of patients. In ALTA, CPK elevation occurred in 27% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG in the 90 mg group and 48% of patients in the 90 mgâ†’180 mg group. The incidence of Grade 3-4 CPK elevation was 2.8% in the 90 mg group and 12% in the 90â†’180 mg group. Dose reduction for CPK elevation occurred in 1.8% of patients in the 90 mg group and 4.5% in the 90â†’180 mg group. Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Monitor CPK levels during ALUNBRIG treatment. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation with Grade 2 or higher muscle pain or weakness. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 CPK elevation or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose or at a reduced dose as described in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.6 Pancreatic Enzymes Elevation In ALTA 1L, amylase elevation occurred in 52% of patients and Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation occurred in 6.8% of patients. Lipase elevations occurred in 59% of patients and Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurred in 17% of patients. In ALTA, amylase elevation occurred in 27% of patients in the 90 mg group and 39% of patients in the 90â†’180 mg group. Lipase elevations occurred in 21% of patients in the 90 mg group and 45% of patients in the 90â†’180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation occurred in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 2.7% of patients in the 90â†’180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurred in 4.6% of patients in the 90 mg group and 5.5% of patients in the 90â†’180 mg group. Monitor lipase and amylase during treatment with ALUNBRIG. Withhold ALUNBRIG for Grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzyme elevation. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose or at a reduced dose as described in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.7 Hyperglycemia In ALTA 1L, 56% of patients who received ALUNBRIG experienced new or worsening hyperglycemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory assessment of serum fasting glucose levels, occurred in 7.5% of patients. In ALTA, 43% of patients who received ALUNBRIG experienced new or worsening hyperglycemia. Grade 3 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory assessment of serum fasting glucose levels, occurred in 3.7% of patients. Two of 20 (10%) patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance at baseline required initiation of insulin while receiving ALUNBRIG. Assess fasting serum glucose prior to initiation of ALUNBRIG and monitor periodically thereafter. Initiate or optimize antihyperglycemic medications as needed. If adequate hyperglycemic control cannot be achieved with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG until adequate hyperglycemic control is achieved and consider reducing the dose of ALUNBRIG as described in Table 1 or permanently discontinuing ALUNBRIG [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Administration of brigatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in dose-related skeletal anomalies at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily), as well as increased post-implantation loss, malformations, and decreased fetal body weight at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human exposure at 180 mg once daily) or higher. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months following the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of ALUNBRIG [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]."

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days; then increase to 180 mg orally once daily. May be taken with or without food. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with ALUNBRIG based on the presence of ALK positivity in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of ALK rearrangements in NSCLC is available at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage for ALUNBRIG is: 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days; then increase the dose to 180 mg orally once daily. Administer ALUNBRIG until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If ALUNBRIG is interrupted for 14 days or longer for reasons other than adverse reactions, resume treatment at 90 mg once daily for 7 days before increasing to the previously tolerated dose. ALUNBRIG may be taken with or without food. Instruct patients to swallow tablets whole. Do not crush or chew tablets. If a dose of ALUNBRIG is missed or vomiting occurs after taking a dose, do not administer an additional dose and take the next dose of ALUNBRIG at the scheduled time. 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions ALUNBRIG dosage reductions for adverse reactions are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Recommended ALUNBRIG Dosage Reductions Dosage Reduction Dosage First Second Third 90 mg once daily 60 mg once daily permanently discontinue N/A Not applicable 180 mg once daily 120 mg once daily 90 mg once daily 60 mg once daily Once reduced for adverse reactions, do not subsequently increase the dosage of ALUNBRIG. Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG if patients are unable to tolerate the 60 mg once daily dose. Recommendations for dosage modifications of ALUNBRIG for the management of adverse reactions are provided in Table 2. Table 2: Recommended ALUNBRIG Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction Severity Graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4). Dosage Modifications bpm = beats per minute; DBP = diastolic blood pressure; HR = heart rate; SBP = systolic blood pressure; ULN = upper limit of normal Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) /Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] Grade 1 If new pulmonary symptoms occur during the first 7 days of treatment, withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to baseline, then resume at same dose and do not escalate to 180 mg if ILD/pneumonitis is suspected. If new pulmonary symptoms occur after the first 7 days of treatment, withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to baseline, then resume at same dose. If ILD/pneumonitis recurs, permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Grade 2 If new pulmonary symptoms occur during the first 7 days of treatment, withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to baseline. Resume at next lower dose (Table 1) and do not dose escalate if ILD/pneumonitis is suspected. If new pulmonary symptoms occur after the first 7 days of treatment, withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to baseline. If ILD/pneumonitis is suspected, resume at next lower dose (Table 1) ; otherwise, resume at same dose. If ILD/pneumonitis recurs, permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Grade 3 or 4 Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG for ILD/pneumonitis. Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Grade 3 hypertension (SBP greater than or equal to 160 mmHg or DBP greater than or equal to 100 mmHg, medical intervention indicated, more than one antihypertensive drug, or more intensive therapy than previously used indicated) Withhold ALUNBRIG until hypertension has recovered to Grade 1 or less (SBP less than 140 mmHg and DBP less than 90 mmHg), then resume ALUNBRIG at the same dose. Recurrence: withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to Grade 1 or less, and resume at next lower dose (Table 1) or permanently discontinue treatment. Grade 4 hypertension (life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated) Withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to Grade 1 or less, and resume at next lower dose (Table 1) or permanently discontinue treatment. Recurrence: permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG for recurrence of Grade 4 hypertension. Bradycardia (HR less than 60 bpm) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Symptomatic bradycardia Withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a resting heart rate of 60 bpm or above. If a concomitant medication known to cause bradycardia is identified and discontinued or dose-adjusted, resume ALUNBRIG at same dose upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to resting heart rate of 60 bpm or above. If no concomitant medication known to cause bradycardia is identified, or if contributing concomitant medications are not discontinued or dose-adjusted, resume ALUNBRIG at next lower dose (Table 1) upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to resting heart rate of 60 bpm or above. Bradycardia with life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG if no contributing concomitant medication is identified. If contributing concomitant medication is identified and discontinued or dose-adjusted, resume ALUNBRIG at next lower dose (Table 1) upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a resting heart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent monitoring as clinically indicated. Recurrence: permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Visual Disturbance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Grade 2 or 3 visual disturbance Withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to Grade 1 or baseline, then resume at the next lower dose (Table 1) . Grade 4 visual disturbance Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevation (greater than 5 Ã— ULN) with Grade 2 or higher muscle pain or weakness Withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to Grade 1 or less (less than or equal to 2.5 Ã— ULN) CPK elevation or to baseline, then resume ALUNBRIG at same dose. Recurrence: Withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to Grade 1 or less (less than or equal to 2.5 Ã— ULN) CPK elevation or to baseline, then resume ALUNBRIG at the next lower dose (Table 1) . Lipase/Amylase Elevation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Grade 3 lipase or amylase elevation (greater than 2 Ã— ULN) Withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to Grade 1 or less (less than or equal to 1.5 Ã— ULN) or to baseline, then resume ALUNBRIG at same dose. Recurrence: Withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to Grade 1 or less (less than or equal to 1.5 Ã— ULN) or to baseline, then resume ALUNBRIG at next lower dose (Table 1) . Grade 4 lipase or amylase elevation (greater than 5 Ã— ULN) Withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to Grade 1 or less (less than or equal to 1.5 Ã— ULN) or to baseline, then resume ALUNBRIG at next lower dose (Table 1) . Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Grade 3 (greater than 250 mg/dL or 13.9 mmol/L) or 4 If adequate hyperglycemic control cannot be achieved with optimal medical management, withhold ALUNBRIG until adequate hyperglycemic control is achieved and resume at the next lower dose (Table 1) or permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. Other Grade 3 Withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to baseline, then resume at same dose. Recurrence: withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to baseline, then resume at next lower dose or discontinue ALUNBRIG (Table 1) . Grade 4 Withhold ALUNBRIG until recovery to baseline and resume at next lower dose (Table 1) . Recurrence: Permanently discontinue ALUNBRIG. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with ALUNBRIG [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If coadministration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the ALUNBRIG once daily dose by approximately 50% (i.e. from 180 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg). If coadministration of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the ALUNBRIG once daily dose by approximately 40% (i.e. from 180 mg to 120 mg, 120 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg). After discontinuation of a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor, resume the ALUNBRIG dose that was tolerated prior to initiating the CYP3A inhibitor. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Moderate CYP3A Inducers Avoid coadministration of moderate CYP3A inducers during treatment with ALUNBRIG [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If coadministration of a moderate CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided, increase the ALUNBRIG once daily dose in 30 mg increments after 7 days of treatment with the current ALUNBRIG dose as tolerated, up to a maximum of twice the ALUNBRIG dose that was tolerated prior to initiating the moderate CYP3A inducer. After discontinuation of a moderate CYP3A inducer, resume the ALUNBRIG dose that was tolerated prior to initiating the moderate CYP3A inducer. 2.6 Dosage Modifications for Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment Reduce the ALUNBRIG once daily dose by approximately 40% (i.e. from 180 mg to 120 mg, 120 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg) for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Patients with Severe Renal lmpairment Reduce the ALUNBRIG once daily dose by approximately 50% (i.e. from 180 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg) for patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15 to 29 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault] [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

Advanced ALK-positive NSCLC Without Prior ALK-targeted Therapy In ALTA 1L, the safety of ALUNBRIG was evaluated in 136 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who had not previously received an ALK-targeted therapy [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The median duration of treatment with ALUNBRIG when administered as 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days; then increased to 180 mg orally once daily, was 24.3 months. A total of 106 (78%) patients were exposed to ALUNBRIG for greater than or equal to 6 months including 92 (68%) patients exposed for greater than or equal to 1 year. The median relative dose intensity was 97% for ALUNBRIG. The study population (N = 275) characteristics were: median age 59 years (range: 27 to 89), age less than 65 years (68%), female (55%), White (59%), Asian (39%), Stage IV disease (93%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (96%), never smoker (58%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (95%), and CNS metastases at baseline (30%) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4.4%), ILD/pneumonitis (3.7%), pyrexia (2.9%), dyspnea (2.2%), pulmonary embolism (2.2%), and asthenia (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.9% of patients and included pneumonia (1.5%), cerebrovascular accident (0.7%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (0.7%). In ALTA 1L, 13% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG permanently discontinued ALUNBRIG for adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were ILD/pneumonitis (3.7%) and pneumonia (2.2%). In ALTA 1L, 38% of patients required a dose reduction due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reaction that led to dose reduction was increased creatine phosphokinase (15%), increased lipase (6.6%), increased amylase (4.4%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (2.2%), ILD/pneumonitis (2.2%) and hypertension (2.2%).

Patients received ALUNBRIG 90 mg once daily continuously (90 mg group) or 90 mg once daily for 7 days followed by 180 mg once daily (90â†’180 mg group). The median duration of treatment was 7.5 months in the 90 mg group and 7.8 months in the 90â†’180 mg group. A total of 150 (68%) patients were exposed to ALUNBRIG for greater than or equal to 6 months and 42 (19%) patients were exposed for greater than or equal to 1 year. The study population (N=222) characteristics were: median age 54 years (range: 18 to 82), age less than 65 years (77%), female (57%), White (67%), Asian (31%), Stage IV disease (98%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (97%), never or former smoker (95%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (93%), and CNS metastases at baseline (69%) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients in the 90 mg group and 40% of patients in the 90â†’180 mg group. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (5.5% overall, 3.7% in the 90 mg group, and 7.3% in the 90â†’180 mg group) and ILD/pneumonitis (4.6% overall, 1.8% in the 90 mg group and 7.3% in the 90â†’180 mg group). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.7% of patients and consisted of pneumonia (2 patients), sudden death, dyspnea, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, bacterial meningitis and urosepsis (1 patient each). In ALTA, 2.8% of patients in the 90 mg group and 8.2% of patients in the 90â†’180 mg group permanently discontinued ALUNBRIG for adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were ILD/pneumonitis (0.9% in the 90 mg group and 1.8% in the 90â†’180 mg group) and pneumonia (1.8% in the 90â†’180 mg group only). In ALTA, 14% of patients required a dose reduction due to adverse reactions (7.3% in the 90 mg group and 20% in the 90â†’180 mg group). The most common adverse reaction that led to dose reduction was increased creatine phosphokinase for both regimens (1.8% in the 90 mg group and 4.5% in the 90â†’180 mg group).

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Hepatic Impairment : Reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG for patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 2.6 , 8.6 ) Renal Impairment : Reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG for patients with severe renal impairment. ( 2.7 , 8.7 ) Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no clinical data on the use of ALUNBRIG in pregnant women. Administration of brigatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in dose-related skeletal anomalies at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily) as well as increased post-implantation loss, malformations, and decreased fetal body weight at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human exposure at 180 mg once daily) or greater (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in which pregnant rats were administered daily doses of brigatinib during organogenesis, dose-related skeletal (incomplete ossification, small incisors) and visceral anomalies were observed at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the human exposure by AUC at 180 mg once daily). Malformations observed at 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.26 times the human AUC at 180 mg once daily) included anasarca (generalized subcutaneous edema), anophthalmia (absent eyes), forelimb hyperflexion, small, short and/or bent limbs, multiple fused ribs, bent scapulae, omphalocele (intestine protruding into umbilicus), and gastroschisis (intestines protruding through a defect in the abdominal wall) along with visceral findings of moderate bilateral dilatation of the lateral ventricles. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the secretion of brigatinib in human milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for 1 week following the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ALUNBRIG [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception ALUNBRIG can cause fetal harm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 4 months after the final dose. Counsel patients to use a non-hormonal method of contraception since ALUNBRIG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ALUNBRIG and for at least 3 months after the final dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Based on findings in male reproductive organs in animals, ALUNBRIG may cause reduced fertility in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ALUNBRIG in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 359 patients enrolled in the ALTA 1L ALUNBRIG arm and in ALTA, 26.7% were 65 and older and 7.5% were 75 and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients â‰¥65 years and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) 30 to 89 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault]. Reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES TKI-naÃ¯ve Advanced ALK-positive NSCLC (ALTA 1L Study) The efficacy of ALUNBRIG was demonstrated in a randomized (1:1), open-label, multicenter trial (ALTA 1L, NCT02737501) in adult patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who had not previously received an ALK-targeted therapy. The study required patients to have an ALK rearrangement based on a local standard of care testing. Eligible patients were allowed to have up to 1 prior regimen of chemotherapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting and were required to have an ECOG Performance Status of 0-2. Neurologically stable patients with treated or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases, including leptomeningeal metastases, were eligible. Patients with a history of interstitial lung disease, drug-related pneumonitis, or radiation pneumonitis were excluded. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as evaluated by a Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Additional efficacy outcome measures as evaluated by the BIRC include confirmed overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), intracranial ORR, and intracranial DOR. A total of 275 patients were randomized to receive ALUNBRIG 180 mg orally once daily with a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily (n=137) or crizotinib 250 mg orally twice daily (n=138). Of the 275 enrolled patients, 239 had positive results using the companion diagnostic test, the Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit; central results were negative for 20 patients and unavailable for 16 patients. Randomization was stratified by CNS metastases (present vs absent) and prior chemotherapy use for locally advanced or metastatic disease (yes, no). Baseline demographic characteristics of the overall study population were: median age 59 years (range: 27 - 89, 32% 65 and over), 59% White and 39% Asian, 55% female, 39% ECOG PS 0 and 56% ECOG PS 1, and 58% never smokers. The disease characteristics of the overall study population were: 93% with Stage IV disease; 27% received chemotherapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting; 14% had received CNS radiation; 31% had bone metastases; and 20% had liver metastases. CNS metastases were present in 35% (n=96) of patients; 41 of those patients had measurable CNS lesions. ALTA 1L demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS by BIRC. Efficacy results from this study are described in Table 7 and Figure 1. At the data cutoff point overall survival data was not mature.

The study required patients to have a documented ALK rearrangement based on an FDA-approved test or a different test with adequate archival tissue to confirm ALK arrangement by the Vysis Â® ALK Break-Apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Probe Kit test. Key eligibility criteria included an ECOG Performance Status of 0-2 and progression on crizotinib. Neurologically stable patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases were permitted to enroll. Patients with a history of interstitial lung disease or drug-related pneumonitis or who had received crizotinib within 3 days of the first dose of brigatinib were excluded. The major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed overall response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) as evaluated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). Additional efficacy outcome measures included Investigator-assessed ORR, duration of response (DOR), intracranial ORR, and intracranial DOR. A total of 222 patients were randomized to receive ALUNBRIG either 90 mg once daily (90 mg arm; n=112) or 180 mg once daily following a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg once daily (90â†’180 mg arm; n=110). Randomization was stratified by CNS metastases (present vs absent) and best prior response to crizotinib (complete or partial response vs any other response/unevaluable). Baseline demographic characteristics of the overall study population were: median age 54 years (range 18 to 82, 23% 65 and over), 67% White and 31% Asian, 57% female, 36% ECOG PS 0 and 57% ECOG PS 1, and 95% never or former smokers. The disease characteristics of the overall study population were: Stage IV disease in 98%, adenocarcinoma histology in 97%, prior systemic chemotherapy in 74%, CNS metastases in 69% (61% had received prior CNS radiation), bone metastases in 39%, and liver metastases in 26% of patients. Sixty-four percent of patients had an objective response to prior crizotinib. The median duration of follow-up was 8 months (range: 0.1-20.2). Efficacy results from ALTA are summarized in Table 9.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Brigatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity at clinically achievable concentrations against multiple kinases including ALK, ROS1, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and FLT-3 as well as EGFR deletion and point mutations. Brigatinib inhibited autophosphorylation of ALK and ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT3, AKT, ERK1/2, and S6 in in vitro and in vivo assays. Brigatinib also inhibited the in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenograft growth in mice. At clinically achievable concentrations (â‰¤500 nM), brigatinib inhibited the in vitro viability of cells expressing EML4-ALK and 17 mutant forms associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors including crizotinib, as well as EGFR-Del (E746-A750), ROS1-L2026M, FLT3-F691L, and FLT3-D835Y. Brigatinib exhibited in vivo antitumor activity against 4 mutant forms of EML4-ALK, including G1202R and L1196M mutants identified in NSCLC tumors in patients who have progressed on crizotinib. Brigatinib also reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival in mice implanted intracranially with an ALK-driven tumor cell line. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Brigatinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of the pharmacodynamic response are unknown. Cardiac Electrophysiology The QT interval prolongation potential of ALUNBRIG was assessed in 123 patients following once daily ALUNBRIG doses of 30 mg (0.16 times the recommended dose of 180 mg) to 240 mg (1.3 times the recommended dose of 180 mg). ALUNBRIG did not prolong the QT interval to a clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The geometric mean (CV%) steady-state maximum concentration (C max ) of brigatinib at ALUNBRIG doses of 90 mg and 180 mg once daily was 552 (49%) ng/mL and 1452 (60%) ng/mL, respectively, and the corresponding area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-Tau ) was 8165 (45%) ngâˆ™h/mL and 20276 (62%) ngâˆ™h/mL. After a single dose and multiple dosing of ALUNBRIG, systemic exposure of brigatinib was dose proportional over the dose range of 60 mg (0.3 times the recommended dose of 180 mg) to 240 mg (1.3 times the recommended dose of 180 mg) once daily. The mean accumulation ratio after repeat dosing was 1.9 to 2.4. Absorption Following administration of single oral doses of ALUNBRIG of 30 mg to 240 mg, the median time to peak concentration (T max ) ranged from 1 to 4 hours. Effect of Food Brigatinib C max was reduced by 13% with no effect on AUC in healthy subjects administered ALUNBRIG after a high fat meal (approximately 920 calories, 58 grams carbohydrate, 59 grams fat and 40 grams protein) compared to the C max and AUC after overnight fasting. Distribution Brigatinib is 91% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is not concentration-dependent. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.69. Following oral administration of ALUNBRIG 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent volume of distribution (V z/ F) of brigatinib at steady-state was 307 L. Elimination Following oral administration of ALUNBRIG 180 mg once daily, the mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of brigatinib at steady-state is 8.9 L/h and the mean plasma elimination half-life is 25 hours. Metabolism Brigatinib is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in vitro . Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled brigatinib to healthy subjects, N-demethylation and cysteine conjugation were the two major metabolic pathways. Unchanged brigatinib (92%) was the major circulating radioactive component. Excretion Following oral administration of a single 180 mg dose of radiolabeled brigatinib to healthy subjects, 65% of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 25% of the administered dose was recovered in urine. Unchanged brigatinib represented 41% and 86% of the total radioactivity in feces and urine, respectively. Specific Populations Age, race, sex, body weight, and albumin concentration have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following a single dose of ALUNBRIG 90 mg, unbound brigatinib systemic exposure (AUC 0-INF ) was 37% higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. Unbound brigatinib systemic exposure (AUC 0-INF ) was similar between subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Following a single dose of ALUNBRIG 90 mg, unbound brigatinib systemic exposure (AUC 0-INF ) was 86% higher in subjects with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15 to 29 mL/min] compared to subjects with normal renal function. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, brigatinib exposures were similar among 125 subjects with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to 89 mL/min), 34 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min) and 270 subjects with normal renal function (CLcr â‰¥90 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors on Brigatinib: Coadministration of 200 mg twice daily doses of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) with a single 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG increased brigatinib C max by 21% and AUC 0-INF by 101%, relative to a 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . A moderate CYP3A inhibitor is predicted to increase the AUC of brigatinib by approximately 40%. Effect of Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors on Brigatinib: Coadministration of 600 mg twice daily doses of gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) with a single 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG decreased brigatinib C max by 41% and AUC 0-INF by 12%, relative to a 90 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone. The effect of gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of brigatinib is not clinically meaningful and the underlying mechanism for the decreased exposure of brigatinib is unknown. Effect of Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers on Brigatinib: Coadministration of 600 mg daily doses of rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer) with a single 180 mg dose of ALUNBRIG decreased brigatinib C max by 60% and AUC 0-INF by 80%, relative to a 180 mg dose of ALUNBRIG administered alone [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . A moderate CYP3A inducer is predicted to decrease the AUC of brigatinib by approximately 50%. In Vitro Studies Effect of Brigatinib on CYP Enzymes: Brigatinib, at clinically relevant plasma concentrations, induced CYP3A via activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR). Brigatinib may also induce CYP2C enzymes via the same mechanism at clinically relevant concentrations. Brigatinib did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations. Effect of P-glycoprotein and BCRP Inhibitors on Brigatinib: Brigatinib is a substrate of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Given that brigatinib exhibits high solubility and high permeability in vitro , P-gp and BCRP inhibitors are unlikely to increase plasma concentrations of brigatinib. Effect of Other Transporters on Brigatinib: Brigatinib is not a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1, OATP1B3), organic anion transporter (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation transporter (OCT1, OCT2), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE1, MATE2K), or bile salt export pump (BSEP). Effect of Brigatinib on Transporters: Brigatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OCT1, MATE1, and MATE2K in vitro . Therefore, brigatinib may have the potential to increase concentrations of coadministered substrates of these transporters. Brigatinib at clinically relevant concentrations did not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 or BSEP."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with brigatinib. Treatment with brigatinib resulted in chromosomal damage in an in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus in the rat, but was not mutagenic in the Ames or in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration tests. Dedicated animal fertility studies were not conducted with brigatinib. Testicular toxicity was observed in repeat-dose animal studies at doses resulting in exposure as low as 0.2 times the exposure in patients at the 180 mg dose. In rats, findings included lower weight of testes, seminal vesicles and prostate gland, and testicular tubular degeneration; these effects were not reversible during the 2 month recovery period. In monkeys, findings included reduced size of testes along with microscopic evidence of hypospermatogenesis; these effects were reversible during the recovery period."
