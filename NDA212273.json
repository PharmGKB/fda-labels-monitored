        "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE TRIKAFTA is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or a mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive based on in vitro data [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . If the patient's genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to confirm the presence of at least one F508del mutation or a mutation that is responsive based on in vitro data. TRIKAFTA is a combination of ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or a mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive based on in vitro data. If the patient's genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to confirm the presence of at least one F508del mutation or a mutation that is responsive based on in vitro data.

The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual time. the missed evening dose, the patient should not take the missed dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual time. Morning and evening doses should not be taken at the same time. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. See Table 2 . Liver function tests should be closely monitored [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Treatment is not recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Use of TRIKAFTA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit exceeds the risk. If used, TRIKAFTA should be used with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 2 ) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Liver function tests should be closely monitored [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. TRIKAFTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but the exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. TRIKAFTA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 2: Recommended Dosage for use of TRIKAFTA in patients with hepatic impairment Mild (Child-Pugh Class A) Moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) Severe (Child-Pugh Class C) No dose adjustment Use of TRIKAFTA should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit exceeds the risk. If used, TRIKAFTA should be used with caution at a reduced dose, as follows: Day 1: take two elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets in the morning Day 2: take one elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablet in the morning Continue alternating Day 1 and Day 2 dosing thereafter. No evening dose of ivacaftor tablet should be taken. Should not be used 2.4 Dosage Adjustment for Patients Taking Drugs that are CYP3A Inhibitors Table 3 describes the recommended dosage modification for TRIKAFTA when co-administered with strong (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, and clarithromycin) or moderate (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin) CYP3A inhibitors.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Elevated transaminases and hepatic injury: Liver failure leading to transplantation has been reported in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension while receiving TRIKAFTA. Avoid use of TRIKAFTA in patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease, (e.g., as evidenced by cirrhosis, portal hypertension, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment. Isolated elevations of transaminases or bilirubin have been observed in CF patients treated with TRIKAFTA. In some instances, transaminase elevations have been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin and/or international normalized ratio (INR) and have resulted in patients being hospitalized for intervention, including patients without a history of pre-existing liver disease. Monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin). Interrupt dosing in the event of significant elevations. In patients with a history of hepatobiliary disease or liver function test elevations, monitor more frequently. ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.7 ) Use with CYP3A inducers: Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) significantly decrease ivacaftor exposure and are expected to decrease elexacaftor and tezacaftor exposure, which may reduce TRIKAFTA efficacy. Therefore, co-administration is not recommended. ( 5.2 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Cataracts: Non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with ivacaftor-containing regimens. Baseline and follow-up examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating TRIKAFTA treatment. ( 5.4 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Elevated Transaminases and Hepatic Injury Liver failure leading to transplantation has been reported in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension while receiving TRIKAFTA. Avoid use of TRIKAFTA in patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease (e.g., as evidenced by cirrhosis, portal hypertension, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6) , Use in Specific Population (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Isolated elevations of transaminases or bilirubin have been observed in patients with CF treated with TRIKAFTA. In some instances, transaminase elevations have been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin and/or international normalized ratio (INR) and have resulted in patients being hospitalized for intervention, including in patients without a history of pre-existing liver disease. Assessments of liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) are recommended for all patients prior to initiating TRIKAFTA, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. In the event of significant elevations in liver function tests, e.g., ALT or AST >5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT or AST >3 × ULN with bilirubin >2 × ULN, dosing should be interrupted, and laboratory tests closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following the resolution of liver function test elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming treatment. For patients with a history of hepatobiliary disease or liver function test elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Adverse Reactions (6) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.2 Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inducers Exposure to ivacaftor is significantly decreased and exposure to elexacaftor and tezacaftor are expected to decrease by the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of TRIKAFTA. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.3 Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inhibitors Exposure to elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are increased when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Therefore, the dose of TRIKAFTA should be reduced when used concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.4 Cataracts Cases of non-congenital lens opacities have been reported in pediatric patients treated with ivacaftor-containing regimens. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use, exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment with ivacaftor cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating treatment with TRIKAFTA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Elevated Transaminases and Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse drug reactions to TRIKAFTA (≥5% of patients and at a frequency higher than placebo by ≥1%) were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, alanine aminotransferase increased, nasal congestion, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, rhinorrhea, rhinitis, influenza, sinusitis and blood bilirubin increased. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated at 1-877-634-8789 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety profile of TRIKAFTA is based on data from 510 CF patients aged 12 years and older in two double-blind, controlled trials of 24 weeks and 4 weeks treatment duration (Trials 1 and 2). Eligible patients were also able to participate in an open-label extension safety study (up to 96 weeks of TRIKAFTA). In the two controlled trials, a total of 257 patients aged 12 years and older received at least one dose of TRIKAFTA. In addition, the following clinical trials have also been conducted [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]: a 24-week open-label trial in 66 patients with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years who were either homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trial 3) In Trial 1, the proportion of patients who discontinued study drug prematurely due to adverse events was 1% for TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 0% for placebo-treated patients. In Trial 1, serious adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in TRIKAFTA-treated patients compared to placebo were rash (1% vs <1%) and influenza (1% vs 0). There were no deaths in Trials 1, 2 and 3. Table 4 shows adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of TRIKAFTA-treated patients and higher than placebo by ≥1% in the 24-week placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (Trial 1). Table 4: Adverse Drug Reactions in ≥5% of TRIKAFTA-Treated Patients and Higher than Placebo by ≥1% in Trial 1 Adverse Drug Reactions (Preferred Term) TRIKAFTA N=202 n (%) Placebo N=201 n (%) Headache 35 (17) 30 (15) Upper respiratory tract infection Includes upper respiratory tract infection and viral upper respiratory tract infection 32 (16) 25 (12) Abdominal pain Includes abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain lower 29 (14) 18 (9) Diarrhea 26 (13) 14 (7) Rash Includes: rash, rash generalized, rash erythematous, rash macular, rash pruritic 21 (10) 10 (5) Alanine aminotransferase increased 20 (10) 7 (3) Nasal congestion 19 (9) 15 (7) Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 19 (9) 9 (4) Aspartate aminotransferase increased 19 (9) 4 (2) Rhinorrhea 17 (8) 6 (3) Rhinitis 15 (7) 11 (5) Influenza 14 (7) 3 (1) Sinusitis 11 (5) 8 (4) Blood bilirubin increased 10 (5) 2 (1) Additional adverse reactions that occurred in TRIKAFTA-treated patients at a frequency of 2 to <5% and higher than placebo by ≥1% include the following: Flatulence, abdominal distension, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, urinary tract infection, c-reactive protein increased, hypoglycemia, dizziness, dysmenorrhea, acne, eczema and pruritus. The safety profile for the CF patients enrolled in Trial 2 and Trial 3 was similar to that observed in Trial 1. Rash Events In Trial 1, the overall incidence of rash events was 10% in TRIKAFTA-treated and 5% in placebo-treated patients (see Table 4 ). The incidence of rash events was higher in female TRIKAFTA-treated patients (16%) than in male TRIKAFTA-treated patients (5%). Hormonal contraceptives may play a role in the occurrence of rash. For patients taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, consider interrupting TRIKAFTA and hormonal contraceptives. Following the resolution of rash, consider resuming TRIKAFTA without the hormonal contraceptives. If rash does not recur, resumption of hormonal contraceptives can be considered. Laboratory and Vital Sign Abnormalities Liver Function Test Elevations In Trial 1, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, or >3 × ULN was 1%, 2%, and 8% in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 1%, 1%, and 5% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations (AST and/or ALT) was 11% in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 4% in placebo-treated patients. In Trial 1, the incidence of maximum total bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN was 4% in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and <1% in placebo-treated patients. Maximum indirect and direct bilirubin elevations >1.5 × ULN occurred in 11% and 3% of TRIKAFTA-treated patients, respectively. No TRIKAFTA-treated patients developed maximum direct bilirubin elevation >2 × ULN. During Trial 3, in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 × ULN were 0%, 1.5%, and 10.6%, respectively. No TRIKAFTA-treated patients had transaminase elevation >3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin >2 × ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations. Increased Creatine Phosphokinase In Trial 1, the incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase elevation >5 × ULN was 10% in TRIKAFTA-treated and 5% in placebo-treated patients. Among the TRIKAFTA-treated patients with creatine phosphokinase elevation >5 × ULN, 14% (3/21) required treatment interruption and none discontinued treatment. Increased Blood Pressure In Trial 1, the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively for TRIKAFTA-treated patients (baseline: 113 mmHg systolic and 69 mmHg diastolic) and 0.9 mmHg and 0.5 mmHg, respectively for placebo-treated patients (baseline: 114 mmHg systolic and 70 mmHg diastolic). The proportion of patients who had systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg and 10 mmHg increase from baseline on at least two occasions was 4% in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 1% in placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients who had diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg and 5 mmHg increase from baseline on at least two occasions was 1% in TRIKAFTA-treated patients and 2% in placebo-treated patients. With the exception of sex differences in rash, the safety profile of TRIKAFTA was generally similar across all subgroups of patients, including analysis by age, sex, baseline percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ) and geographic regions. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of TRIKAFTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Liver failure leading to transplantation in a patient with pre-existing cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Liver injury characterized by concomitant transaminase (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potential for other drugs to affect elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor Strong CYP3A inducers: Avoid co-administration. ( 5.2 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors: Reduce TRIKAFTA dosage when co-administered. Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit. ( 2.4 , 5.3 , 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Inducers of CYP3A Elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are substrates of CYP3A (ivacaftor is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A). Concomitant use of CYP3A inducers may result in reduced exposures and thus reduced TRIKAFTA efficacy. Co-administration of ivacaftor with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased ivacaftor area under the curve (AUC) by 89%. Elexacaftor and tezacaftor exposures are expected to decrease during co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers. Therefore, co-administration of TRIKAFTA with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Examples of strong CYP3A inducers include: rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) 7.2 Inhibitors of CYP3A Co-administration with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased elexacaftor AUC by 2.8-fold and tezacaftor AUC by 4.0 to 4.5-fold. When co-administered with itraconazole and ketoconazole, ivacaftor AUC increased by 15.6-fold and 8.5-fold, respectively. The dosage of TRIKAFTA should be reduced when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include: ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole telithromycin and clarithromycin Simulations indicated that co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors may increase elexacaftor and tezacaftor AUC by approximately 1.9 to 2.3-fold and 2.1-fold, respectively. Co-administration of fluconazole increased ivacaftor AUC by 2.9-fold. The dosage of TRIKAFTA should be reduced when co administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Examples of moderate CYP3A inhibitors include: fluconazole erythromycin Co-administration of TRIKAFTA with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor; therefore, food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with TRIKAFTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 7.3 Ciprofloxacin Ciprofloxacin had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of tezacaftor or ivacaftor and is not expected to affect the exposure of elexacaftor. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of TRIKAFTA with ciprofloxacin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Potential for elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor to affect other drugs 7.4 CYP2C9 Substrates Ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) during co administration of TRIKAFTA with warfarin is recommended. Other medicinal products for which exposure may be increased by TRIKAFTA include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.5 Transporters Co-administration of ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin AUC by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of TRIKAFTA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index such as cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus and tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Elexacaftor and M23-ELX inhibit uptake by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro . Co-administration of TRIKAFTA may increase exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters, such as statins, glyburide, nateglinide and repaglinide. When used concomitantly with substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Bilirubin is an OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate. 7.6 Hormonal Contraceptives TRIKAFTA has been studied with ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel and was found to have no clinically relevant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. TRIKAFTA is not expected to have an impact on the efficacy of oral contraceptives."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are limited and incomplete human data from clinical trials on the use of TRIKAFTA or its individual components, elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Although there are no animal reproduction studies with the concomitant administration of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, separate reproductive and developmental studies were conducted with each active component of TRIKAFTA in pregnant rats and rabbits. In animal embryo fetal development (EFD) studies oral administration of elexacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no teratogenicity or adverse developmental effects at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 2 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in rats and 4 times the MRHD in rabbits [based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite (for rat) and AUC of elexacaftor (for rabbit)]. Oral administration of tezacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no teratogenicity or adverse developmental effects at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 3 times the exposure at the MRHD in rats and 0.2 times the MRHD in rabbits (based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ). Oral administration of ivacaftor to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis demonstrated no teratogenicity or adverse developmental effects at doses that produced maternal exposures up to approximately 5 and 14 times the exposure at the MRHD, respectively [based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites (for rat) and AUC of ivacaftor (for rabbit)]. No adverse developmental effects were observed after oral administration of elexacaftor, tezacaftor or ivacaftor to pregnant rats from the period of organogenesis through lactation at doses that produced maternal exposures approximately 1 time, approximately 1 time and 3 times the exposures at the MRHD, respectively [based on summed AUCs of parent and metabolite(s)] ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Elexacaftor In an EFD study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6-17, elexacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal survival at exposures up to 9 times the MRHD (based on summed AUC for elexacaftor and its metabolite at maternal doses up to 40 mg/kg/day). Lower mean fetal body weights were observed at doses ≥25 mg/kg/day that produced maternal exposures ≥4 times the MRHD. In an EFD study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-20, elexacaftor was not teratogenic at exposures up to 4 times the MRHD (based on AUC of elexacaftor at maternal doses up to 125 mg/kg/day). In a pre- and postnatal development (PPND) study in pregnant rats dosed from gestation Day 6 through lactation Day 18, elexacaftor did not cause developmental defects in pups at maternal doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 time the MRHD based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite). Placental transfer of elexacaftor was observed in pregnant rats. Tezacaftor In an EFD study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6-17 and in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-20, tezacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to 3 and 0.2 times, respectively the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ). Lower fetal body weights were observed in rabbits at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures approximately 1 time the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ at a maternal dose of 50 mg/kg/day). In a PPND study in pregnant rats dosed from gestation Day 6 through lactation Day 18, tezacaftor had no adverse developmental effects on pups at an exposure of approximately 1 time the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1-TEZ at a maternal dose of 25 mg/kg/day). Decreased fetal body weights and early developmental delays in pinna detachment, eye opening and righting reflex occurred at a maternally toxic dose (based on maternal weight loss) that produced exposures approximately 1 time the exposure at the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for tezacaftor and M1-TEZ at a maternal oral dose of 50 mg/kg/day). Placental transfer of tezacaftor was observed in pregnant rats. Ivacaftor In an EFD study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-17 and in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7-19, ivacaftor was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal survival at exposures up to 5 and 14 times, respectively, the MRHD [based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites (for rat) and AUC of ivacaftor (for rabbit)]. In a PPND study in pregnant rats dosed from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, ivacaftor had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at exposures up to 3 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs for ivacaftor and its metabolites at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day). Decreased fetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose that produced exposures 5 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Placental transfer of ivacaftor was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, or ivacaftor in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor are excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see Data ) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TRIKAFTA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from TRIKAFTA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Elexacaftor Lacteal excretion of elexacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (10 mg/kg) of 14 C-elexacaftor administered 6 to 10 days postpartum to lactating dams. Exposure of 14 C-elexacaftor in milk was approximately 0.4 times the value observed in plasma (based on AUC 0-72h ). Tezacaftor Lacteal excretion of tezacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (30 mg/kg) of 14 C-tezacaftor administered 6 to 10 days postpartum to lactating dams. Exposure of 14 C-tezacaftor in milk was approximately 3 times higher than in plasma (based on AUC 0-72h ). Ivacaftor Lacteal excretion of ivacaftor in rats was demonstrated following a single oral dose (100 mg/kg) of 14 C-ivacaftor administered 9 to 10 days postpartum to lactating dams. Exposure of 14 C-ivacaftor in milk was approximately 1.5 times higher than in plasma (based on AUC 0-24h ). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TRIKAFTA for the treatment of CF in patients aged 6 to less than 18 years who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or a mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive based on in vitro data has been established. Use of TRIKAFTA for this indication was supported by evidence from two adequate and well-controlled studies in CF patients aged 12 years and older (Trial 1 and Trial 2) and one open-label study in CF patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (Trial 3) . In these trials, a total of 138 patients (aged 6 to less than 18 years) received TRIKAFTA, including: In Trial 1, 56 adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who had an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . In Trial 2, 16 adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who were homozygous for the F508del mutation [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . In Trial 3, 66 children aged 6 to less than 12 years who were homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation with a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The effectiveness of TRIKAFTA in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years was extrapolated from patients aged 12 years and older with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor exposure levels in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years within the range of exposures observed in patients aged 12 years and older [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Safety of TRIKAFTA in this population was derived from a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 66 patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.3 years) administered either a total dose of elexacaftor 100 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg in the morning and ivacaftor 75 mg in the evening (for patients weighing less than 30 kgs) or a total dose of elexacaftor 200 mg/tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg in the morning and ivacaftor 150 mg in the evening (for patients weighing 30 kgs or more) (Trial 3). The safety profile of patients in this trial was similar to that observed in Trial 1 [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. The safety and effectiveness of TRIKAFTA in patients with CF younger than 6 years of age have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal Day 7 through 35 with ivacaftor dose levels of 10 mg/kg/day and higher (0.21 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites). This finding has not been observed in older animals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Studies were conducted with tezacaftor in juvenile rats starting at postnatal day (PND) 21 and ranging up to PNDs 35 to 49. Findings of convulsions and death were observed in juvenile rats that received a tezacaftor dose level of 100 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to 1.9 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ). A no effect dose level was identified at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to 0.8 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ). Findings were dose related and generally more severe when dosing with tezacaftor was initiated earlier in the postnatal period (PND 7, which would be approximately equivalent to a human neonate). Tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ, are substrates for P-glycoprotein. Lower brain levels of P-glycoprotein activity in younger rats resulted in higher brain levels of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ. These findings are not relevant for the indicated pediatric population 6 to 11 years of age, for whom levels of P-glycoprotein activity are equivalent to levels observed in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of TRIKAFTA did not include any patients aged 65 years and older. 8.6 Renal Impairment TRIKAFTA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or moderate (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment. Use with caution in patients with severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose modification is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Treatment is not recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). In a clinical study of 11 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, one subject developed total and direct bilirubin elevations >2 × ULN, and a second subject developed direct bilirubin elevation >4.5 × ULN. Use of TRIKAFTA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit exceeds the risk. If used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, TRIKAFTA should be used with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 2 ). Liver function tests should be closely monitored in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. TRIKAFTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but the exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. TRIKAFTA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.8 Patients with Severe Lung Dysfunction Trial 1 included a total of 18 patients receiving TRIKAFTA with ppFEV 1 <40 at baseline. The safety and efficacy in this subgroup were comparable to those observed in the overall population."

The effectiveness of TRIKAFTA in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years was extrapolated from patients aged 12 years and older with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor exposure levels in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years within the range of exposures observed in patients aged 12 years and older [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Safety of TRIKAFTA in this population was derived from a 24-week, open-label, clinical trial in 66 patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.3 years) administered either a total dose of elexacaftor 100 mg/tezacaftor 50 mg/ivacaftor 75 mg in the morning and ivacaftor 75 mg in the evening (for patients weighing less than 30 kgs) or a total dose of elexacaftor 200 mg/tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg in the morning and ivacaftor 150 mg in the evening (for patients weighing 30 kgs or more) (Trial 3). The safety profile of patients in this trial was similar to that observed in Trial 1 [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. The safety and effectiveness of TRIKAFTA in patients with CF younger than 6 years of age have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal Day 7 through 35 with ivacaftor dose levels of 10 mg/kg/day and higher (0.21 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of ivacaftor and its metabolites). This finding has not been observed in older animals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Studies were conducted with tezacaftor in juvenile rats starting at postnatal day (PND) 21 and ranging up to PNDs 35 to 49. Findings of convulsions and death were observed in juvenile rats that received a tezacaftor dose level of 100 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to 1.9 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ). A no effect dose level was identified at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to 0.8 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ). Findings were dose related and generally more severe when dosing with tezacaftor was initiated earlier in the postnatal period (PND 7, which would be approximately equivalent to a human neonate). Tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ, are substrates for P-glycoprotein. Lower brain levels of P-glycoprotein activity in younger rats resulted in higher brain levels of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ. These findings are not relevant for the indicated pediatric population 6 to 11 years of age, for whom levels of P-glycoprotein activity are equivalent to levels observed in adults."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Elexacaftor and tezacaftor bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of select mutant forms of CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. Ivacaftor potentiates the channel open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR mediated chloride transport. CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing CFTR mutations that result in CFTR protein being delivered to the cell surface. The in vitro CFTR chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical benefit. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response. Table 5 lists responsive CFTR mutations based on in vitro data in FRT cells indicating that elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor increases chloride transport to at least 10% of normal over baseline.

In Trial 2 (patients homozygous for the F508del mutation), a reduction in sweat chloride was observed from baseline at Week 4 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In Trial 3 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 24 was -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2). Cardiac Electrophysiology At doses up to 2 times the maximum recommended dose of elexacaftor and 3 times the maximum recommended dose of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects was not prolonged to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult subjects and patients with CF. The pharmacokinetic parameters for elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 12 years and older are shown in Table 6.

Following oral administration of TRIKAFTA to patients 12 to less than 18 years of age (elexacaftor 200 mg qd/tezacaftor 100 mg qd/ivacaftor 150 mg q12h), the mean (±SD) AUC ss was 147 (36.8) mcg∙h/mL, 88.8 (21.8) mcg∙h/mL and 10.6 (3.35) mcg∙h/mL, respectively for elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, similar to the AUC ss in adult patients. Patients with Renal Impairment Renal excretion of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor is minimal. Elexacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor has not been studied in subjects with severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Based on population PK analyses, the clearance of elexacaftor and tezacaftor was similar in subjects with mild (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or moderate (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment relative to patients with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Elexacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15). In a clinical study, following multiple doses of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had 25% higher AUC and 12% higher C max for elexacaftor, 73% higher AUC and 70% higher C max for M23-ELX, 36% higher AUC and 24% higher C max for combined elexacaftor and M23-ELX, 20% higher AUC but similar C max for tezacaftor and 1.5-fold higher AUC and 10% higher C max for ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Tezacaftor and ivacaftor Following multiple doses of tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had an approximately 36% higher AUC and a 10% higher in C max for tezacaftor and a 1.5-fold higher AUC but similar C max for ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Ivacaftor In a study with ivacaftor alone, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had similar ivacaftor C max , but an approximately 2.0-fold higher ivacaftor AUC 0-∞ compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Male and Female Patients Based on population PK analysis, the exposures of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar in males and females. Drug Interactions Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Potential for Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor and/or Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and tezacaftor have a low potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, whereas ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A. However, clinical studies showed that the combination regimen of tezacaftor/ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of CYP3A and ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8 or CYP2D6. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are not likely to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and tezacaftor have a low potential to inhibit the transporter P-gp, while ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit P-gp. Co-administration of tezacaftor/ivacaftor with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold in a clinical study. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and M23-ELX may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 uptake. Tezacaftor has a low potential to inhibit BCRP, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of the transporters OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. The effects of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor on the exposure of co-administered drugs are shown in Table 8 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Exposure to elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor may be reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that elexacaftor and tezacaftor are substrates for the efflux transporter P-gp, but ivacaftor is not. Elexacaftor and ivacaftor are not substrates for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3; tezacaftor is a substrate for OATP1B1, but not OATP1B3. Tezacaftor is a substrate for BCRP. The effects of co-administered drugs on the exposure of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor are shown in Table 9 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .

        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Elexacaftor and tezacaftor bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of select mutant forms of CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. Ivacaftor potentiates the channel open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR mediated chloride transport. CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing CFTR mutations that result in CFTR protein being delivered to the cell surface. The in vitro CFTR chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical benefit. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response. Table 5 lists responsive CFTR mutations based on in vitro data in FRT cells indicating that elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor increases chloride transport to at least 10% of normal over baseline.

        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar between healthy adult subjects and patients with CF. The pharmacokinetic parameters for elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 12 years and older are shown in Table 6.

Following oral administration of TRIKAFTA to patients 12 to less than 18 years of age (elexacaftor 200 mg qd/tezacaftor 100 mg qd/ivacaftor 150 mg q12h), the mean (±SD) AUC ss was 147 (36.8) mcg∙h/mL, 88.8 (21.8) mcg∙h/mL and 10.6 (3.35) mcg∙h/mL, respectively for elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, similar to the AUC ss in adult patients. Patients with Renal Impairment Renal excretion of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor is minimal. Elexacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor has not been studied in subjects with severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Based on population PK analyses, the clearance of elexacaftor and tezacaftor was similar in subjects with mild (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or moderate (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment relative to patients with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment Elexacaftor alone or in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15). In a clinical study, following multiple doses of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) had 25% higher AUC and 12% higher C max for elexacaftor, 73% higher AUC and 70% higher C max for M23-ELX, 36% higher AUC and 24% higher C max for combined elexacaftor and M23-ELX, 20% higher AUC but similar C max for tezacaftor and 1.5-fold higher AUC and 10% higher C max for ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Tezacaftor and ivacaftor Following multiple doses of tezacaftor and ivacaftor for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had an approximately 36% higher AUC and a 10% higher in C max for tezacaftor and a 1.5-fold higher AUC but similar C max for ivacaftor compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Ivacaftor In a study with ivacaftor alone, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had similar ivacaftor C max , but an approximately 2.0-fold higher ivacaftor AUC 0-∞ compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. Male and Female Patients Based on population PK analysis, the exposures of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are similar in males and females. Drug Interactions Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor and other drugs likely to be co-administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interaction studies [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Potential for Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor and/or Ivacaftor to Affect Other Drugs Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and tezacaftor have a low potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, whereas ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A. However, clinical studies showed that the combination regimen of tezacaftor/ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of CYP3A and ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8 or CYP2D6. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor are not likely to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and tezacaftor have a low potential to inhibit the transporter P-gp, while ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit P-gp. Co-administration of tezacaftor/ivacaftor with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold in a clinical study. Based on in vitro results, elexacaftor and M23-ELX may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 uptake. Tezacaftor has a low potential to inhibit BCRP, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. Ivacaftor is not an inhibitor of the transporters OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. The effects of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor on the exposure of co-administered drugs are shown in Table 8 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Exposure to elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor may be reduced by concomitant CYP3A inducers and increased by concomitant CYP3A inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that elexacaftor and tezacaftor are substrates for the efflux transporter P-gp, but ivacaftor is not. Elexacaftor and ivacaftor are not substrates for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3; tezacaftor is a substrate for OATP1B1, but not OATP1B3. Tezacaftor is a substrate for BCRP. The effects of co-administered drugs on the exposure of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor are shown in Table 9 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] .

Elexacaftor A 6-month study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at 50 mg/kg/day dose, the highest dose tested. Elexacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus assay in TK6 cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Elexacaftor did not cause reproductive system toxicity in male rats at 55 mg/kg/day and female rats at 25 mg/kg/day, equivalent to approximately 6 times and 4 times the MRHD, respectively (based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite). Elexacaftor did not cause embryonic toxicity at 35 mg/kg/day which was the highest dose tested, equivalent to approximately 7 times the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite). Lower male and female fertility, male copulation and female conception indices were observed in males at 75 mg/kg/day and females at 35 mg/kg/day, equivalent to approximately 6 times and 7 times, respectively, the MRHD (based on summed AUCs of elexacaftor and its metabolite). Tezacaftor A 2-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats and a 6-month study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice were conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of tezacaftor. No evidence of tumorigenicity from tezacaftor was observed in male and female rats at oral doses up to 50 and 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 and 2 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of tezacaftor and its metabolites in males and females, respectively). No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in male and female Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice at tezacaftor doses up to 500 mg/kg/day. Tezacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. There were no effects on male or female fertility and early embryonic development in rats at oral tezacaftor doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the MRHD based on summed AUC of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ). Ivacaftor Two-year studies were conducted in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats to assess the carcinogenic potential of ivacaftor. No evidence of tumorigenicity from ivacaftor was observed in mice or rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately equivalent to 2 and 7 times the MRHD, respectively, based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Ivacaftor was negative for genotoxicity in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in vivo mouse micronucleus test. Ivacaftor impaired fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 and 5 times, respectively, the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites). Increases in prolonged diestrus were observed in females at 200 mg/kg/day. Ivacaftor also increased the number of females with all nonviable embryos and decreased corpora lutea, implantations and viable embryos in rats at 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ivacaftor and its metabolites) when dams were dosed prior to and during early pregnancy. These impairments of fertility and reproductive performance in male and female rats at 200 mg/kg/day were attributed to severe toxicity."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Efficacy : The efficacy of TRIKAFTA in patients with CF aged 12 years and older was evaluated in two double blind, controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2). Trial 1 was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients who had an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ivacaftor. An interim analysis was planned when at least 140 patients completed Week 4 and at least 100 patients completed Week 12. Trial 2 was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study in patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. Patients received tezacaftor 100 mg qd/ivacaftor 150 mg q12h during a 4-week open-label run-in period and were then randomized and dosed to receive TRIKAFTA or tezacaftor 100 mg qd/ivacaftor 150 mg q12h during a 4-week double-blind treatment period. Patients in Trials 1 and 2 had a confirmed diagnosis of CF and at least one F508del mutation. Patients discontinued any previous CFTR modulator therapies, but continued on their other standard-of-care CF therapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa and hypertonic saline). Patients had a ppFEV 1 at screening between 40-90%. Patients with a history of colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status, including but not limited to Burkholderia cenocepacia , Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus , or who had an abnormal liver function test at screening (ALT, AST, ALP, or GGT ≥3 × ULN, or total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN), were excluded from the trials. Patients in Trials 1 and 2 were eligible to roll over into a 96-week open-label extension study. 14.1 Trial 1 Trial 1 evaluated 403 patients (200 TRIKAFTA, 203 placebo) with CF aged 12 years and older (mean age 26.2 years). The mean ppFEV 1 at baseline was 61.4% (range: 32.3%, 97.1%). The primary endpoint assessed at the time of interim analysis was mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4. The final analysis tested all key secondary endpoints in the 403 patients who completed the 24-week study participation, including absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24; absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at Week 4 and through Week 24; number of pulmonary exacerbations through Week 24; absolute change in BMI from baseline at Week 24, and absolute change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score (a measure of respiratory symptoms relevant to patients with CF, such as cough, sputum production and difficulty breathing) from baseline at Week 4 and through Week 24. Of the 403 patients included in the interim analysis, the treatment difference between TRIKAFTA and placebo for the mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Week 4 was 13.8 percentage points (95% CI: 12.1, 15.4; P <0.0001). The treatment difference between TRIKAFTA and placebo for mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24 was 14.3 percentage points (95% CI: 12.7, 15.8; P <0.0001). Mean improvement in ppFEV 1 was observed at the first assessment on Day 15 and sustained through the 24-week treatment period (see Figure 1 ). Improvements in ppFEV 1 were observed regardless of age, baseline ppFEV 1 , sex and geographic region. See Table 10 for a summary of primary and key secondary outcomes in Trial 1.

The mean ppFEV 1 at baseline, following the 4-week open-label run-in period with tezacaftor/ivacaftor was 60.9% (range: 35.0%, 89.0%). The primary endpoint was mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4 of the double-blind treatment period. The key secondary efficacy endpoints were absolute change in sweat chloride and CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score from baseline at Week 4. Treatment with TRIKAFTA compared to tezacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV 1 of 10.0 percentage points (95% CI: 7.4, 12.6; P <0.0001). Mean improvement in ppFEV 1 was observed at the first assessment on Day 15. Improvements in ppFEV 1 were observed regardless of age, sex, baseline ppFEV 1 and geographic region.

        "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Elevated Transaminases and Hepatic Injury Inform the patients that liver failure leading to transplantation has been reported in a patient with cirrhosis with portal hypertension while receiving TRIKAFTA. Avoid use of TRIKAFTA in patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, portal hypertension, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) , Use in Specific Population (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Inform patients that isolated elevation of transaminases or bilirubin have occurred in patients treated with TRIKAFTA. In some instances, transaminase elevations have been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin and/or INR and have resulted in patients being hospitalized for intervention, including in patients without a history of pre-existing liver disease. Liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) should be assessed prior to initiating TRIKAFTA, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. More frequent monitoring should be considered in patients with a history of hepatobiliary disease or liver function test elevations [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) , Use in Specific Population (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drug Interactions with CYP3A Inducers and Inhibitors Ask patients to tell you all the medications they are taking including any herbal supplements or vitamins. Co-administration of TRIKAFTA with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) is not recommended, as they may reduce the efficacy of TRIKAFTA. Dose reduction to two elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets twice a week, taken approximately 3 to 4 days apart is recommended when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. Advise the patient not to take the evening dose of ivacaftor. Dose reduction to two elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets and one ivacaftor tablet taken on alternate days is recommended when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole. Advise the patient not to take the evening dose of ivacaftor. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, score 5-6). See Table 2 . Liver function tests should be closely monitored. Treatment is not recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9). Use of TRIKAFTA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit exceeds the risk. If used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, TRIKAFTA should be used with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 2 ). Liver function tests should be closely monitored. TRIKAFTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15), but the exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. TRIKAFTA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Inquire and/or assess whether patients have liver impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Cataracts Inform patients that abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) has been noted in some children and adolescents receiving ivacaftor-containing regimens. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations should be performed in pediatric patients initiating treatment with TRIKAFTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Administration Inform patients that TRIKAFTA is best absorbed by the body when taken with food that contains fat. A typical CF diet will satisfy this requirement. Examples include eggs, butter, peanut butter, whole-milk dairy products (such as whole milk, cheese and yogurt), etc. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients should be informed about what to do in the event they miss a dose of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets or ivacaftor tablet: If 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose with fat-containing food as soon as possible. If more than 6 hours have passed since: the time the morning dose is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the morning dose as soon as possible, and not take the evening dose. Patients should take the next scheduled morning dose at the usual time. the time the evening dose is usually taken, patients should be instructed to not take the missed evening dose. Patients should take the next scheduled morning dose at the usual time. Patients should be instructed to not take the morning and evening doses at the same time. Patients should be advised to contact their health care provider if they have questions."
