        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : RYDAPT may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise of the potential risk to a fetus. ( 5.1 , 8.1 ) Pulmonary Toxicity : Monitor for symptoms of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Discontinue RYDAPT in patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Fatal cases have occurred. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal reproduction studies, RYDAPT may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal studies, midostaurin caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including late embryo-fetal death and reduced fetal birth weight, with delays in fetal growth at doses lower than the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating RYDAPT therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RYDAPT and for 4 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RYDAPT and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . 5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity Cases of interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis, some fatal, have occurred in patients treated with RYDAPT as monotherapy or with chemotherapy. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms. Discontinue RYDAPT in patients who experience signs or symptoms of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis without an infectious etiology. 5.3 Risk of Prolonged Severe Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia in Pediatric Patients Treated With Combination Chemotherapy Prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in two pediatric patients with AML who received an unapproved formulation of midostaurin in combination with chemotherapy, including anthracyclines, fludarabine, and cytarabine; these two patients were coadministered an azole antifungal (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), which may increase midostaurin concentrations and subsequently, the risk of toxicity [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . The safety and effectiveness of RYDAPT in pediatric patients have not been established."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Pulmonary Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] AML : The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were febrile neutropenia, nausea, mucositis, vomiting, headache, petechiae, musculoskeletal pain, epistaxis, device-related infection, hyperglycemia, electrocardiogram (ECG) QT prolonged, and upper respiratory tract infection. ( 6.1 ) ASM, SM-AHN, or MCL : The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, edema, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, constipation, pyrexia, headache, and dyspnea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 and/or at https://report.novartis.com/ or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Acute Myeloid Leukemia The safety evaluation of RYDAPT (50 mg twice daily with food) in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated AML is based on a randomized, double-blind, trial of RYDAPT (n = 345) or placebo (n = 335) with chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . The overall median duration of exposure was 42 days (range, 2 to 576 days) for patients in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm versus 34 days (range, 1 to 465 days) for patients in the placebo plus chemotherapy arm. On the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm, 35% of patients completed induction and consolidation therapy, compared to 25% of patients on the placebo plus chemotherapy arm. The most frequent (incidence greater than or equal to 20%) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm were febrile neutropenia, nausea, mucositis, vomiting, headache, petechiae, musculoskeletal pain, epistaxis, device-related infection, hyperglycemia, ECG QT prolonged, and upper respiratory tract infections. The most frequent Grade 3/4 adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 10%) were febrile neutropenia, device-related infection, and mucositis. The most frequent serious adverse reaction (≥ 10%) in patients in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm was febrile neutropenia (16%), which occurred at a similar rate in the placebo arm (16%). Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 9% of patients in the RYDAPT arm versus 6% in the placebo arm. The most frequent (> 1%) Grade 3/4 adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the RYDAPT arm was renal insufficiency (1%). Excluding deaths due to disease progression, no fatal adverse reactions occurred in the study. Overall, the most frequent non-treatment related cause of death in the RYDAPT plus chemotherapy arm was sepsis (2%) and occurred at a similar rate in the placebo arm (2%). Table 2 presents the frequency category of adverse reactions reported in the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated AML. Adverse reactions are listed according to body system. Within each body system, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Table 3 presents the key laboratory abnormalities from the same randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 mutated AML.

Common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 5% difference between the RYDAPT and placebo arms) reported for these patients included nausea (47% vs 18%), hyperglycemia (20% vs 13%) and vomiting (19% vs 5%). Systemic Mastocytosis Two single-arm, open-label multicenter trials (Study 2 and Study 3) evaluated the safety of RYDAPT (100 mg twice daily with food) as a single agent in 142 adult patients total with ASM, SM-AHN, or MCL. The median age was 63 (range, 24 to 82), 63% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and 75% had no hepatic impairment (bilirubin and AST ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN)] at baseline. The median duration of exposure to RYDAPT was 11.4 months (range, 0 to 81 months), with 34% treated for ≥ 24 months. The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 20%), excluding laboratory terms, were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, edema, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, constipation, pyrexia, headache, and dyspnea (Table 4). Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions reported in ≥ 5%, excluding laboratory terms, were fatigue, sepsis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pneumonia, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, edema, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and renal insufficiency (Table 4). Adverse reactions led to dose modifications (interruption or reduction) in 56% of patients. Among these, the most frequent adverse reactions (> 5%) were gastrointestinal symptoms, QT prolongation, neutropenia, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, lipase increase, and fatigue. The median time to first dose modification for toxicity was 1.6 months, with 75% of dose modifications first occurring within 5 months of starting treatment. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions causing treatment discontinuation included infection, nausea or vomiting, QT prolongation, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 68% of patients, most commonly (≥ 20%) due to infections and gastrointestinal disorders. On-treatment deaths unrelated to the underlying malignancy occurred in 16 patients (11%), most commonly from infection (sepsis or pneumonia), followed by cardiac events. Of the on-treatment deaths from disease progression, 4 were also attributable to infection. Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in ≥ 10% of the patients with advanced SM.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase exposure to midostaurin and its active metabolites. Consider alternative therapies that do not strongly inhibit CYP3A4 or monitor for increased risk of adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : Avoid concomitant use as strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease exposure to midostaurin and its active metabolites. ( 7.1 ) CYP2B6, BCRP, OATP1B1 Substrates : Dose adjustments for coadministered CYP2B6, BCRP, and OATP1B1 substrates may be necessary with RYDAPT. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on RYDAPT Table 6 lists the potential effects of the coadministration of strong CYP3A modulators on RYDAPT. Table 6: Drug Interactions with RYDAPT That Affect Midostaurin Strong CYP3A Inhibitors a The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration-, dose-, and preparation-dependent. Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor” when a certain preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double strength) or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor” when another preparation was used (e.g., low dose, single strength). b The induction potency of St. John’s wort may vary widely based on preparation. Clinical Impact Coadministration of RYDAPT with strong CYP3A inhibitors may increase midostaurin concentrations. The increase in midostaurin concentrations may be pronounced if strong CYP3A inhibitors are administered during the first week of RYDAPT administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increased midostaurin concentrations may increase the risk of toxicity. Prevention or Management Consider alternative therapies that do not strongly inhibit CYP3A activity. Alternatively, with coadministration of RYDAPT and strong CYP3A inhibitors, monitor patients for increased risk of adverse reactions, especially during the first week of consecutive RYDAPT administration in advanced SM population, and during first week of RYDAPT administration in each cycle of chemotherapy in AML population. Examples Boceprevir, clarithromycin, cobicistat, conivaptan, danoprevir and ritonavir, diltiazem, elvitegravir and ritonavir, grapefruit juice a , idelalisib, indinavir and ritonavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir and ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, paritaprevir and ritonavir and (ombitasvir and/or dasabuvir), posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir and ritonavir, tipranavir and ritonavir, troleandomycin, voriconazole Strong CYP3A Inducers Clinical Impact Coadministration of RYDAPT with strong CYP3A inducers may decrease midostaurin concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Decreased midostaurin concentrations may reduce efficacy. Prevention or Management Avoid coadministration of RYDAPT with strong CYP3A4 inducers. Examples Carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort b 7.2 Effect of RYDAPT on Other Drugs CYP2B6 Substrates RYDAPT decreased the systemic exposure of a sensitive CYP2B6 substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Dose adjustments for the coadministered CYP2B6 substrate may be necessary with RYDAPT. Substrates of Transporters Coadministration of RYDAPT increased the exposure of a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP)1B1 substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Dose adjustments for the coadministered BCRP or OATP1B1 substrates may be necessary with RYDAPT."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise females not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to RYDAPT during pregnancy. Females who may have been exposed to RYDAPT during pregnancy directly or through a male partner receiving RYDAPT therapy should contact the Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 and/or at https://report.novartis.com/ . Risk Summary Based on mechanism of action and findings in animal reproduction studies, RYDAPT may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . There are no available data on RYDAPT use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of midostaurin to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including late embryo-fetal death and reduced fetal birth weight, with delays in fetal growth at doses lower than the recommended human dose (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data When midostaurin was administered to female rats prior to mating and through the first week of pregnancy at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day [approximately 0.1 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on area under the curve (AUC)], there were increases in pre- and post-implantation loss, including total litter loss, resulting in a reduction in the number of live embryos. During organogenesis, midostaurin administered at oral doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.004 times the human exposure at the recommended dose by AUC) to pregnant female rats caused late embryo-fetal death. Dilated lateral brain ventricles were observed in offspring of rats given doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day. Extra rib and reduced fetal birth weight with effects on fetal growth (severe renal pelvic cavitation and widened anterior fontanelle) were observed in the absence of maternal toxicity at the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.05 times the human exposure at the recommended dose by AUC). Midostaurin administered orally to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis led to maternal toxicity with spontaneous abortions and some delay in fetal growth (reduced fetal birth weight) at doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.01 times the human exposure at the recommended dose by AUC). In an oral pre- and postnatal development study in the rat, adverse effects upon maternal performance included dams with signs of dystocia and a lower live litter size at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.05 times the human exposure at the recommended dose by AUC). For the F1 offspring, lower body weights, accelerated complete eye opening and delayed auricular startle ontogeny were noted at 30 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of midostaurin or its active metabolites in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. Orally administered midostaurin and its active metabolites pass into the milk of lactating rats within 1 hour of a 30 mg/kg/day dose, with approximately 5 times more in the milk of lactating rats compared to plasma. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from RYDAPT, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with RYDAPT and for 4 months after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential RYDAPT may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within seven days prior to initiating RYDAPT. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RYDAPT and for 4 months after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during RYDAPT treatment and for 4 months after stopping treatment with RYDAPT [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . Infertility Based on findings in animals, RYDAPT may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of RYDAPT have not been established in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of an unapproved midostaurin formulation was investigated, but not established in two open-label studies: a study in 22 pediatric patients aged 6 months to 17 years who received midostaurin as a single agent for relapsed or refractory leukemia [NCT00866281] and a study in 4 patients aged 8 to 14 years who received midostaurin in combination with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML [NCT03591510]. Prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 2 of the 4 pediatric patients with AML who received midostaurin in combination with chemotherapy, including anthracyclines, fludarabine, and cytarabine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasted for 44 days in one patient and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and Grade 4 neutropenia lasted for 51 days and 46 days, respectively, in the other patient. These two patients were coadministered an azole antifungal (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), which may increase midostaurin concentrations and subsequently, the risk of toxicity [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 142 patients with advanced SM in clinical studies of RYDAPT, 64 (45%) were aged 65 and over, and 16 (11%) were aged 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or response rate were observed between the subjects aged 65 and over compared with younger subjects. Greater sensitivity of older individuals cannot be ruled out. Clinical studies in AML with RYDAPT did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, administration for elderly patients should be cautious, based on patient’s eligibility for concomitant chemotherapy and reflecting the greater frequency of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Midostaurin is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases. In vitro biochemical or cellular assays have shown that midostaurin or its major human active metabolites CGP62221 and CGP52421 inhibit the activity of wild type FLT3, FLT3 mutant kinases (ITD and TKD), KIT (wild type and D816V mutant), PDGFRα/β, as well as members of the serine/threonine kinase PKC (protein kinase C) family. Midostaurin demonstrated the ability to inhibit FLT3 receptor signaling and cell proliferation, and it induced apoptosis in leukemic cells expressing ITD and TKD mutant FLT3 receptors or overexpressing wild type FLT3 and PDGF receptors. Midostaurin also demonstrated the ability to inhibit KIT signaling, cell proliferation and histamine release and induce apoptosis in mast cells. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of RYDAPT (75 mg twice daily for 3 days) on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and moxifloxacin controlled, multiple-dose, blinded, parallel study. There was no clinically significant prolongation of QTc interval or relationship between changes in QTc and concentrations for midostaurin and its active metabolites (CGP62221 and CGP52421). The study duration was not long enough to estimate the effects of the metabolite CGP52421 on the QT/QTc interval. In pooled clinical studies in patients with advanced SM, 4.7% patients had a post-baseline QTcF > 480 ms, no patients had a QTcF > 500 ms, and 6.3% patients had a QTcF > 60 ms compared to baseline. In a randomized placebo-controlled study in patients with AML, the proportion of patients with QTc prolongation was higher in patients randomized to midostaurin as compared to placebo (QTcF > 480 ms: 10.1% vs 5.7%; QTcF > 500 ms: 6.2% vs 2.6%; QTcF > 60 ms change from baseline: 18.4% vs 10.7%). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Midostaurin exhibits time-dependent pharmacokinetics with an initial increase in minimum concentrations (C min ) that reach the highest C min concentrations during the first week followed by a decline to a steady-state after approximately 28 days. The pharmacokinetics of the CGP62221 showed a similar trend. The plasma concentrations of CGP52421 continued to increase after one month of treatment. The highest C min and steady-state of midostaurin, CGP62221, and CGP52421 were similar when RYDAPT was administered with food at a dose of 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg twice daily. Absorption The time to maximal concentrations (T max ) occurred between 1 to 3 hours post dose in the fasted state. Effect of Food Midostaurin exposure, represented by AUC over time to infinity (AUC inf ), increased 1.2-fold when RYDAPT was coadministered with a standard meal (457 calories, 50 g fat, 21 g proteins, and 18 g carbohydrates) and 1.6-fold when coadministered with a high-fat meal (1007 calories, 66 g fat, 32 g proteins, and 64 g carbohydrates) compared to when RYDAPT was administered in a fasted state. Midostaurin maximum concentrations (C max ) were reduced by 20% with a standard meal and by 27% with a high-fat meal compared to a fasted state. T max was delayed when RYDAPT was administered with a standard meal or a high-fat meal (median T max = 2.5 hrs to 3 hrs) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Distribution Midostaurin has an estimated geometric mean volume of distribution (% coefficient of variation) of 95.2 L (31%). Midostaurin and its metabolites are distributed mainly in plasma in vitro . Midostaurin, CGP62221, and CGP52421 are greater than 99.8% bound to plasma protein in vitro .

Elimination The geometric mean terminal half-life (% coefficient of variation) is 19 hours (39%) for midostaurin, 32 hours (31%) for CGP62221 and 482 hours (25%) for CGP52421. Metabolism Midostaurin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. CGP62221 and CGP52421 (mean ± standard deviation) account for 28 ± 2.7% and 38 ± 6.6% respectively of the total circulating radioactivity.

The pharmacokinetics of midostaurin in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin greater than 3.0 times the ULN and any value for AST) or severe renal impairment (CLCr 15 to 29 mL/min) is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Midostaurin Coadministration of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) with a single dose of RYDAPT (50 mg) increased AUC inf of midostaurin by 10.4-fold and CGP62221 by 3.5-fold and area under the curve over time to last measurable concentrations (AUC 0-t ) of CGP52421 by 1.2-fold compared to a single RYDAPT dose coadministered with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Coadministration of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) with multiple doses of RYDAPT (100 mg twice daily on Days 1 to 2 and 50 mg twice daily on Days 3 to 28) increased Day 28 C min concentrations of midostaurin by 2.1-fold, CGP62221 by 1.2-fold, and CGP52421 by 1.3-fold compared to the respective Day 21 C min concentrations with RYDAPT alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Midostaurin Coadministration of rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) with a single dose of RYDAPT (50 mg) decreased AUC inf of midostaurin by 96% and CGP62221 by 92% and AUC 0-t of CGP52421 by 59% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Effect of Midostaurin on CYP2B6 Substrates Coadministration of multiple doses of RYDAPT (50 mg twice daily) at steady-state with a single dose of bupropion (a sensitive CYP2B6 substrate) decreased the AUC inf of bupropion by 48% and hydroxybupropion by 65% [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Effect of Midostaurin on CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 Substrates Coadministration of multiple doses of RYDAPT (50 mg twice daily) at steady-state with single doses of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) or pioglitazone (a moderate sensitive CYP2C8 substrate) did not affect AUC inf of midazolam or pioglitazone. However, the effect of multiple doses of RYDAPT on sensitive substrates of CYP3A and CYP2C8 during the first week, when midostaurin trough concentrations are highest, is unknown. Coadministration of a single dose of RYDAPT (100 mg) with a single dose of dextromethorphan (a sensitive CYP2D6 substrate) did not affect the AUC inf of dextromethorphan. The effect of multiple doses of RYDAPT on dextromethorphan is unknown. Coadministration of multiple doses of RYDAPT (50 mg twice daily) at steady-state with a single dose of a hormonal contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel (CYP3A4 substrates) increased the area under the curve over time to the last measurable concentration (AUC last ) of ethinyl estradiol by 10% and levonorgestrel by 42%. However, the effect of multiple doses of RYDAPT on ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel during the first week, when midostaurin trough concentrations are highest, is unknown.

        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Midostaurin is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases. In vitro biochemical or cellular assays have shown that midostaurin or its major human active metabolites CGP62221 and CGP52421 inhibit the activity of wild type FLT3, FLT3 mutant kinases (ITD and TKD), KIT (wild type and D816V mutant), PDGFRα/β, as well as members of the serine/threonine kinase PKC (protein kinase C) family. Midostaurin demonstrated the ability to inhibit FLT3 receptor signaling and cell proliferation, and it induced apoptosis in leukemic cells expressing ITD and TKD mutant FLT3 receptors or overexpressing wild type FLT3 and PDGF receptors. Midostaurin also demonstrated the ability to inhibit KIT signaling, cell proliferation and histamine release and induce apoptosis in mast cells."

        "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of RYDAPT (75 mg twice daily for 3 days) on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and moxifloxacin controlled, multiple-dose, blinded, parallel study. There was no clinically significant prolongation of QTc interval or relationship between changes in QTc and concentrations for midostaurin and its active metabolites (CGP62221 and CGP52421). The study duration was not long enough to estimate the effects of the metabolite CGP52421 on the QT/QTc interval. In pooled clinical studies in patients with advanced SM, 4.7% patients had a post-baseline QTcF > 480 ms, no patients had a QTcF > 500 ms, and 6.3% patients had a QTcF > 60 ms compared to baseline. In a randomized placebo-controlled study in patients with AML, the proportion of patients with QTc prolongation was higher in patients randomized to midostaurin as compared to placebo (QTcF > 480 ms: 10.1% vs 5.7%; QTcF > 500 ms: 6.2% vs 2.6%; QTcF > 60 ms change from baseline: 18.4% vs 10.7%)."

        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Midostaurin exhibits time-dependent pharmacokinetics with an initial increase in minimum concentrations (C min ) that reach the highest C min concentrations during the first week followed by a decline to a steady-state after approximately 28 days. The pharmacokinetics of the CGP62221 showed a similar trend. The plasma concentrations of CGP52421 continued to increase after one month of treatment. The highest C min and steady-state of midostaurin, CGP62221, and CGP52421 were similar when RYDAPT was administered with food at a dose of 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg twice daily. Absorption The time to maximal concentrations (T max ) occurred between 1 to 3 hours post dose in the fasted state. Effect of Food Midostaurin exposure, represented by AUC over time to infinity (AUC inf ), increased 1.2-fold when RYDAPT was coadministered with a standard meal (457 calories, 50 g fat, 21 g proteins, and 18 g carbohydrates) and 1.6-fold when coadministered with a high-fat meal (1007 calories, 66 g fat, 32 g proteins, and 64 g carbohydrates) compared to when RYDAPT was administered in a fasted state. Midostaurin maximum concentrations (C max ) were reduced by 20% with a standard meal and by 27% with a high-fat meal compared to a fasted state. T max was delayed when RYDAPT was administered with a standard meal or a high-fat meal (median T max = 2.5 hrs to 3 hrs) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Study 1 RYDAPT in combination with chemotherapy was investigated in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 717 patients with newly-diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. In this study, FLT3 mutation status was determined prospectively with a clinical trial assay and verified retrospectively using the companion diagnostic LeukoStrat ® CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is an FDA-approved test for selection of patients with AML for RYDAPT treatment. Patients were stratified by FLT3 mutation status: TKD, ITD with allelic ratio less than 0.7, and ITD with allelic ratio greater than or equal to 0.7. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia or therapy-related AML were not eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive RYDAPT 50 mg twice daily (n = 360) or placebo (n = 357) with food on Days 8 to 21 in combination with daunorubicin (60 mg/m 2 daily on Days 1 to 3) /cytarabine (200 mg/m 2 daily on Days 1 to 7) for up to two cycles of induction and high dose cytarabine (3 g/m 2 every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5) for up to four cycles of consolidation, followed by continuous RYDAPT or placebo treatment according to initial assignment for up to 12 additional 28-day cycles. There was no re-randomization at the start of post consolidation therapy. Patients who proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) stopped receiving study treatment. The randomized patients had a median age of 47 years (range, 18 to 60 years), 44% were male, and 88% had a performance status of 0-1. AML was de novo onset in 95%. The percentage of patients with FLT3-ITD allelic ratio < 0.7, FLT3-ITD allelic ratio ≥ 0.7, and FLT3-TKD mutations were identical (per randomized FLT3 stratum) on both arms (48%, 30%, and 23%, respectively). Of the 563 patients with NPM1 testing, 58% had an NPM1 mutation. The two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to the baseline demographics and disease characteristics, except that the placebo arm had a higher percentage of females (59%) than in the midostaurin arm (52%). NPM1 mutations were identified in 55% of patients tested on the midostaurin arm and 60% of patients tested on the placebo arm. A second course of induction was administered to 25% of the patients, 62% initiated at least one cycle of consolidation, 29% initiated maintenance, and 17% completed all 12 planned cycles of maintenance; 21% of the patients underwent SCT in first CR. The overall rate of SCT (induction failure, first CR or salvage after relapse) was 59% (214/360) of patients in the RYDAPT plus standard chemotherapy arm versus 55% (197/357) in the placebo plus standard chemotherapy arm. All patients were followed for survival. Efficacy was established on the basis of overall survival (OS), measured from the date of randomization until death by any cause. The primary analysis was conducted after a minimum follow-up of approximately 3.5 years after the randomization of the last patient. RYDAPT plus standard chemotherapy was superior to placebo plus standard chemotherapy in OS [HR 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63, 0.95; 2 sided p = 0.016] (Figure 1). Because survival curves plateaued before reaching the median, median survival could not be reliably estimated. Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Overall Survival in Study 1 The analysis of event-free survival (EFS), defined as a failure to obtain a complete remission (CR) within 60 days of initiation of protocol therapy, or relapse, or death from any cause, showed a statistically significant improvement with a median of 8.2 months for RYDAPT plus standard chemotherapy versus 3.0 months for placebo plus standard chemotherapy with HR 0.78 (95% CI 0.66, 0.93) and 2 sided p = 0.005. In an exploratory analysis of EFS defined as a failure to obtain a CR any time during induction, or relapse, or death from any cause with failures assigned as an event on study Day 1, the median EFS was 10.6 months for RYDAPT plus standard chemotherapy versus 5.6 months for placebo plus standard chemotherapy with HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.61, 0.86).

The study enrolled 116 adult patients with relapse or progression to 0, 1, or 2 prior regimens for SM. The study excluded patients with serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL, hepatic transaminases > 2.5 x ULN or > 5 x ULN if disease-related, total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN or > 3 x ULN if disease-related, QTc > 450 msec, cardiovascular disease, including left-ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, or any pulmonary infiltrates. In addition, the study excluded patients with acute-stage or life-threatening AHN. Patients received RYDAPT 100 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Of the 116 patients treated, a study steering committee identified 89 patients who had measurable C-findings and were evaluable for response. The median age in this group was 64 years (range, 25 to 82), 64% of patients were male, and nearly all patients (97%) were Caucasian. Among these patients, 36% had prior therapy for SM, and 82% had the KIT D816V mutation detected at baseline. Their median duration of treatment was 11 months (range, < 1 to 68 months), with treatment ongoing in 17%. Efficacy was established on the basis of confirmed complete remission (CR) plus incomplete remission (ICR) by 6 cycles of RYDAPT by modified Valent criteria for ASM and SM-AHN (Table 7). Table 7 shows responses to RYDAPT according to modified Valent criteria. Confirmed major or partial responses occurred in 46 of 73 patients with a documented KIT D816V mutation, 7 of 16 with wild-type or unknown status with respect to KIT D816V mutation, and 21 of 32 having prior therapy for SM.
