(2.1) Dosage can be increased by 5 mg daily every 3 to 4 days. (2.1) The maximum single dose is 20 mg. (2.1) Dosage is not to exceed a maximum of 80 mg daily. (2.1) The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg is 5 mg to 15 mg daily, in divided doses. (2.1) Dosage can be increased by 2.5 mg daily every 3 to 4 days. (2.1) The maximum single dose is 10 mg. (2.1) Dosage is not to exceed a maximum of 40 mg daily. (2.1) The recommended starting dosage for adult and pediatric patients with renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and in known N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) poor metabolizers is the lowest recommended initial daily dosage ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ) For patients with a dosage adjustment of less than 5 mg increments, or who have difficulty swallowing, or require feeding tube, a l mg/mL suspension can be prepared. (2.5) 2.1 Dosage Information The recommended dosage regimen of FIRDAPSE for adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is included in Table 1. For pediatric patients, the recommended dosing regimen is dependent on body weight. Dosage should be increased every 3 to 4 days based on clinical response and tolerability. Titration increments should not exceed those shown in Table 1. Table 1: Recommended Oral Dosage for the Treatment of LEMS in Adults and Pediatric Patients 6 Years of Age and Older *See Dosage and Administration (2.5) for a method to achieve these doses Age and Body Weight Initial Daily Dosage* Titration Regimen Maximum Single Dose Maximum Total Daily Maintenance Dosage Adults (any weight) Pediatric patients weighing 45 kg or more 15 mg to 30 mg daily, in 3 to 4 divided doses Increase total daily dosage by 5 mg every 3 or 4 days 20 mg 80 mg Given in divided doses Pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg 5 mg to 15 mg daily, in 3 to 4 divided doses Increase total daily dosage by 2.5 mg every 3 or 4 days 10 mg 40 mg Given in divided doses Missed Dose If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses. 2.2 Patients with Renal Impairment The recommended starting dosage of FIRDAPSE in patients with renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15 to 90 mL/min] is the lowest recommended initial daily dosage (i.e., 15 mg daily for pediatric patients weighing 45 kg or more and for adults, and 5 mg daily for pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg) taken orally in divided doses. No dosage recommendation for FIRDAPSE can be made for patients with end-stage renal disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended starting dosage of FIRDAPSE in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment is the lowest recommended initial daily dosage (i.e., 15 mg daily for pediatric patients weighing 45 kg or more and for adults, and 5 mg daily for pediatric patients weighting less than 45 kg) taken orally in divided doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Known N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) Poor Metabolizers The recommended starting dosage of FIRDAPSE in known N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) poor metabolizers is the lowest recommended initial daily dosage (i.e., 15 mg daily for pediatric patients weighing 45 kg or more and for adults, and 5 mg daily for pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg) taken orally in divided doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.8) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. 2.5 Administration Instructions FIRDAPSE can be taken without regard to food. Preparation of a 1mg/mL Suspension (see the Instructions for Use for full instructions on how to prepare the 1mg/mL suspension) When patients require a dosage in less than 5 mg increments, have difficulty swallowing tablets, or require feeding tubes, a 1 mg/mL suspension can be prepared (e.g., by placing the required number of tablets in a 50 to 100 mL container, adding 10 mL of sterile water for each tablet, waiting for 5 minutes, and shaking well for 30 seconds). Crushing the tablets prior to making the suspension is not necessary. After preparation of the suspension, an oral syringe can be used to draw up and administer the correct dose by mouth or by feeding tube. Storage of 1mg/mL Prepared Suspension Refrigerate the suspension between doses and shake well before drawing up each dose. The suspension can be stored under refrigeration [between 2°C and 8°C (36°F and 46°F)] for up to 24 hours. Discard any unused portion of the suspension after 24 hours."

( 5.1 ) Hypersensitivity reactions: If a hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis occurs, FIRDAPSE should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Seizures FIRDAPSE can cause seizures. Seizures have been observed in patients without a history of seizures taking FIRDAPSE at the recommended doses, at various times after initiation of treatment, at an incidence of approximately 2%. Many of the patients were taking medications or had comorbid medical conditions that may have lowered the seizure threshold [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Seizures may be dose-dependent. Consider discontinuation or dose-reduction of FIRDAPSE in patients who have a seizure while on treatment. FIRDAPSE is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures. 5.2 Hypersensitivity In clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis associated with FIRDAPSE administration have not been reported. Anaphylaxis has been reported in patients taking another aminopyridine; therefore, it may occur with FIRDAPSE. If anaphylaxis occurs, administration of FIRDAPSE should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated."

In controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials (Study 1 and 2) in patients with LEMS [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , 63 patients were treated with FIRDAPSE, including 40 patients treated for more than 6 months, and 39 patients treated for more than 12 months. In an expanded access program, 139 patients with LEMS were treated with FIRDAPSE, including 102 patients treated for more than 6 months, 77 patients treated for more than 12 months, and 53 patients treated for more than 18 months. Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized discontinuation study in adults with LEMS. Following an initial open- label run-in phase (up to 90 days), patients were randomized to either continue FIRDAPSE treatment or transition to placebo, for a 14- day double-blind phase. Following final assessments, patients were allowed to resume FIRDAPSE treatment for up to 2 years (open- label long-term safety phase of the study). During the open-label run-in phase of Study 1, 53 patients received FIRDAPSE for an average of 81 days at a mean daily dosage of 50.5 mg/day. The mean patient age was 52.1 years and 66% were female. There were 42 patients who had no prior exposure to FIRDAPSE at the initiation of this study. Table 2 shows adverse reactions with an incidence of 5% or greater occurring in the 42 LEMS patients newly initiated on treatment with FIRDAPSE during the run-in phase of the study. Table 2.

These patients received a mean daily dosage of 66 mg of FIRDAPSE. Pediatrics Safety of FIRDAPSE was evaluated in pediatric patients in an expanded access program, where 21 pediatric patients received FIRDAPSE for at least 1 year. Adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients were similar to those seen in adult patients, with the exception of clinically significant weight loss in two pediatric patients at doses of 60 mg per day and higher."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to FIRDAPSE during pregnancy. Physicians are encouraged to enroll pregnant patients, or pregnant women may register themselves in the registry by calling 855-212-5856 (toll-free), using the Fax number 877-867-1874 (toll-free), by contacting the Pregnancy Coordinating Center at firdapsepregnancyregistry@ubc.com , or by visiting the study website www.firdapsepregnancystudy.com . Risk Summary There are no data on the developmental risk associated with the use of FIRDAPSE in pregnant women. In animal studies, administration of amifampridine phosphate to rats during pregnancy and lactation resulted in developmental toxicity (increase in stillbirths and pup deaths, reduced pup weight, and delayed sexual development) at doses associated with maternal plasma drug levels lower than therapeutic drug levels (see Animal Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Data Animal Data Oral administration of amifampridine phosphate (0, 7.5, 22.5, or 75 mg/kg/day) to female rats prior to and during mating and continuing throughout organogenesis produced no adverse effects on embryofetal development. Plasma amifampridine exposure (AUC) at the highest dose tested is approximately 7 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg amifampridine/day. Oral administration of amifampridine phosphate (0, 9, 30, or 57 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis produced no adverse effects on embryofetal development. The highest dose tested is approximately 7 times the MRHD (80 mg/day amifampridine) on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. Oral administration of amifampridine phosphate (0, 7.5, 22.5, or 75 mg/kg/day) to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in an increase in stillbirths and pup deaths, reduced pup weight, and delayed sexual development in female pups at the mid and high doses tested. The no-effect dose (7.5 mg/kg/day amifampridine phosphate) for adverse developmental effects is associated with a plasma amifampridine exposure (AUC) less than that in humans at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of FIRDAPSE in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for FIRDAPSE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from FIRDAPSE or from the underlying maternal condition. In lactating rat, amifampridine was excreted in milk and reached levels similar to those in maternal plasma. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of FIRDAPSE for the treatment of LEMS have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. Use of FIRDAPSE for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of FIRDAPSE in adults with LEMS, pharmacokinetic data in adult patients, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation to identify the dosing regimen in pediatric patients, and safety data from pediatric patients aged 6 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of FIRDAPSE did not include a sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over (19 of 63 patients in Studies 1 and 2) to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.2 , 7.3)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal clearance is an elimination pathway for amifampridine and the inactive metabolite, 3-N-acetyl amifampridine, and exposure of amifampridine is higher in subjects with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, in patients with renal impairment, FIRDAPSE should be initiated at the lowest recommended initial daily dosage, and patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Consider dosage modification or discontinuation of FIRDAPSE for patients with renal impairment as needed based on clinical effect and tolerability. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of amifampridine have not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr <15 mL/min or patients requiring dialysis). No dosage recommendation for FIRDAPSE can be made for patients with end-stage renal disease. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with any degree of hepatic impairment, FIRDAPSE should be initiated at the lowest recommended initial daily dosage, and patients should be monitored for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Consider dosage modification or discontinuation of FIRDAPSE for patients with hepatic impairment as needed based on clinical effect and tolerability. 8.8 NAT2 Poor Metabolizers Exposure of FIRDAPSE is increased in patients who are N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) poor metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Therefore, initiate FIRDAPSE in patients who are known NAT2 poor metabolizers at the lowest recommended initial daily dosage and monitor for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Consider dosage modification of FIRDAPSE for patients who are known NAT2 poor metabolizers as needed based on clinical effect and tolerability."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which amifampridine exerts its therapeutic effect in LEMS patients has not been fully elucidated. Amifampridine is a broad-spectrum potassium channel blocker. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of FIRDAPSE on QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double blind, randomized, placebo and positive controlled study in 52 healthy individuals who are slow acetylators. At an exposure 2-fold the expected maximum therapeutic exposure of amifampridine, FIRDAPSE did not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of amifampridine are similar between healthy individuals and LEMS patients. Following single and multiple doses, AUC, C max and C min were highly variable between individuals. FIRDAPSE exposure increased proportionally with dose across the range of 20 mg to 80 mg single oral doses. Absorption Amifampridine peak plasma concentration is reached 20 minutes to 1 hour after administration. Food does not have a clinically significant effect on the exposure of amifampridine. Elimination Amifampridine is eliminated primarily through metabolism to 3-N-acetyl-amifampridine and to a smaller extent through the kidneys. The terminal half-life ranges from 1.8 to 2.5 hours in healthy subjects. Metabolism Amifampridine is extensively metabolized by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) to 3-N-acetyl-amifampridine, which is considered an inactive metabolite. Excretion Following administration of FIRDAPSE to healthy subjects, 93% to 100% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine as amifampridine or 3-N-acetyl amifampridine over 24 hours. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients (6 Years of Age and Older) A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that body weight significantly correlates with the clearance of amifampridine; clearance increased with an increase in body weight. A weight-based dosing regimen is necessary to achieve amifampridine exposures in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, similar to the exposures observed in adults at recommended doses of FIRDAPSE [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic data are available from a study of 24 otherwise healthy subjects with impaired renal function who received a single 10-mg dose of FIRDAPSE. The exposure of amifampridine (measured as AUC) was 2- to 3-fold higher in subjects with moderate (CLcr 30-59 mL/min) or severe (CLcr 15-29 mL/min) renal impairment than in subjects with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 90 mL/min) . Compared with subjects with normal renal function, subjects with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60-89 mL/min) had a 36% increase in exposure. Therefore, FIRDAPSE should be initiated at the lowest recommended initial daily dosage in patients with renal impairment, and such patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . C max was marginally affected by renal impairment. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study was conducted to determine the PK, safety, and tolerability of FIRDAPSE (amifampridine phosphate) administered at 10 mg to subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (N = 7) compared to demographically matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function (N = 9). The subjects with moderate hepatic impairment had a 22% higher C max and a 33% higher AUC inf for amifampridine than subjects with normal hepatic function. FIRDAPSE was not evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Genetic variants in the N-acetyltransferase gene 2 (NAT2) affect the rate and extent of FIRDAPSE metabolism. Poor metabolizers, also referred to as \"slow acetylators\" (i.e., carriers of two reduced function alleles), have 3.5- to 4.5-fold higher C max , and 5.6- to 9- fold higher AUC than normal metabolizers, also referred to as \"fast/rapid acetylators\" (i.e., carriers of two normal function alleles). Therefore, FIRDAPSE should be initiated at the lowest recommended initial daily dosage in known NAT2 poor metabolizers, and such patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8) ] . In the general population, the NAT2 poor metabolizer phenotype prevalence is 40–60% in the White and African American populations, and in 10–30% in Asian ethnic populations (individuals of Japanese, Chinese, or Korean descent)."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of FIRDAPSE for the treatment of LEMS was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation studies. A total of 64 adults (age 21 to 88 years) with LEMS were enrolled (Study 1 and Study 2). The studies enrolled patients with a confirmed diagnosis of LEMS based on either neurophysiology studies or a positive anti-P/Q type voltage-gated calcium channel antibody test. Patients were required to be on an adequate and stable dosage (30 to 80 mg daily) of amifampridine phosphate prior to entering the randomized discontinuation phases of both studies. The two co-primary measures of efficacy in both studies were the change from baseline to the end of the discontinuation period in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score and in the Subject Global Impression (SGI) score. The QMG is a 13-item physician-rated categorical scale assessing muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4 -point scale, where a score of 0 represents no weakness, and a score of 3 represents severe weakness (total score 0-39). Higher scores represent greater impairment. The SGI is a 7-point scale on which patients rated their global impression of the effects of the study treatment on their physical well- being. Lower scores on the SGI represent lower perceived benefit with the study treatment. A key secondary efficacy endpoint was the clinical global impression improvement (CGI-I) score, a 7-point scale on which the treating physician rated the global impression of change in clinical symptoms. A higher CGI-I score indicates a perceived worsening of clinical symptoms. Study 1 ( NCT01377922 ) After an initial open-label run-in phase, 38 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to either continue treatment with FIRDAPSE (n=16) or to a downward titration to placebo (n=22) over 7 days. Following the downward titration period, patients remained on blinded FIRDAPSE or placebo for 7 more days. Efficacy was assessed at Day 14 of the double-blind period. Patients were allowed to use stable dosages of peripherally acting cholinesterase inhibitors or oral immunosuppressants. Twenty-six percent of patients randomized to FIRDAPSE were receiving cholinesterase inhibitors, versus 36% in the placebo group, and 28% of patients randomized to FIRDAPSE were receiving oral immunosuppressant therapies, versus 34% in the placebo group. Patients had a median age of 54 years (range: 21 to 88 years), 61% were female, and 90% were White. Eighty-four percent of patients had a diagnosis of autoimmune LEMS, and 16% of patients had a diagnosis of paraneoplastic LEMS. During the double-blind period (from Baseline to Day 14), the QMG scores tended to worsen in both treatment groups, but there was significantly greater worsening in the placebo group than in the FIRDAPSE group ( p =0.045). Similarly, the SGI score tended to worsen in both treatment groups during the double-blind period, but there was significantly greater worsening in the placebo group than in the FIRDAPSE group ( p =0.003), as summarized in Table 3. These results indicate that in Study 1, patients randomized to placebo had a significantly greater worsening of muscle weakness and of global impression of the effects of the study treatment on their physical well-being, compared to patients who continued FIRDAPSE in the double-blind period. Table 3. Change from Baseline to Day 14 in QMG Score and SGI Score in Study 1 a. QMG Score range 0 (no impairment) to 39 (worst impairment) b.

Study 2 ( NCT02970162 ) Patients on stable treatment with FIRDAPSE were randomized 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to either continue treatment with FIRDAPSE (n=13) or change to placebo (n=13) for 4 days. Efficacy was assessed at the end of the 4-day double-blind discontinuation period. Patients were allowed to use stable doses of peripherally acting cholinesterase inhibitors or corticosteroids. Sixty-one percent of patients randomized to FIRDAPSE were receiving cholinesterase inhibitors, versus 54% of patients randomized to placebo. Corticosteroid use was similar between FIRDAPSE and placebo (8%). Patients with recent use of immunomodulatory therapies (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate, cyclosporine), rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin G, and plasmapheresis were excluded from the study. Patients had a median age of 55.5 years (range: 31 to 75 years), 62% were female, and 88% were white. From Baseline to Day 4, there was significantly greater worsening in the QMG score in the placebo group than in the FIRDAPSE group ( p =0.0004), and also significantly greater worsening in the SGI score in the placebo group than in the FIRDAPSE group( p =0.0003), as summarized in Table 4. These results indicate that in Study 2, patients randomized to placebo had a significantly greater worsening of muscle weakness and of global impression of the effects of the study treatment on their physical well-being, compared to patients who continued FIRDAPSE in the double-blind period.
