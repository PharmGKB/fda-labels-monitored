Interrupt and evaluate patients with new or worsening respiratory symptoms suspected to be due to ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue KISQALI in patients with recurrent symptomatic or severe ILD/pneumonitis. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs): Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug-reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) can occur with KISQALI treatment. Permanently discontinue KISQALI in patients with SCARs or other life-threatening cutaneous reactions. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) QT Interval Prolongation: Monitor electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes prior to initiation of treatment with KISQALI. Repeat ECGs at approximately Day 14 of the first cycle and at the beginning of the second cycle, and as clinically indicated. Monitor electrolytes at the beginning of each cycle for 6 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Avoid using KISQALI with drugs known to prolong QT interval and/or strong CYP3A inhibitors. ( 2.2 , 5.3 , 7.1 , 7.4 ) Increased QT Prolongation with Concomitant Use of Tamoxifen: KISQALI is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen. ( 5.4 ) Hepatobiliary Toxicity: Increases in serum transaminase levels have been observed. Perform liver function tests (LFTs) before initiating treatment with KISQALI. Monitor LFTs every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated. ( 2.2 , 5.5 ) Neutropenia: Perform complete blood count (CBC) before initiating therapy with KISQALI. Monitor CBC every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated. ( 2.2 , 5.6 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during therapy. ( 5.7 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with KISQALI and other CDK4/6 inhibitors. Across clinical trials (MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-3, MONALEESA-7), 1.6% of KISQALI-treated patients had ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.4% had Grade 3 or 4, and 0.1% had a fatal outcome. Additional cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis which may include hypoxia, cough, and dyspnea. In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms suspected to be due to ILD or pneumonitis, interrupt KISQALI immediately and evaluate the patient. Permanently discontinue KISQALI in patients with recurrent symptomatic or severe ILD/pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DiHS)/drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) can occur in patients treated with KISQALI [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous reactions occur, interrupt KISQALI until the etiology of the reaction has been determined [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Early consultation with a dermatologist is recommended to ensure greater diagnostic accuracy and appropriate management. If SJS, TEN, or DiHS/DRESS is confirmed, permanently discontinue KISQALI. Do not reintroduce KISQALI in patients who have experienced SCARs or other life-threatening cutaneous reactions during KISQALI treatment. 5.3 QT Interval Prolongation KISQALI has been shown to prolong the QT interval in a concentration-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Based on the observed QT prolongation during treatment, KISQALI may require dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in Table 4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7.4)] . Across MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-7, and MONALEESA-3 in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received the combination of KISQALI plus an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant, 15 out of 1054 patients (1.4%) had a > 500 ms post-baseline QTcF value, and 61 out of 1054 patients (6%) had a > 60 ms increase from baseline in QTcF intervals. These ECG changes were reversible with dose interruption and the majority occurred within the first four weeks of treatment. There were no reported cases of Torsades de Pointes. In MONALEESA-2, on the KISQALI plus letrozole treatment arm, there was one (0.3%) sudden death in a patient with Grade 3 hypokalemia and Grade 2 QT prolongation. No cases of sudden death were reported in MONALEESA-7 or MONALEESA-3 [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Assess ECG prior to initiation of treatment. Initiate treatment with KISQALI only in patients with QTcF values less than 450 ms. Repeat ECG at approximately Day 14 of the first cycle and the beginning of the second cycle, and as clinically indicated. Monitor serum electrolytes (including potassium, calcium, phosphorous and magnesium) prior to the initiation of treatment, at the beginning of the first 6 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Correct any abnormality before starting KISQALI therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Avoid the use of KISQALI in patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QT prolongation, including patients with: long QT syndrome uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, and bradyarrhythmias electrolyte abnormalities Avoid using KISQALI with drugs known to prolong QT interval and/or strong CYP3A inhibitors as this may lead to prolongation of the QTcF interval. 5.4 Increased QT Prolongation With Concomitant Use of Tamoxifen KISQALI is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen. In MONALEESA-7, the observed mean QTcF increase from baseline was > 10 ms higher in the tamoxifen plus placebo subgroup compared with the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) plus placebo subgroup. In the placebo arm, an increase of > 60 ms from baseline occurred in 6/90 (7%) of patients receiving tamoxifen, and in no patients receiving an NSAI. An increase of > 60 ms from baseline in the QTcF interval was observed in 14/87 (16%) of patients in the KISQALI and tamoxifen combination and in 18/245 (7%) of patients receiving KISQALI plus an NSAI [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . 5.5 Hepatobiliary Toxicity In MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-7 and MONALEESA-3, increases in transaminases were observed. Across all studies, Grade 3 or 4 increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (11% vs. 2.1%) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (8% vs. 2%) were reported in the KISQALI and placebo arms, respectively. Among the patients who had Grade ≥ 3 ALT/AST elevation, the median time-to-onset was 92 days for the KISQALI plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant treatment group. The median time to resolution to Grade ≤ 2 was 21 days in the KISQALI plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant treatment group. In MONALEESA-2 and MONALEESA-3, concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than three times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, in the absence of cholestasis occurred in 6 (1%) patients and all patients recovered after discontinuation of KISQALI. No cases occurred in MONALEESA-7. Perform liver function tests (LFTs) before initiating therapy with KISQALI. Monitor LFTs every 2 weeks for first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Based on the severity of the transaminase elevations, KISQALI may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation as described in Table 5 (Dose Modification and Management for Hepatobiliary Toxicity) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Recommendations for patients who have elevated AST/ALT Grade ≥ 3 at baseline have not been established. 5.6 Neutropenia In MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-7, and MONALEESA-3, neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction (75%), and a Grade 3/4 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) was reported in 62% of patients receiving KISQALI plus an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant. Among the patients who had Grade 2, 3, or 4 neutropenia, the median time to Grade ≥ 2 neutropenia was 17 days. The median time to resolution of Grade ≥ 3 (to normalization or Grade < 3) was 12 days in the KISQALI plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant treatment group. Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients receiving KISQALI plus an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant. Treatment discontinuation due to neutropenia was 1%. Perform complete blood count (CBC) before initiating therapy with KISQALI. Monitor CBC every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the neutropenia, KISQALI may require dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in Table 6 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, KISQALI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ribociclib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicities at maternal exposures that were 0.6 and 1.5 times the human clinical exposure, respectively, based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with KISQALI and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] ."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of KISQALI with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If strong inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce KISQALI dose. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of KISQALI with strong CYP3A inducers. ( 7.2 ) CYP3A Substrates: The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices may need to be reduced when given concurrently with KISQALI. ( 7.3 ) Drugs Known to Prolong QT Interval: Avoid concomitant use of drugs known to prolong QT interval, such as anti-arrhythmic medicines. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase Ribociclib Plasma Concentrations CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ritonavir) increased ribociclib exposure in healthy subjects by 3.2-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, and voriconazole) and consider alternative concomitant medications with less potential for CYP3A inhibition. If coadministration of KISQALI with a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of KISQALI to 400 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Instruct patients to avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice, which are known to inhibit cytochrome CYP3A enzymes and may increase the exposure to ribociclib [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . 7.2 Drugs That May Decrease Ribociclib Plasma Concentrations CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) decreased the plasma exposure of ribociclib in healthy subjects by 89% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers and consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine, and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum). 7.3 Effect of KISQALI on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates with Narrow Therapeutic Index Coadministration of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with multiple doses of KISQALI (400 mg) increased the midazolam exposure by 3.8-fold in healthy subjects, compared with administration of midazolam alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . KISQALI given at the clinically relevant dose of 600 mg is predicted to increase the midazolam AUC by 5.2-fold. Therefore, caution is recommended when KISQALI is administered with CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. The dose of a sensitive CYP3A substrate with a narrow therapeutic index, including but not limited to alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, may need to be reduced as ribociclib can increase their exposure. 7.4 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval Avoid coadministration of KISQALI with medicinal products with a known potential to prolong QT, such as antiarrhythmic medicines (including, but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine, and sotalol), and other drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, bepridil, pimozide, and ondansetron) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] ."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, KISQALI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . There are no available human data informing the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ribociclib to pregnant animals during organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of post implantation loss and reduced fetal weights in rats and increased incidences of fetal abnormalities in rabbits at exposures 0.6 or 1.5 times the exposure in humans, respectively, at the highest recommended dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk of major birth defects is 2%-4% and of miscarriage is 15%-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses of ribociclib up to 1000 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. In rats, 300 mg/kg/day resulted in reduced maternal body weight gain and reduced fetal weights accompanied by skeletal changes related to the lower fetal weights. There were no significant effects on embryo-fetal viability or fetal morphology at 50 or 300 mg/kg/day. In rabbits at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day, there were adverse effects on embryo-fetal development, including increased incidences of fetal abnormalities (malformations and external, visceral, and skeletal variants) and fetal growth (lower fetal weights). These findings included reduced/small lung lobes, additional vessel on the descending aorta, additional vessel on the aortic arch, small eyes, diaphragmatic hernia, absent accessory lobe or (partly) fused lung lobes, reduced/small accessory lung lobe, extra/rudimentary 13 th ribs, misshapen hyoid bone, bent hyoid bone alae, and reduced number of phalanges in the pollex. There was no evidence of increased incidence of embryo-fetal mortality. There was no maternal toxicity observed at 30 mg/kg/day. At 300 mg/kg/day in rats and 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits, the maternal systemic exposures (AUC) were approximately 0.6 and 1.5 times, respectively, the exposure in patients at the highest recommended dose of 600 mg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known if ribociclib is present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of ribociclib on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Ribociclib and its metabolites readily passed into the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from KISQALI, advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking KISQALI and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. Data In lactating rats administered a single dose of 50 mg/kg, exposure to ribociclib was 3.56-fold higher in milk compared to maternal plasma. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on animal studies and mechanism of action, KISQALI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to starting treatment with KISQALI. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) during treatment with KISQALI and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. Infertility Males Based on animal studies, KISQALI may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of KISQALI in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 334 patients who received KISQALI in MONALEESA-2, 150 patients (45%) were ≥ 65 years of age and 35 patients (11%) were ≥ 75 years of age. Of 484 patients who received KISQALI in MONALEESA-3, 226 patients (47%) were ≥ 65 years of age and 65 patients (14%) were ≥ 75 years of age. Of 248 patients who received KISQALI in MONALEESA-7, no patients were ≥ 65 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of KISQALI were observed between these patients and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). A reduced starting dose of 400 mg is recommended in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh class B) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Based on a pharmacokinetic trial in patients with hepatic impairment, mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib. The mean exposure for ribociclib was increased less than 2-fold in patients with moderate (geometric mean ratio [GMR]: 1.44 for C max ; 1.28 for AUC inf ) and severe (GMR: 1.32 for C max ; 1.29 for AUC inf ) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild (60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ≤ estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or moderate (30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment. Based on a renal impairment study in healthy subjects and non-cancer subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), a starting dose of 200 mg is recommended. KISQALI has not been studied in breast cancer patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, KISQALI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . There are no available human data informing the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ribociclib to pregnant animals during organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of post implantation loss and reduced fetal weights in rats and increased incidences of fetal abnormalities in rabbits at exposures 0.6 or 1.5 times the exposure in humans, respectively, at the highest recommended dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk of major birth defects is 2%-4% and of miscarriage is 15%-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses of ribociclib up to 1000 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. In rats, 300 mg/kg/day resulted in reduced maternal body weight gain and reduced fetal weights accompanied by skeletal changes related to the lower fetal weights. There were no significant effects on embryo-fetal viability or fetal morphology at 50 or 300 mg/kg/day. In rabbits at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day, there were adverse effects on embryo-fetal development, including increased incidences of fetal abnormalities (malformations and external, visceral, and skeletal variants) and fetal growth (lower fetal weights). These findings included reduced/small lung lobes, additional vessel on the descending aorta, additional vessel on the aortic arch, small eyes, diaphragmatic hernia, absent accessory lobe or (partly) fused lung lobes, reduced/small accessory lung lobe, extra/rudimentary 13 th ribs, misshapen hyoid bone, bent hyoid bone alae, and reduced number of phalanges in the pollex. There was no evidence of increased incidence of embryo-fetal mortality. There was no maternal toxicity observed at 30 mg/kg/day. At 300 mg/kg/day in rats and 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits, the maternal systemic exposures (AUC) were approximately 0.6 and 1.5 times, respectively, the exposure in patients at the highest recommended dose of 600 mg/day."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ribociclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6. These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins and play a crucial role in signaling pathways which lead to cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. The cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex regulates cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). In vitro , ribociclib decreased pRb phosphorylation leading to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and reduced cell proliferation in breast cancer cell lines. In vivo , treatment with single agent ribociclib in a rat xenograft model with human tumor cells led to decreased tumor volumes, which correlated with inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. In studies using patient-derived estrogen receptor positive breast cancer xenograft models, combination of ribociclib and antiestrogen (e.g., letrozole) resulted in increased tumor growth inhibition compared to each drug alone. Additionally, the combination of ribociclib and fulvestrant resulted in tumor growth inhibition in an estrogen receptor positive breast cancer xenograft model. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology Serial, triplicate ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady-state to evaluate the effect of ribociclib on the QTcF interval in patients with advanced cancer. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis included a total of 997 patients treated with ribociclib at doses ranging from 50 to 1200 mg. The analysis suggested that ribociclib causes concentration-dependent increases in the QTcF interval. The estimated mean change from baseline in QTcF for KISQALI 600 mg in combination with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant was 22.0 ms (90% CI: 20.6, 23.4) and 23.7 ms (90% CI: 22.3, 25.1), respectively, and was 34.7 ms (90% CI: 31.6, 37.8) in combination with tamoxifen at the geometric mean C max at steady-state [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ribociclib exhibited over-proportional increases in exposure (peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the time concentration curve (AUC)) across the dose range of 50 mg to 1200 mg following both single dose and repeated doses. Following repeated 600 mg once daily administration, steady-state was generally achieved after 8 days and ribociclib accumulated with a geometric mean accumulation ratio of 2.51 (range, 0.972 to 6.40). Absorption The time to reach C max (T max ) following ribociclib administration was between 1 and 4 hours. Food Effect: Compared to the fasted state, oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of KISQALI film-coated tablet with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 800 to 1000 calories with ~50% calories from fat, ~35% calories from carbohydrates, and ~15% calories from protein) had no effect on the rate and extent of absorption of ribociclib (C max GMR: 1.00; 90% CI: 0.898, 1.11; AUC inf GMR: 1.06; 90% CI: 1.01, 1.12). Distribution Binding of ribociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 70% and independent of concentration (10 to 10,000 ng/mL). Ribociclib was equally distributed between red blood cells and plasma with a mean in vivo blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.04. The apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss/F) was 1090 L based on population PK analysis. Metabolism In vitro and in vivo studies indicated ribociclib undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism mainly via CYP3A4 in humans. Following oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of radio-labeled ribociclib to humans, the primary metabolic pathways for ribociclib involved oxidation (dealkylation, C and/or N-oxygenation, oxidation (-2H)) and combinations thereof. Phase II conjugates of ribociclib Phase I metabolites involved N-acetylation, sulfation, cysteine conjugation, glycosylation and glucuronidation. Ribociclib was the major circulating drug-derived entity in plasma (44%). The major circulating metabolites included metabolite M13 (CCI284, N-hydroxylation), M4 (LEQ803, N-demethylation), and M1 (secondary glucuronide), each representing an estimated 9%, 9%, and 8% of total radioactivity, and 22%, 20%, and 18% of ribociclib exposure. Clinical activity (pharmacological and safety) of ribociclib was due primarily to parent drug, with negligible contribution from circulating metabolites. Ribociclib was extensively metabolized with unchanged drug accounting for 17% and 12% in feces and urine, respectively. Metabolite LEQ803 was a significant metabolite in excreta and represented approximately 14% and 4% of the administered dose in feces and urine, respectively. Numerous other metabolites were detected in both feces and urine in minor amounts (≤ 3% of the administered dose). Elimination The geometric mean plasma effective half-life (based on accumulation ratio) was 32.0 hours (63% CV) and the geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 25.5 L/hr (66% CV) at steady-state at 600 mg in patients with advanced cancer. The geometric mean apparent plasma terminal half-life (t ½) of ribociclib ranged from 29.7 to 54.7 hours and geometric mean CL/F of ribociclib ranged from 39.9 to 77.5 L/hr at 600 mg across studies in healthy subjects. Ribociclib is eliminated mainly via feces, with a small contribution of the renal route. In 6 healthy male subjects, following a single oral dose of radio-labeled ribociclib, 92% of the total administered radioactive dose was recovered within 22 days; feces was the major route of excretion (69%), with 23% of the dose recovered in urine. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment Based on a pharmacokinetic trial in patients with hepatic impairment, mild (Child-Pugh class A) hepatic impairment had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib. The mean exposure for ribociclib was increased less than 2-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh class B; geometric mean ratio [GMR]: 1.44 for C max ; 1.28 for AUC inf ) or severe (Child-Pugh class C; GMR: 1.32 for C max ; 1.29 for AUC inf ) hepatic impairment. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 160 patients with normal hepatic function and 47 patients with mild hepatic impairment, mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib, further supporting the findings from the dedicated hepatic impairment study. Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ribociclib was assessed in a renal impairment study in non-cancer subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , n = 9), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , n = 6), and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD; eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , n = 4) at a single ribociclib dose of 400 mg/day. In subjects with severe renal impairment and ESRD, AUC inf increased 2.37-fold and 3.81-fold, and C max increased 2.10-fold and 2.68-fold relative to the exposure in non-cancer study participants with normal renal function. Mild (60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ≤ eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib based on a population PK analysis that included 438 cancer patients with normal renal function, 488 patients with mild renal impairment, and 113 patients with moderate renal impairment. In addition, in a sub-group analysis of data from studies following oral administration of ribociclib 600 mg as a single dose or repeat doses in cancer patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, AUC and C max were comparable to patients with normal renal function, suggesting no clinically meaningful effect of mild or moderate renal impairment on ribociclib exposure. Effect of Age, Weight, Gender, and Race Population PK analysis showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, body weight, gender, or race on the systemic exposure of ribociclib. Drug Interaction Studies Drugs That Affect Ribociclib Plasma Concentrations CYP3A Inhibitors: A drug interaction trial in healthy subjects was conducted with ritonavir (a strong CYP3A inhibitor). Compared to ribociclib alone, ritonavir (100 mg twice a day for 14 days) increased ribociclib C max and AUC inf by 1.7-fold and 3.2-fold, respectively, following a single 400 mg ribociclib dose. C max and AUC for LEQ803 (a prominent metabolite of LEE011, accounting for less than 10% of parent exposure) decreased by 96% and 98%, respectively. A moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (erythromycin) is predicted to increase ribociclib C max and AUC by 1.3-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively. CYP3A Inducers: A drug interaction trial in healthy subjects was conducted with rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer). Compared to ribociclib alone, rifampicin (600 mg daily for 14 days) decreased ribociclib C max and AUC inf by 81% and 89%, respectively, following a single 600 mg ribociclib dose. LEQ803 C max increased 1.7-fold and AUC inf decreased by 27%, respectively. A moderate CYP3A inducer (efavirenz) is predicted to decrease ribociclib C max and AUC by 37% and 60%, respectively. Drugs That are Affected by KISQALI CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 Substrates: A drug interaction trial in healthy subjects was conducted as a cocktail study with midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) and caffeine (sensitive CYP1A2 substrate). Compared to midazolam and caffeine alone, multiple doses of ribociclib (400 mg once daily for 8 days) increased midazolam C max and AUC inf by 2.1-fold and 3.8-fold, respectively. Administration of ribociclib at 600 mg once daily is predicted to increase midazolam C max and AUC by 2.4-fold and 5.2-fold, respectively. The effect of multiple doses of 400 mg ribociclib on caffeine was minimal, with C max decreased by 10% and AUC inf increased slightly by 20%. Only weak inhibitory effects on CYP1A2 substrates are predicted at 600 mg ribociclib once daily dose. Gastric pH-Elevating Agents: Coadministration of ribociclib with drugs that elevate the gastric pH was not evaluated in a clinical trial; however, altered ribociclib absorption was not identified in a population PK analysis and was not predicted using physiology based PK models. Letrozole: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer and population PK analysis indicated no drug interaction between ribociclib and letrozole following coadministration of the drugs. Anastrozole: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer indicated no clinically relevant drug interaction between ribociclib and anastrozole following coadministration of the drugs. Exemestane: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer indicated no clinically relevant drug interaction between ribociclib and exemestane following coadministration of the drugs. Fulvestrant: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer indicated no clinically relevant effect of fulvestrant on ribociclib exposure following coadministration of the drugs. Tamoxifen: KISQALI is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen. Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer indicated that tamoxifen C max and AUC increased approximately 2-fold following coadministration of 600 mg ribociclib. In vitro Studies Effect of ribociclib on CYP Enzymes: In vitro , ribociclib was a reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 and a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro evaluations indicated that KISQALI has no potential to inhibit the activities of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations. It has no potential for time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, and no induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Effect of ribociclib on Transporters: In vitro evaluations indicated that KISQALI has a low potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters P-gp, OATP1B1/B3, OCT1, MATEK2 at clinically relevant concentrations. KISQALI may inhibit BCRP, OCT2, MATE1, and human BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations. Effect of Transporters on ribociclib: Based on in vitro data, P-gp and BCRP mediated transport are unlikely to affect the extent of oral absorption of ribociclib at therapeutic doses. Ribociclib is not a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1/1B3 or OCT1 in vitro ."

        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Ribociclib exhibited over-proportional increases in exposure (peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the time concentration curve (AUC)) across the dose range of 50 mg to 1200 mg following both single dose and repeated doses. Following repeated 600 mg once daily administration, steady-state was generally achieved after 8 days and ribociclib accumulated with a geometric mean accumulation ratio of 2.51 (range, 0.972 to 6.40). Absorption The time to reach C max (T max ) following ribociclib administration was between 1 and 4 hours. Food Effect: Compared to the fasted state, oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of KISQALI film-coated tablet with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 800 to 1000 calories with ~50% calories from fat, ~35% calories from carbohydrates, and ~15% calories from protein) had no effect on the rate and extent of absorption of ribociclib (C max GMR: 1.00; 90% CI: 0.898, 1.11; AUC inf GMR: 1.06; 90% CI: 1.01, 1.12).

The geometric mean apparent plasma terminal half-life (t ½) of ribociclib ranged from 29.7 to 54.7 hours and geometric mean CL/F of ribociclib ranged from 39.9 to 77.5 L/hr at 600 mg across studies in healthy subjects. Ribociclib is eliminated mainly via feces, with a small contribution of the renal route. In 6 healthy male subjects, following a single oral dose of radio-labeled ribociclib, 92% of the total administered radioactive dose was recovered within 22 days; feces was the major route of excretion (69%), with 23% of the dose recovered in urine. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment Based on a pharmacokinetic trial in patients with hepatic impairment, mild (Child-Pugh class A) hepatic impairment had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib. The mean exposure for ribociclib was increased less than 2-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh class B; geometric mean ratio [GMR]: 1.44 for C max ; 1.28 for AUC inf ) or severe (Child-Pugh class C; GMR: 1.32 for C max ; 1.29 for AUC inf ) hepatic impairment. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 160 patients with normal hepatic function and 47 patients with mild hepatic impairment, mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib, further supporting the findings from the dedicated hepatic impairment study.

In subjects with severe renal impairment and ESRD, AUC inf increased 2.37-fold and 3.81-fold, and C max increased 2.10-fold and 2.68-fold relative to the exposure in non-cancer study participants with normal renal function. Mild (60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ≤ eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib based on a population PK analysis that included 438 cancer patients with normal renal function, 488 patients with mild renal impairment, and 113 patients with moderate renal impairment. In addition, in a sub-group analysis of data from studies following oral administration of ribociclib 600 mg as a single dose or repeat doses in cancer patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, AUC and C max were comparable to patients with normal renal function, suggesting no clinically meaningful effect of mild or moderate renal impairment on ribociclib exposure. Effect of Age, Weight, Gender, and Race Population PK analysis showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, body weight, gender, or race on the systemic exposure of ribociclib. Drug Interaction Studies Drugs That Affect Ribociclib Plasma Concentrations CYP3A Inhibitors: A drug interaction trial in healthy subjects was conducted with ritonavir (a strong CYP3A inhibitor). Compared to ribociclib alone, ritonavir (100 mg twice a day for 14 days) increased ribociclib C max and AUC inf by 1.7-fold and 3.2-fold, respectively, following a single 400 mg ribociclib dose. C max and AUC for LEQ803 (a prominent metabolite of LEE011, accounting for less than 10% of parent exposure) decreased by 96% and 98%, respectively. A moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (erythromycin) is predicted to increase ribociclib C max and AUC by 1.3-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively. CYP3A Inducers: A drug interaction trial in healthy subjects was conducted with rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer). Compared to ribociclib alone, rifampicin (600 mg daily for 14 days) decreased ribociclib C max and AUC inf by 81% and 89%, respectively, following a single 600 mg ribociclib dose. LEQ803 C max increased 1.7-fold and AUC inf decreased by 27%, respectively. A moderate CYP3A inducer (efavirenz) is predicted to decrease ribociclib C max and AUC by 37% and 60%, respectively. Drugs That are Affected by KISQALI CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 Substrates: A drug interaction trial in healthy subjects was conducted as a cocktail study with midazolam (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) and caffeine (sensitive CYP1A2 substrate). Compared to midazolam and caffeine alone, multiple doses of ribociclib (400 mg once daily for 8 days) increased midazolam C max and AUC inf by 2.1-fold and 3.8-fold, respectively. Administration of ribociclib at 600 mg once daily is predicted to increase midazolam C max and AUC by 2.4-fold and 5.2-fold, respectively. The effect of multiple doses of 400 mg ribociclib on caffeine was minimal, with C max decreased by 10% and AUC inf increased slightly by 20%. Only weak inhibitory effects on CYP1A2 substrates are predicted at 600 mg ribociclib once daily dose. Gastric pH-Elevating Agents: Coadministration of ribociclib with drugs that elevate the gastric pH was not evaluated in a clinical trial; however, altered ribociclib absorption was not identified in a population PK analysis and was not predicted using physiology based PK models. Letrozole: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer and population PK analysis indicated no drug interaction between ribociclib and letrozole following coadministration of the drugs. Anastrozole: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer indicated no clinically relevant drug interaction between ribociclib and anastrozole following coadministration of the drugs. Exemestane: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer indicated no clinically relevant drug interaction between ribociclib and exemestane following coadministration of the drugs. Fulvestrant: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer indicated no clinically relevant effect of fulvestrant on ribociclib exposure following coadministration of the drugs. Tamoxifen: KISQALI is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen. Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer indicated that tamoxifen C max and AUC increased approximately 2-fold following coadministration of 600 mg ribociclib. In vitro Studies Effect of ribociclib on CYP Enzymes: In vitro , ribociclib was a reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 and a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro evaluations indicated that KISQALI has no potential to inhibit the activities of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations. It has no potential for time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, and no induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. Effect of ribociclib on Transporters: In vitro evaluations indicated that KISQALI has a low potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters P-gp, OATP1B1/B3, OCT1, MATEK2 at clinically relevant concentrations. KISQALI may inhibit BCRP, OCT2, MATE1, and human BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations. Effect of Transporters on ribociclib: Based on in vitro data, P-gp and BCRP mediated transport are unlikely to affect the extent of oral absorption of ribociclib at therapeutic doses. Ribociclib is not a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1/1B3 or OCT1 in vitro ."

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2-year carcinogenicity study with oral administration of ribociclib daily in cycles of 3 weeks on/1 week off, ribociclib was not carcinogenic at doses up to 50 mg/kg in male rats and 600 mg/kg in female rats. Systemic exposure in male and female rats were 1.3 and 1.8 times, respectively, the human exposure at the highest recommended dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC. Ribociclib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay or an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, female rats received oral doses of ribociclib for 14 days prior to mating through the first week of pregnancy. Ribociclib did not affect reproductive function, fertility or early embryonic development at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 times the clinical exposure in patients at the highest recommended dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC). A fertility study in male rats has not been performed with ribociclib. In repeat-dose toxicity studies with oral administration of ribociclib daily for 3 weeks on /1 week off in rats up to 26 weeks duration and dogs up to 39 weeks duration, atrophic changes in testes were reported. Findings included degeneration of seminiferous tubular epithelia in the testes and hypospermia and luminal cellular debris in the epididymides of rats and dogs and vacuolation of epithelia in the epididymides of rats. These findings were observed at doses ≥ 75 mg/kg in rats and ≥ 1 mg/kg in dogs which resulted in systemic exposures that were 1.4 and 0.03 times the human exposure at the highest recommended daily dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC, respectively. These effects can be linked to a direct anti-proliferative effect on the testicular germ cells resulting in atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and showed a trend towards reversibility in rats and dogs after a four-week non-dosing period. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In vivo cardiac safety studies in dogs demonstrated dose and concentration related QTc interval prolongation at an exposure similar to patients receiving the recommended dose of 600 mg. There is a potential to induce incidences of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) at elevated exposures (approximately 5-fold the anticipated clinical C max )."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES MONALEESA-2: KISQALI in Combination with Letrozole Postmenopausal Women with HR-positive, HER2-negative Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer for Initial Endocrine-Based Therapy MONALEESA-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study of KISQALI plus letrozole vs. placebo plus letrozole conducted in postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer who received no prior therapy for advanced disease. A total of 668 patients were randomized to receive either KISQALI plus letrozole (n = 334) or placebo plus letrozole (n = 334), stratified according to the presence of liver and/or lung metastases. Letrozole 2.5 mg was given orally once daily for 28 days, with either KISQALI 600 mg or placebo orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure for the study was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Patients enrolled in MONALEESA-2 had a median age of 62 years (range, 23 to 91) and 45% of patients were older than 65. The majority of patients were White (82%), and all patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. A total of 47% of patients had received chemotherapy and 51% had received antihormonal therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Thirty-four percent (34%) of patients had de novo metastatic disease, 21% had bone only disease, and 59% had visceral disease. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 14, Figure 1 and Figure 2. The PFS assessment based on a blinded independent central radiological review was consistent with investigator assessment. Consistent results were observed across patient subgroups of prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapies, liver and/or lung involvement, and bone-only metastatic disease.

A total of 672 patients were randomized to receive KISQALI plus NSAI or tamoxifen plus goserelin (n = 335) or placebo plus NSAI or tamoxifen plus goserelin (n = 337), stratified according to the presence of liver and/or lung metastases, prior chemotherapy for advanced disease and endocrine combination partner (tamoxifen and goserelin vs. NSAI and goserelin). NSAI (letrozole 2.5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg) or tamoxifen 20 mg were given orally once daily on a continuous daily schedule, goserelin was administered as a sub-cutaneous injection on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle, with either KISQALI 600 mg or placebo orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure for the study was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Patients enrolled in MONALEESA-7 had a median age of 44 years (range, 25 to 58) and were primarily White (58%), Asian (29%), or Black (3%). Nearly all patients (99%) had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Of the 672 patients, 33% had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant vs. 18% in the neoadjuvant setting and 40% had received endocrine therapy in the adjuvant vs. 0.7% in the neoadjuvant setting prior to study entry. Forty percent (40%) of patients had de novo metastatic disease, 24% had bone only disease, and 57% had visceral disease. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between study arms, and endocrine combination partner. The efficacy results from a pre-specified subgroup analysis of 495 patients who had received KISQALI or placebo with NSAI plus goserelin are summarized in Table 15, Figure 3, and Figure 4.
