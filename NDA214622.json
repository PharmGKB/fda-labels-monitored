        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ocular Toxicity TRUSELTIQ can cause retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED). Perform comprehensive ophthalmic examination including optical coherence tomography (OCT) prior to initiation of TRUSELTIQ and at 1 month, at 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter during treatment. Withhold as recommended. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Hyperphosphatemia and Soft Tissue Mineralization: Increases in phosphate levels can cause hyperphosphatemia leading to soft tissue mineralization, cutaneous calcinosis, non-uremic calciphylaxis, vascular calcification, and myocardial calcification. Withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue as recommended. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Ocular Toxicity Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED) TRUSELTIQ can cause RPED, which may cause symptoms such as blurred vision. Among 351 patients who received TRUSELTIQ across clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] where ophthalmologic monitoring did not routinely include optical coherence tomography (OCT), RPED occurred in 11% of patients, including patients with asymptomatic RPED. The median time to first onset of RPED was 26 days. RPED led to dose interruption/reduction of TRUSELTIQ in 3.4% of patients, and permanent discontinuation in 0.6% of patients. Perform a comprehensive ophthalmic examination including OCT prior to initiation of TRUSELTIQ, at 1 month, at 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter during treatment. Refer patients for ophthalmic evaluation urgently for onset of visual symptoms, and follow-up every 3 weeks until resolution or discontinuation of TRUSELTIQ. Withhold TRUSELTIQ as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Dry Eye Among 351 patients who received TRUSELTIQ across clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ], dry eye occurred in 29% of patients. Treat patients with ocular demulcents as needed. 5.2 Hyperphosphatemia and Soft Tissue Mineralization TRUSELTIQ can cause hyperphosphatemia leading to soft tissue mineralization, cutaneous calcinosis, non-uremic calciphylaxis, vascular calcification, and myocardial calcification. Increases in phosphate levels are a pharmacodynamic effect of TRUSELTIQ [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ]. Among 351 patients who received TRUSELTIQ across clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ], hyperphosphatemia was reported in 82% of patients based on laboratory values above the upper limit of normal. The median time to onset of hyperphosphatemia was 8 days (range 1-349). Phosphate binders were received by 83% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ. Monitor for hyperphosphatemia throughout treatment. Initiate phosphate lowering therapy when serum phosphate level is >5.5 mg/dL. For serum phosphate level >7.5 mg/dL, withhold TRUSELTIQ and initiate phosphate lowering therapy. Withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TRUSELTIQ based on duration and severity of hyperphosphatemia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action, TRUSELTIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Oral administration of infigratinib to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis caused malformations, fetal growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death at maternal exposures lower than the human exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the clinical dose of 125 mg. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRUSELTIQ and for 1 month after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRUSELTIQ and for 1 month after the final dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ].",

Previously Treated, Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma The safety of TRUSELTIQ was evaluated in Study CBGJ398X2204, which included 108 patients with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or other rearrangement [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. Patients were treated orally with TRUSELTIQ 125 mg once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off therapy, in 28-day cycles, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months (range: 0.03 to 28.3 months). The median age of TRUSELTIQ treated patients was 53 years (range 23-81), 62% were females, and 72% were White. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 32% of patients receiving TRUSELTIQ. Serious adverse reactions in ≥2% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ included infections, anemia, pyrexia, abdominal pain, hypercalcemia, and sepsis. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1 (0.9%) patient who received TRUSELTIQ and was due to sepsis. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 15% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ. Adverse reactions requiring permanent discontinuation in ≥1% of patients were blood creatinine increased, fatigue, subretinal fluid, and calcinosis. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 64% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in ≥5% of patients included hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, stomatitis, diarrhea, and blood creatinine increased. Dosage reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 60% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reductions in ≥2% of patients who received TRUSELTIQ included hyperphosphatemia, stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, increased blood creatinine, increased lipase, hypercalcemia, and onycholysis. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were nail toxicity, stomatitis, dry eye, fatigue, alopecia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, arthralgia, dysgeusia, constipation, abdominal pain, dry mouth, eyelash changes, diarrhea, dry skin, decreased appetite, vision blurred and vomiting. The most common laboratory abnormalities (≥20%) were increased creatinine, increased phosphate, decreased phosphate, increased alkaline phosphatase, decreased hemoglobin, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased lipase, increased calcium, decreased lymphocytes, decreased sodium, increased triglycerides, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased urate, decreased platelets, decreased leukocytes, decreased albumin, increased bilirubin and decreased potassium.

        "8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action TRUSELTIQ can cause fetal harm or loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 13.1 ) ]. There are no available data on the use of TRUSELTIQ during pregnancy. Oral administration of infigratinib to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures below the human exposure at the clinical dose of 125 mg resulted in malformations, fetal growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Once daily oral administration of infigratinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in an increase in embryo-fetal lethality at 10 mg/kg/day and reductions in fetal body weights at ≥3 mg/kg/day (<0.1 times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 125 mg). Fetal abnormalities (external, soft tissue, and skeletal) were increased at ≥1 mg/kg/day (<0.1 times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 125 mg). In the embryo-fetal portion of a rat fertility study, infigratinib decreased the mean number of embryos and increased nonviable embryos and post-implantation loss in females at 3 mg/kg/day. Once daily oral administration of infigratinib at ≥0.3 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits resulted in maternal toxicity and a corresponding reduction in fetal body weights. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of infigratinib or its metabolites in human milk, or their effects on either the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children from TRUSELTIQ, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 month after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential TRUSELTIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TRUSELTIQ. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRUSELTIQ and for 1 month after the final dose. Males Advise males that are partnered with females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRUSELTIQ and for 1 month after the final dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TRUSELTIQ in pediatric patients have not been established. Animal Toxicity Data In rat and dog repeat-dose toxicity studies ≥13 weeks in duration, animals displayed toxicities in bones (rats and dogs) and teeth (rats) at exposures lower than the human exposure at the clinical dose of 125 mg. Once daily oral administration of infigratinib in a 13-week rat study resulted in incisor degeneration (degeneration of enamel and loss of ameloblast layer). Once daily oral administration of infigratinib in a 26-week rat study resulted in bone effects (decreased bone strength consistent with decreases in total bone mineral density in lumbar vertebral bodies). Once daily oral administration of infigratinib in a 39-week dog study resulted in increased growth plate thickness and fractures associated with increased physeal thickness, focal mixed reaction, and bone loss. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 351 patients treated with TRUSELTIQ in clinical studies, 33% were 65 years or older, and 10% were 75 years or older.

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action TRUSELTIQ can cause fetal harm or loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 13.1 ) ]. There are no available data on the use of TRUSELTIQ during pregnancy. Oral administration of infigratinib to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures below the human exposure at the clinical dose of 125 mg resulted in malformations, fetal growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Once daily oral administration of infigratinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in an increase in embryo-fetal lethality at 10 mg/kg/day and reductions in fetal body weights at ≥3 mg/kg/day (<0.1 times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 125 mg). Fetal abnormalities (external, soft tissue, and skeletal) were increased at ≥1 mg/kg/day (<0.1 times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 125 mg). In the embryo-fetal portion of a rat fertility study, infigratinib decreased the mean number of embryos and increased nonviable embryos and post-implantation loss in females at 3 mg/kg/day. Once daily oral administration of infigratinib at ≥0.3 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits resulted in maternal toxicity and a corresponding reduction in fetal body weights.",
        "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of infigratinib or its metabolites in human milk, or their effects on either the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children from TRUSELTIQ, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 month after the final dose.",

        "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Infigratinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor of FGFR with IC 50 values of 1.1, 1, 2, and 61 nM for FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4, respectively. The major human metabolites of infigratinib, BHS697 and CQM157, have similar in vitro binding affinities for FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 compared to infigratinib. Infigratinib inhibited FGFR signaling and decreased cell proliferation in cancer cell lines with activating FGFR amplifications, mutations, or fusions. Constitutive FGFR signaling can support the proliferation and survival of malignant cells. Infigratinib had anti-tumor activity in mouse and rat xenograft models of human tumors with activating FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations, including two patient-derived xenograft models of cholangiocarcinoma that expressed FGFR2-TTC28 or FGFR2-TRA2B fusions. Infigratinib demonstrated brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (based on AUC 0-inf ) of 0.682 in rats after a single oral dose. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Serum Phosphate TRUSELTIQ increased serum phosphate levels due to FGFR inhibition. Serum phosphate increased with increasing exposures across the dose range of 20 to 150 mg once daily (0.16 to 1.2 times the approved recommended dosage), with increased risk of hyperphosphatemia with higher exposure to TRUSELTIQ. Cardiac Electrophysiology At the recommended dosing regimen, TRUSELTIQ does not result in a large mean increase (i.e., >20 msec) in the QTc interval. The QT effect of infigratinib at higher exposures associated with CYP3A inhibition has not been studied. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The infigratinib pharmacokinetic parameters are presented following administration of the approved recommended dosage in cholangiocarcinoma patients, unless otherwise specified. The mean (coefficient of variation [%CV]) steady-state maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the curve over a dosing interval (AUC 0‑24h ) of infigratinib and active metabolites, BHS697 and CQM157, are presented in Table 5 . Table 5: Mean (%CV) Exposure of Infigratinib and Active Metabolites Infigratinib BHS697 CQM157 C max 282.5 ng/mL (54%) 42.1 ng/mL (65%) 15.7 ng/mL (92%) AUC 0‑24h 3780 ng•h/mL (59%) 717 ng•h/mL (55%) 428 ng•h/mL (72%) Infigratinib C max and AUC increased more than proportionally across the dose range of 5 to 150 mg (0.04 to 1.2 times the approved recommended dose). Steady state was achieved within 15 days and the mean accumulation ratio was 8- and 5-fold for C max and AUC, respectively. Absorption Median (range) time to achieve peak infigratinib plasma concentration (t max ) was 6 hours (2 to 7 hours) at steady state. Effect of Food Following administration of TRUSELTIQ with a high-fat and high-calorie meal (800 to 1,000 calories with approximately 50% of total caloric content of the meal from fat) in healthy subjects, the mean AUC inf of infigratinib increased by 80%-120% and C max increased by 60%-80%, the median T max shifted from 4 hours to 6 hours. Following administration of TRUSELTIQ with a low-fat low-calorie meal (approximately 330 calories with 20% of total caloric content of the meal from fat), the mean AUC inf of infigratinib increased by 70%, C max increased by 90%, and the median T max did not change. Distribution The geometric mean (CV%) apparent volume of distribution of infigratinib was 1600 L (33%) at steady state. The mean infigratinib protein binding was 96.8%, primarily to lipoprotein, and was dependent of drug concentration. Elimination The geometric mean (CV%) total apparent clearance (CL/F) of infigratinib was 33.1 L/h (59%) at steady state. The geometric mean (CV%) terminal half-life of infigratinib was 33.5 h (39%) at steady state. Metabolism Infigratinib is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 (~94%) and to a lesser extent by FMO3 (6%) in vitro. The major drug-related moiety in plasma was unchanged infigratinib (38% of dose) in a human [ 14 C] mass balance study, followed by two active metabolites, BHS697 and CQM157 (each at >10% of dose). BHS697 is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and CQM157 is metabolized through both Phase I and Phase II biotransformation pathways. BHS697 and CQM157 contribute about 16% to 33% and 9% to 12% of overall pharmacologic activity, respectively. Excretion After a single oral 125 mg dose of radiolabeled infigratinib in healthy subjects, approximately 77% of the dose was recovered in feces (3.4% as unchanged) and 7.2% in urine (1.9% as unchanged). Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the systemic exposure of infigratinib were observed based on age (19‑86 years), sex, race/ethnicity (White 70.7%, Black 15.4%, and Asian 8%), or body weight (36.4-169 kg). Patients with Renal Impairment The relative potency adjusted steady state AUC of infigratinib plus its active metabolites (BHS697, CQM157) in plasma increased by 32% and 37% in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 60 to 89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) and moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min), respectively, relative to patients with normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min). The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) or renal dialysis in end-stage renal disease on infigratinib exposure is unknown. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The relative potency adjusted steady state AUC of infigratinib plus its active metabolites (BHS697, CQM157) in plasma increased by 47%-62% and 99% in patients with mild (total bilirubin > upper limit of normal [ULN] to 1.5 × ULN or AST > ULN) and moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 × ULN with any AST), respectively, relative to patients with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST ≤ ULN).

        "14. CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Cholangiocarcinoma Study CBGJ398X2204 (NCT02150967), a multicenter open-label single-arm trial, evaluated the efficacy of TRUSELTIQ in 108 patients with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement as determined for enrollment by local (89%) or central testing (11%). Qualifying in-frame fusions and other rearrangements were predicted to have a breakpoint within intron 17/exon 18 of the FGFR2 gene that leaves the FGFR2 kinase domain intact. Patients received TRUSELTIQ at a dosage of 125 mg orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off therapy, in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR), as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The median age was 53 years (range: 23 to 81 years), 62% were female, 72% were White, 3.7% were Black or African American, 10% were Asian, and 99% had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (42%) or 1 (57%). The presence of FGFR2 fusions or other rearrangements was determined in 104 enrolled patients (96%) with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) testing. Eighty-eight (81%) patients had in-frame FGFR2 fusions, and BICC1 the most commonly reported fusion partner (n=27, 25%). Twenty (19%) patients had other FGFR2 rearrangements that may not be in-frame with the partner gene or the partner gene was not identifiable. Ninety-nine percent of patients had metastatic (Stage IV) disease at the time of study entry. All patients had received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy, 32% had 2 prior lines of therapy, and 29% had 3 or more prior lines of therapy.

        "14.1 Cholangiocarcinoma Study CBGJ398X2204 (NCT02150967), a multicenter open-label single-arm trial, evaluated the efficacy of TRUSELTIQ in 108 patients with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement as determined for enrollment by local (89%) or central testing (11%). Qualifying in-frame fusions and other rearrangements were predicted to have a breakpoint within intron 17/exon 18 of the FGFR2 gene that leaves the FGFR2 kinase domain intact. Patients received TRUSELTIQ at a dosage of 125 mg orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off therapy, in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR), as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The median age was 53 years (range: 23 to 81 years), 62% were female, 72% were White, 3.7% were Black or African American, 10% were Asian, and 99% had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (42%) or 1 (57%). The presence of FGFR2 fusions or other rearrangements was determined in 104 enrolled patients (96%) with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) testing. Eighty-eight (81%) patients had in-frame FGFR2 fusions, and BICC1 the most commonly reported fusion partner (n=27, 25%). Twenty (19%) patients had other FGFR2 rearrangements that may not be in-frame with the partner gene or the partner gene was not identifiable. Ninety-nine percent of patients had metastatic (Stage IV) disease at the time of study entry. All patients had received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy, 32% had 2 prior lines of therapy, and 29% had 3 or more prior lines of therapy. Ninety-nine percent of patients received prior gemcitabine-based therapy and most (88%) had progressed on their prior gemcitabine-based therapy. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 6 . The median time to response was 3.6 months (range 1.4 – 7.4 months).
