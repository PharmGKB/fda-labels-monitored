        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Risk of Serious Hepatotoxicity with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inducers: Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half-lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating LORBRENA. ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) • Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects: CNS effects include seizures, psychotic effects and changes in cognitive function, mood (including suicidal ideation), speech, mental status, and sleep. Withhold and resume LORBRENA at same or reduced dose or permanently discontinue LORBRENA based on severity. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) • Hyperlipidemia: Initiate or increase the dose of lipid-lowering agents. Withhold and resume LORBRENA at same or reduced dose based on severity. ( 2.3 , 5.3 ) • Atrioventricular Block: Withhold and resume LORBRENA at same or reduced dose based on severity. ( 2.3 , 5.4 ) • Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis: Immediately withhold LORBRENA in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue LORBRENA for treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis of any severity. ( 2.3 , 5.5 ) • Hypertension: Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and then at least monthly during treatment. For severe hypertension, withhold LORBRENA, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue. ( 2.3 , 5.6 ) • Hyperglycemia: Assess fasting serum glucose prior to starting LORBRENA and regularly during treatment. If not adequately controlled with optimal medical management, withhold LORBRENA, then consider dose reduction or permanently discontinue, based on severity. ( 2.3 , 5.7 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise males and females of reproductive potential to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception. ( 5.8 , 7.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Risk of Serious Hepatotoxicity with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inducers Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in 10 of 12 healthy subjects receiving a single dose of LORBRENA with multiple daily doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer. Grade 4 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations occurred in 50% of subjects, Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 33% and Grade 2 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 8%. ALT or AST elevations occurred within 3 days and returned to within normal limits after a median of 15 days (7 to 34 days); the median time to recovery was 18 days in subjects with Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations and 7 days in subjects with Grade 2 ALT or AST elevations [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers. Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half-lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating LORBRENA [see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects A broad spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) effects can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA. These include seizures, psychotic effects and changes in cognitive function, mood (including suicidal ideation), speech, mental status, and sleep. Overall, CNS effects occurred in 52% of the 476 patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Cognitive effects occurred in 28% of the 476 patients; 2.9% of these events were severe (Grade 3 or 4). Mood effects occurred in 21% of patients; 1.7% of these events were severe. Speech effects occurred in 11% of patients; 0.6% of these events were severe. Psychotic effects occurred in 7% of patients; 0.6% of these events were severe. Mental status changes occurred in 1.3% of patients; 1.1% of these events were severe. Seizures occurred in 1.9% of patients, sometimes in conjunction with other neurologic findings. Sleep effects occurred in 12% of patients. The median time to first onset of any CNS effect was 1.4 months (1 day to 3.4 years). Overall, 2.1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of LORBRENA for a CNS effect; 10% required temporary discontinuation and 8% required dose reduction. Withhold and resume at the same dose or at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue LORBRENA based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.3 Hyperlipidemia Increases in serum cholesterol and triglycerides can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Grade 3 or 4 elevations in total cholesterol occurred in 18% and Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides occurred in 19% of the 476 patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily. The median time to onset was 15 days for both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Approximately 4% and 7% of patients required temporary discontinuation and 1% and 3% of patients required dose reduction of LORBRENA for elevations in cholesterol and in triglycerides in Study B7461001 and Study B7461006, respectively. Eighty-three percent of patients required initiation of lipid-lowering medications, with a median time to onset of start of such medications of 17 days. Initiate or increase the dose of lipid-lowering agents in patients with hyperlipidemia. Monitor serum cholesterol and triglycerides before initiating LORBRENA, 1 and 2 months after initiating LORBRENA, and periodically thereafter. Withhold and resume at the same dose for the first occurrence; resume at the same or a reduced dose of LORBRENA for recurrence based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.4 Atrioventricular Block PR interval prolongation and atrioventricular (AV) block can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. In 476 patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily and who had a baseline electrocardiography (ECG), 1.9% experienced AV block and 0.2% experienced Grade 3 AV block and underwent pacemaker placement. Monitor ECG prior to initiating LORBRENA and periodically thereafter. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose or at the same dose in patients who undergo pacemaker placement. Permanently discontinue for recurrence in patients without a pacemaker [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.5 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Severe or life-threatening pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur with LORBRENA. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.9% of patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily, including Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients. Four patients (0.8%) discontinued LORBRENA for ILD/pneumonitis. Promptly investigate for ILD/pneumonitis in any patient who presents with worsening of respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, and fever). Immediately withhold LORBRENA in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue LORBRENA for treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis of any severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.6 Hypertension Hypertension can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Hypertension occurred in 13% of patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily, including Grade 3 or 4 in 6% of patients. The median time to onset of hypertension was 6.4 months (1 day to 2.8 years), and 2.3% of patients temporarily discontinued LORBRENA for hypertension. Control blood pressure prior to initiation of LORBRENA. Monitor blood pressure after 2 weeks and at least monthly thereafter during treatment with LORBRENA. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue LORBRENA based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.7 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Hyperglycemia occurred in 9% of patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA, including Grade 3 or 4 in 3.2% of patients. The median time to onset of hyperglycemia was 4.8 months (1 day to 2.9 years), and 0.8% of patients temporarily discontinued LORBRENA for hyperglycemia. Assess fasting serum glucose prior to initiation of LORBRENA and monitor periodically thereafter. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue LORBRENA based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, LORBRENA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of lorlatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations, increased post-implantation loss, and abortion at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception, since LORBRENA can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment with LORBRENA and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LORBRENA and for 3 months after the final dose [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] ."

Among 476 patients who received LORBRENA, 75% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 61% were exposed for greater than 1 year. In this pooled safety population, the most frequent adverse reactions in ≥ 20% of 476 patients who received LORBRENA were edema (56%), peripheral neuropathy (44%), weight gain (31%), cognitive effects (28%), fatigue (27%), dyspnea (27%), arthralgia (24%), diarrhea (23%), mood effects (21%), and cough (21%). The most frequent Grade 3–4 laboratory abnormalities in ≥ 20% of 476 patients who received LORBRENA were hypercholesterolemia (21%) and hypertriglyceridemia (21%). Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC (CROWN Study) The safety of LORBRENA was evaluated in 149 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive, locally advanced or metastatic, NSCLC who had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The median duration of exposure to LORBRENA was 16.7 months (4 days to 34.3 months) and 76% received LORBRENA for at least 12 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients treated with LORBRENA; the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4.7%), dyspnea (2.7%), respiratory failure (2.7%), cognitive effects (2.0%), and pyrexia (2.0%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.4% of patients treated with LORBRENA and included pneumonia (0.7%), respiratory failure (0.7%), cardiac failure acute (0.7%), pulmonary embolism (0.7%), and sudden death (0.7%). Permanent discontinuation of LORBRENA due to adverse reactions occurred in 6.7% of patients. The most frequent adverse reaction that led to permanent discontinuation of LORBRENA was cognitive effects (1.3%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions occurred in 49% of patients treated with LORBRENA. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose interruptions of LORBRENA were hypertriglyceridemia (7%), edema (5%), pneumonia (4.7%) cognitive effects (4.0%), mood effects (4.0%), and hypercholesterolemia (3.4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions occurred in 21% of patients treated with LORBRENA. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reductions were edema (5%), hypertriglyceridemia (4.0%), and peripheral neuropathy (3.4%). Tables 2 and 3 summarize most frequent adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients treated with LORBRENA in Study B7461006.

( 7.2 ) • Certain P-gp Substrates: Avoid concomitant use with P-gp substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious therapeutic failures. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on LORBRENA Strong CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of LORBRENA with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased lorlatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may decrease the efficacy of LORBRENA. Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in healthy subjects receiving LORBRENA with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer. In 12 healthy subjects receiving a single 100 mg dose of LORBRENA with multiple daily doses of rifampin, Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT or AST occurred in 83% of subjects and Grade 2 increases in ALT or AST occurred in 8%. A possible mechanism for hepatotoxicity is through activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) by LORBRENA and rifampin, which are both PXR agonists. LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers [see Contraindication (4) ] . Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half-lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating LORBRENA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of LORBRENA with a moderate CYP3A inducer decreased lorlatinib plasma concentrations, which may decrease the efficacy of LORBRENA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers with LORBRENA. If concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the LORBRENA dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased lorlatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of LORBRENA. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce the LORBRENA dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Fluconazole Concomitant use of LORBRENA with fluconazole may increase lorlatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of LORBRENA. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with fluconazole. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce the LORBRENA dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 7.2 Effect of LORBRENA on Other Drugs Certain CYP3A Substrates LORBRENA is a moderate CYP3A inducer. Concomitant use of LORBRENA decreases the concentration of CYP3A substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with certain CYP3A substrates, for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious therapeutic failures. If concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the CYP3A substrate dosage in accordance with approved product labeling. Certain P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates LORBRENA is a moderate P-gp inducer. Concomitant use of LORBRENA decreases the concentration of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with certain P-gp substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious therapeutic failures.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , LORBRENA can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on LORBRENA use in pregnant women. Administration of lorlatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations, increased post-implantation loss, and abortion at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily based on AUC (see Data ) . Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Preliminary embryo-fetal development studies investigating the administration of lorlatinib during the period of organogenesis were conducted in rats and rabbits. In rabbits, lorlatinib administration resulted in abortion and total loss of pregnancy at doses of 15 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg) or greater. At a dose of 4 mg/kg (approximately 0.6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg) toxicities included increased post-implantation loss and malformations including rotated limbs, malformed kidneys, domed head, high arched palate, and dilation of the cerebral ventricles. In rats, administration of lorlatinib resulted in total loss of pregnancy at doses of 4 mg/kg (approximately 5 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg) or greater. At a dose of 1 mg/kg (approximately equal to the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg) there was increased post-implantation loss, decreased fetal body weight, and malformations including gastroschisis, rotated limbs, supernumerary digits, and vessel abnormalities. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of lorlatinib or its metabolites in either human or animal milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, instruct women not to breastfeed during treatment with LORBRENA and for 7 days after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LORBRENA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception LORBRENA can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with LORBRENA and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise females of reproductive potential to use a non-hormonal method of contraception, because LORBRENA can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Males Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LORBRENA and for at least 3 months after the final dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Infertility Males Based on findings from animal studies, LORBRENA may transiently impair male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LORBRENA in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the patients in Study B7461001 (N=295) and Study B7461006 (N=149) who received 100 mg LORBRENA orally once daily, 18% and 40% of patients, respectively, were aged 65 years or older. No clinically important differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients aged 65 years or older and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN] with AST > ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 × ULN with any AST). The recommended dose of LORBRENA has not been established for patients with moderate (total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 to 3.0 × ULN with any AST) or severe (total bilirubin > 3.0 × ULN with any AST) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Reduce the dose when administering LORBRENA to patients with severe (CL cr 15 to <30 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft Gault) renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate (CL cr 30 to 89 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Lorlatinib is a kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity against ALK and ROS1 as well as TYK1, FER, FPS, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, FAK, FAK2, and ACK. Lorlatinib demonstrated in vitro activity against multiple mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including some mutations detected in tumors at the time of disease progression on crizotinib and other ALK inhibitors. In mice subcutaneously implanted with tumors harboring EML4 fusions with either ALK variant 1 or ALK mutations, including the G1202R and I1171T mutations detected in tumors at the time of disease progression on ALK inhibitors, administration of lorlatinib resulted in antitumor activity. Lorlatinib also demonstrated anti-tumor activity and prolonged survival in mice implanted intracranially with EML4-ALK-driven tumor cell lines. The overall antitumor activity of lorlatinib in in vivo models was dose-dependent and correlated with inhibition of ALK phosphorylation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-response relationships for Grade 3 or 4 hypercholesterolemia and for any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction were observed at steady-state exposures achieved at the recommended dosage, with higher probability of the occurrence of adverse reactions with increasing lorlatinib exposure. Cardiac Electrophysiology In 295 patients who received LORBRENA at the recommended dosage of 100 mg once daily and had an ECG measurement in Study B7461001, the maximum mean change from baseline for PR interval was 16.4 ms (2-sided 90% upper confidence interval [CI] 19.4 ms). Among the 284 patients with PR interval <200 ms at baseline, 14% had PR interval prolongation ≥200 ms after starting LORBRENA. The prolongation of PR interval occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. Atrioventricular block occurred in 1% of patients. In 275 patients who received LORBRENA at the recommended dosage in the activity-estimating portion of Study B7461001, no large mean increases from baseline in the QTcF interval (i.e., >20 ms) were detected. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Steady-state lorlatinib maximum plasma concentration (C max ) increases proportionally and AUC increased slightly less than proportionally over the dose range of 10 mg to 200 mg orally once daily (0.1 to 2 times the recommended dosage). At the recommended dosage, the mean (coefficient of variation [CV] %) C max was 577 ng/mL (42%) and the AUC 0–24h was 5650 ng∙h/mL (39%) in patients with cancer. Lorlatinib oral clearance increased at steady-state compared to single dose, indicating autoinduction. Absorption The median lorlatinib T max was 1.2 hours (0.5 to 4 hours) following a single oral 100 mg dose and 2 hours (0.5 to 23 hours) following 100 mg orally once daily at steady-state. The mean absolute bioavailability is 81% (90% CI 75.7%, 86.2%) after oral administration compared to intravenous administration. Effect of Food There was no clinically significant effect on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics following administration of LORBRENA with a high fat, high calorie meal (approximately 1000 calories with 150 calories from protein, 250 calories from carbohydrate, and 500 to 600 calories from fat). Distribution Lorlatinib was 66% bound to plasma proteins at a concentration of 2.4 µM. The blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.99, in vitro . The mean (CV%) steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) was 305 L (28%) following a single intravenous dose. Elimination The mean plasma half-life (t ½ ) of lorlatinib was 24 hours (40%) after a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA. The mean oral clearance (CL/F) was 11 L/h (35%) following a single oral 100 mg dose and increased to 18 L/h (39%) at steady-state, suggesting autoinduction. Metabolism Lorlatinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and UGT1A4, with minor contribution from CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, and UGT1A3, in vitro . In plasma, a benzoic acid metabolite (M8) of lorlatinib resulting from the oxidative cleavage of the amide and aromatic ether bonds of lorlatinib accounted for 21% of the circulating radioactivity. The oxidative cleavage metabolite, M8, is pharmacologically inactive. Excretion Following a single oral 100 mg dose of radiolabeled lorlatinib, 48% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged) and 41% in feces (about 9% as unchanged). Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in lorlatinib pharmacokinetics were observed based on age (19 to 85 years), sex, race/ethnicity, body weight, mild to moderate renal impairment (CL cr 30 to 89 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST), or metabolizer phenotypes for CYP3A5 and CYP2C19. The effect of moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN with any AST) on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Patients with Severe Renal Impairment Following administration of a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA, lorlatinib AUC inf increased by 42% in subjects with severe renal impairment (CL cr 15 to <30 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL cr ≥ 90 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). The pharmacokinetics of lorlatinib have not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches Effect of Strong CYP3A Inducers on Lorlatinib: Rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer that also activates PXR) 600 mg once daily for 8 days (Days 1 to 8) coadministered with a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA on Day 8 reduced the mean lorlatinib AUC inf by 85% and C max by 76%. Grade 2 to 4 increases in ALT or AST occurred within 3 days. Grade 4 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 50%, Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations in 33%, and Grade 2 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 8% of subjects. ALT and AST returned to within normal limits within 7 to 34 days (median 15 days) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Moderate CYP3A Inducers on Lorlatinib: Modafinil (a moderate CYP3A inducer) decreased AUC inf by 23% and decreased C max by 22% of a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors on Lorlatinib: Itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) increased AUC inf by 42% and increased C max by 24% of a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Fluconazole on Lorlatinib: Fluconazole is predicted to increase steady-state AUC tau and C max of lorlatinib by 59%, and 28%, respectively, following concomitant oral administration of 100 mg of LORBRENA once daily and 200 mg fluconazole once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors on Lorlatinib: No clinically significant effect on steady-state lorlatinib pharmacokinetics is predicted when used concomitantly with verapamil or erythromycin. Effect of Lorlatinib on CYP3A Substrates: LORBRENA 150 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 64% and C max by 50% of a single oral 2 mg dose of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Effect of Lorlatinib on CYP2B6 Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 25% and C max by 27% of a single oral 100 mg dose of bupropion (a sensitive CYP2B6 substrate). Effect of Lorlatinib on CYP2C9 Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 43% and C max by 15% of a single oral 100 mg dose of tolbutamide (a sensitive CYP2C9 substrate). Effect of Lorlatinib on UGT1A Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 45% and C max by 28% of a single oral 100 mg dose of acetaminophen (a UGT1A substrate). Effect of Lorlatinib on P-gp Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 67% and C max by 63% of a single oral 60 mg dose of fexofenadine (a P-gp substrate) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Effect of Acid-Reducing Agents on Lorlatinib : Concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole, did not have a clinically significant effect on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics. In Vitro Studies Effect of Lorlatinib on CYP Enzymes: Lorlatinib is a time-dependent inhibitor as well as an inducer of CYP3A and activates PXR, with the net effect in vivo being induction. Lorlatinib induces CYP2B6 and activates the human constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Lorlatinib and the major circulating metabolite, M8, do not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. M8 does not inhibit CYP3A. M8 does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A. Effects of Lorlatinib on UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): Lorlatinib and M8 do not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, or UGT2B15. Effect of Lorlatinib on Transporter Systems: Lorlatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp and activates PXR (potential to induce P-gp), with the net effect in vivo being induction. Lorlatinib inhibits organic cation transporter (OCT)1, organic anion transporter (OAT)3, multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)1, and intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Lorlatinib does not inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT2, MATE2K, or systemic BCRP. M8 does not inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, or MATE2K."

        "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure-response relationships for Grade 3 or 4 hypercholesterolemia and for any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction were observed at steady-state exposures achieved at the recommended dosage, with higher probability of the occurrence of adverse reactions with increasing lorlatinib exposure. Cardiac Electrophysiology In 295 patients who received LORBRENA at the recommended dosage of 100 mg once daily and had an ECG measurement in Study B7461001, the maximum mean change from baseline for PR interval was 16.4 ms (2-sided 90% upper confidence interval [CI] 19.4 ms). Among the 284 patients with PR interval <200 ms at baseline, 14% had PR interval prolongation ≥200 ms after starting LORBRENA. The prolongation of PR interval occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. Atrioventricular block occurred in 1% of patients. In 275 patients who received LORBRENA at the recommended dosage in the activity-estimating portion of Study B7461001, no large mean increases from baseline in the QTcF interval (i.e., >20 ms) were detected."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Steady-state lorlatinib maximum plasma concentration (C max ) increases proportionally and AUC increased slightly less than proportionally over the dose range of 10 mg to 200 mg orally once daily (0.1 to 2 times the recommended dosage). At the recommended dosage, the mean (coefficient of variation [CV] %) C max was 577 ng/mL (42%) and the AUC 0–24h was 5650 ng∙h/mL (39%) in patients with cancer. Lorlatinib oral clearance increased at steady-state compared to single dose, indicating autoinduction. Absorption The median lorlatinib T max was 1.2 hours (0.5 to 4 hours) following a single oral 100 mg dose and 2 hours (0.5 to 23 hours) following 100 mg orally once daily at steady-state. The mean absolute bioavailability is 81% (90% CI 75.7%, 86.2%) after oral administration compared to intravenous administration. Effect of Food There was no clinically significant effect on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics following administration of LORBRENA with a high fat, high calorie meal (approximately 1000 calories with 150 calories from protein, 250 calories from carbohydrate, and 500 to 600 calories from fat). Distribution Lorlatinib was 66% bound to plasma proteins at a concentration of 2.4 µM. The blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.99, in vitro . The mean (CV%) steady-state volume of distribution (V ss ) was 305 L (28%) following a single intravenous dose. Elimination The mean plasma half-life (t ½ ) of lorlatinib was 24 hours (40%) after a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA. The mean oral clearance (CL/F) was 11 L/h (35%) following a single oral 100 mg dose and increased to 18 L/h (39%) at steady-state, suggesting autoinduction. Metabolism Lorlatinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and UGT1A4, with minor contribution from CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, and UGT1A3, in vitro . In plasma, a benzoic acid metabolite (M8) of lorlatinib resulting from the oxidative cleavage of the amide and aromatic ether bonds of lorlatinib accounted for 21% of the circulating radioactivity. The oxidative cleavage metabolite, M8, is pharmacologically inactive. Excretion Following a single oral 100 mg dose of radiolabeled lorlatinib, 48% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged) and 41% in feces (about 9% as unchanged). Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in lorlatinib pharmacokinetics were observed based on age (19 to 85 years), sex, race/ethnicity, body weight, mild to moderate renal impairment (CL cr 30 to 89 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST), or metabolizer phenotypes for CYP3A5 and CYP2C19. The effect of moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN with any AST) on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Patients with Severe Renal Impairment Following administration of a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA, lorlatinib AUC inf increased by 42% in subjects with severe renal impairment (CL cr 15 to <30 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL cr ≥ 90 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). The pharmacokinetics of lorlatinib have not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches Effect of Strong CYP3A Inducers on Lorlatinib: Rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer that also activates PXR) 600 mg once daily for 8 days (Days 1 to 8) coadministered with a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA on Day 8 reduced the mean lorlatinib AUC inf by 85% and C max by 76%. Grade 2 to 4 increases in ALT or AST occurred within 3 days. Grade 4 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 50%, Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations in 33%, and Grade 2 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 8% of subjects. ALT and AST returned to within normal limits within 7 to 34 days (median 15 days) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Moderate CYP3A Inducers on Lorlatinib: Modafinil (a moderate CYP3A inducer) decreased AUC inf by 23% and decreased C max by 22% of a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors on Lorlatinib: Itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) increased AUC inf by 42% and increased C max by 24% of a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Fluconazole on Lorlatinib: Fluconazole is predicted to increase steady-state AUC tau and C max of lorlatinib by 59%, and 28%, respectively, following concomitant oral administration of 100 mg of LORBRENA once daily and 200 mg fluconazole once daily [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Effect of Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors on Lorlatinib: No clinically significant effect on steady-state lorlatinib pharmacokinetics is predicted when used concomitantly with verapamil or erythromycin. Effect of Lorlatinib on CYP3A Substrates: LORBRENA 150 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 64% and C max by 50% of a single oral 2 mg dose of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Effect of Lorlatinib on CYP2B6 Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 25% and C max by 27% of a single oral 100 mg dose of bupropion (a sensitive CYP2B6 substrate). Effect of Lorlatinib on CYP2C9 Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 43% and C max by 15% of a single oral 100 mg dose of tolbutamide (a sensitive CYP2C9 substrate). Effect of Lorlatinib on UGT1A Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 45% and C max by 28% of a single oral 100 mg dose of acetaminophen (a UGT1A substrate). Effect of Lorlatinib on P-gp Substrates: LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 67% and C max by 63% of a single oral 60 mg dose of fexofenadine (a P-gp substrate) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Effect of Acid-Reducing Agents on Lorlatinib : Concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole, did not have a clinically significant effect on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics. In Vitro Studies Effect of Lorlatinib on CYP Enzymes: Lorlatinib is a time-dependent inhibitor as well as an inducer of CYP3A and activates PXR, with the net effect in vivo being induction. Lorlatinib induces CYP2B6 and activates the human constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Lorlatinib and the major circulating metabolite, M8, do not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. M8 does not inhibit CYP3A. M8 does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A. Effects of Lorlatinib on UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT): Lorlatinib and M8 do not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, or UGT2B15. Effect of Lorlatinib on Transporter Systems: Lorlatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp and activates PXR (potential to induce P-gp), with the net effect in vivo being induction. Lorlatinib inhibits organic cation transporter (OCT)1, organic anion transporter (OAT)3, multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)1, and intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Lorlatinib does not inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OCT2, MATE2K, or systemic BCRP. M8 does not inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, or MATE2K."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC (CROWN Study) The efficacy of LORBRENA for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who had not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease was established in an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter study (Study B7461006; NCT03052608). Patients were required to have an ECOG performance status of 0–2 and ALK-positive NSCLC as identified by the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx assay. Neurologically stable patients with treated or untreated asymptomatic CNS metastases, including leptomeningeal metastases, were eligible. Patients were required to have finished radiation therapy, at least 2 weeks (for stereotactic or partial radiation) or 4 weeks (for whole brain irradiation) prior to randomization. Patients with severe acute or chronic psychiatric conditions, including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily or crizotinib 250 mg orally twice daily. Randomization was stratified by ethnic origin (Asian vs. non-Asian) and the presence or absence of CNS metastases at baseline. Treatment on both arms was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v1.1). Additional efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and tumor assessment related data by BICR, including overall response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR). In patients with measurable CNS metastases at baseline, additional outcome measures were intracranial overall response rate (IC-ORR) and intracranial duration of response (IC-DOR) by BICR. A total of 296 patients were randomized to LORBRENA (n=149) or crizotinib (n=147). The demographic characteristics of the overall study population were: median age 59 years (range: 26 to 90 years), age ≥65 years (35%), 59% female, 49% White, 44% Asian, and 0.3% Black. The ECOG performance status at baseline was 0 or 1 in 96% of patients. The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (95%) and never smoked (59%). CNS metastases were present in 26% (n=78) of patients: of these, 30 patients had measurable CNS lesions. Efficacy results from Study B7461006 as assessed by BICR are summarized in Table 6 and Figure 1. Results demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS for the LORBRENA arm over the crizotinib arm. At the data cutoff point OS data was not mature.

Patients included in this subgroup were required to have metastatic disease with at least 1 measurable target lesion according to RECIST v1.1, ECOG performance status of 0 to 2, and documented ALK rearrangement in tumor tissue as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay or by Immunohistochemistry (IHC), and received LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases, including patients with stable or decreasing steroid use within 2 weeks prior to study entry, were eligible. Patients with severe, acute, or chronic psychiatric conditions including suicidal ideation or behavior were excluded. In addition, for patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC, the extent and type of prior treatment was specified for each individual cohort (see Table 8 ). The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and intracranial ORR, according to RECIST v1.1, as assessed by Independent Central Review (ICR) committee. Data were pooled across all subgroups listed in Table 8. Additional efficacy outcome measures included DOR, and intracranial DOR. A total of 215 patients were enrolled across the subgroups in Table 8. The distribution of patients by type and extent of prior therapy is provided in Table 8. The demographic characteristics across all 215 patients were: 59% female, 51% White, 34% Asian, and the median age was 53 years (29 to 85 years) with 18% of patients ≥65 years. The ECOG performance status at baseline was 0 or 1 in 96% of patients. All patients had metastatic disease and 95% had adenocarcinoma. Brain metastases as identified by ICR were present in 69% of patients; of these, 60% had received prior radiation to the brain and 60% (n=89) had measurable disease per ICR.
