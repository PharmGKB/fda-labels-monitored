        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions (5.1) ∘ Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction, and solid organ transplant rejection. o Monitor for early identification and management. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. o Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity and type of reaction. • Infusion-Related Reactions: Interrupt, slow the rate of infusion, or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity of the reaction. (5.2) • Complications of Allogeneic HSCT: Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. (5.3) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions IMFINZI is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue IMFINZI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . In general, if IMFINZI requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 mg to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. In Patients Who did Not Receive Recent Prior Radiation In patients who received IMFINZI on clinical trials in which radiation therapy was generally not administered immediately prior to initiation of IMFINZI, the incidence of immune-mediated pneumonitis was 2.4% (34/1414), including fatal (<0.1%), and Grade 3-4 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 19 of the 34 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 5 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 19 patients (19/34) with pneumonitis who did not receive chemoradiation prior to initiation of IMFINZI. In Patients Who Received Recent Prior Radiation The incidence of pneumonitis (including radiation pneumonitis) in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC following definitive chemoradiation within 42 days prior to initiation of IMFINZI in PACIFIC was 18.3% (87/475) in patients receiving IMFINZI and 12.8% (30/234) in patients receiving placebo. Of the patients who received IMFINZI (475) 1.1% were fatal and 2.7% were Grade 3 adverse reactions. Events resolved in 50 of the 87 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 27 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 64 patients (64/87) with pneumonitis who had received chemoradiation prior to initiation of IMFINZI, while 2 patients required use of infliximab with high-dose steroids. The frequency and severity of immune-mediated pneumonitis in patients who did not receive definitive chemoradiation prior to IMFINZI were similar whether IMFINZI was given as a single agent in patients with various cancers in a pooled data set or in patients with ES-SCLC or BTC when given in combination with chemotherapy. Immune-Mediated Colitis IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated colitis that is frequently associated with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2% (37/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 4 (<0.1%) and Grade 3 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 27 of the 37 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 8 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with immune-mediated colitis, while 2 patients (2/37) required other immunosuppressants (e.g. infliximab, mycophenolate). Immune-Mediated Hepatitis IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 2.8% (52/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%) and Grade 3 (1.4%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 21 of the 52 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation of IMFINZI in 6 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with immune-mediated hepatitis, while 2 patients (2/52) required use of mycophenolate with high-dose steroids. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency: IMFINZI can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.5% (9/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 1 of the 9 patients and did not lead to permanent discontinuation of IMFINZI in any patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis : IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field cuts. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate symptomatic treatment including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue IMFINZI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Grade 3 hypophysitis/hypopituitarism occurred in <0.1% (1/1889) of patients who received IMFINZI. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids was administered in this patient. The event did not lead to permanent discontinuation of IMFINZI. Thyroid Disorders : IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Thyroiditis: Immune-mediated thyroiditis occurred in 0.5% (9/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 4 of the 9 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 1 patient. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 3 patients (3/9) with immune-mediated thyroiditis, while 8 patients (8/9) required endocrine therapy. Hyperthyroidism: Immune-mediated hyperthyroidism occurred in 2.1% (39/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI. Events resolved in 30 of the 39 patients and did not lead to permanent discontinuation of IMFINZI in any patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 9 patients (9/39) with immune-mediated hyperthyroidism, while 35 patients (35/39) required endocrine therapy. Hypothyroidism: Immune-mediated hypothyroidism occurred in 8.3% (156/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 31 of the 156 patients and did not lead to permanent discontinuation of IMFINZI in any patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 11 patients (11/156) and the majority of patients (152/156) required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which can present with diabetic ketoacidosis : Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Grade 3 immune-mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in <0.1% (1/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI. This patient required long-term insulin therapy and IMFINZI was permanently discontinued. Two additional patients (0.1%, 2/1889) had events of hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy that did not resolve at the time of reporting. Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.5% (10/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (<0.1%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 5 of the 10 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 3 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-Mediated Dermatology Reactions IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), has occurred with PD-1/L-1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue IMFINZI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Immune-mediated rash or dermatitis occurred in 1.8% (34/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 19 of the 34 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 2 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of less than 1% each in patients who received IMFINZI or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Cardiac/vascular : Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis. Nervous system : Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy. Ocular : Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment to include blindness can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal : Pancreatitis including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic. Endocrine : Hypoparathyroidism Other (hematologic/immune) : Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenia, solid organ transplant rejection. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions IMFINZI can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt, slow the rate of, or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . For Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions, consider using pre-medications with subsequent doses. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (42/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (0.3%) adverse reactions. 5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after IMFINZI Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/L-1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/L-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/L-1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of durvalumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased premature delivery, fetal loss and premature neonatal death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMFINZI and for at least 3 months after the last dose of IMFINZI [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling. • Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. • Infusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. • Most common adverse reactions (≥ 20% of patients with unresectable, Stage III NSCLC) were cough, fatigue, pneumonitis/radiation pneumonitis, upper respiratory tract infections, dyspnea, and rash. ( 6.1 ) • Most common adverse reactions (≥ 20% of patients with extensive-stage SCLC) were, nausea, fatigue/asthenia, alopecia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to IMFINZI in 1889 patients from the PACIFIC study (a randomized, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 475 patients with Stage III NSCLC), Study 1108 (an open-label, single-arm, multicohort study that enrolled 970 patients with advanced solid tumors), and an additional open-label, single-arm trial that enrolled 444 patients with metastatic lung cancer, an indication for which durvalumab is not approved. In these trials, IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Among the 1889 patients, 38% were exposed for 6 months or more and 18% were exposed for 12 months or more. The data also reflect exposure to IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy in 265 patients from the CASPIAN study (a randomized, open-label study in patients with ES-SCLC), in 338 patients from the TOPAZ-1 study (a randomized, double-blind study in patients with BTC). In the CASPIAN and TOPAZ-1 studies, IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 1,500 mg every 3 or 4 weeks. The data described in this section reflect exposure to IMFINZI in patients with Stage III NSCLC enrolled in the PACIFIC study, in patients with ES-SCLC enrolled in the CASPIAN study and in patients with BTC enrolled in the TOPAZ-1 study. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of IMFINZI in patients with Stage III NSCLC who completed concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy within 42 days prior to initiation of study drug was evaluated in the PACIFIC study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 475 patients received IMFINZI 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. The study excluded patients who had disease progression following chemoradiation, with active or prior autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study or with medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 23 to 90), 45% age 65 years or older, 70% male, 69% White, 27% Asian, 75% former smoker, 16% current smoker, and 51% had WHO performance status of 1. All patients received definitive radiotherapy as per protocol, of which 92% received a total radiation dose of 54 Gy to 66 Gy. The median duration of exposure to IMFINZI was 10 months (range: 0.2 to 12.6). IMFINZI was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 15% of patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to IMFINZI discontinuation were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis in 6% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients receiving IMFINZI. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis (7%) and pneumonia (6%). Fatal pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis and fatal pneumonia occurred in < 2% of patients and were similar across arms. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) were cough, fatigue, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis, upper respiratory tract infections, dyspnea, and rash. Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with IMFINZI. Table 3.

A total of 265 patients received IMFINZI 1,500 mg in combination with chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with active or prior autoimmune disease or with medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Among 265 patients receiving IMFINZI, 49% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 19% were exposed for 12 months or longer. Among 266 patients receiving chemotherapy alone, 57% of the patients received 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 8% of the patients received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) after chemotherapy. IMFINZI was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of the patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. These include pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis and pancytopenia (1 patient each). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 31% of patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of patients were febrile neutropenia (4.5%), pneumonia (2.3%), anemia (1.9%), pancytopenia (1.5%), pneumonitis (1.1%) and COPD (1.1%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4.9% of patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. These include pancytopenia, sepsis, septic shock, pulmonary artery thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and hepatitis (1 patient each) and sudden death (2 patients). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) were nausea, fatigue/asthenia and alopecia.

A total of 338 patients received IMFINZI 1,500 mg in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin every 3 weeks up to 8 cycles followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, HIV infection or other active infections, including tuberculosis or hepatitis C were ineligible [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. IMFINZI was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 6% of the patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. The most frequently reported events resulting in discontinuation were sepsis (3 patients) and ischemic stroke (2 patients). The remaining events were dispersed across system organ classes and reported in 1 patient each. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 47% of patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were cholangitis (7%), pyrexia (3.8%), anemia (3.6%), sepsis (3.3%) and acute kidney injury (2.4%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.6% of patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. These include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (4 patients), sepsis (2 patients), upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (2 patients). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) were fatigue, nausea, constipation, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, rash and pyrexia.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk summary Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are no data on the use of IMFINZI in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, administration of durvalumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the confirmation of pregnancy through delivery at exposure levels approximately 6 to 20 times higher than those observed at the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg (based on AUC), resulted in an increase in premature delivery, fetal loss, and premature neonatal death (see Data) . Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) is known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, durvalumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data As reported in the literature, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a central role in preserving pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. In mouse allogeneic pregnancy models, disruption of PD-L1 signaling was shown to result in an increase in fetal loss. The effects of durvalumab on prenatal and postnatal development were evaluated in reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys. Durvalumab was administered from the confirmation of pregnancy through delivery at exposure levels approximately 6 to 20 times higher than those observed at the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg (based on AUC). Administration of durvalumab resulted in premature delivery, fetal loss (abortion and stillbirth), and increase in neonatal deaths. Durvalumab was detected in infant serum on postpartum Day 1, indicating the presence of placental transfer of durvalumab. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to durvalumab may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response and immune-mediated disorders have been reported in PD-1 knockout mice. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of durvalumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG1 is excreted in human milk. Durvalumab was present in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys and was associated with premature neonatal death (see Data). Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with IMFINZI and for at least 3 months after the last dose. Data In lactating cynomolgus monkeys, durvalumab was present in breast milk at about 0.15% of maternal serum concentrations after administration of durvalumab from the confirmation of pregnancy through delivery at exposure levels approximately 6 to 20 times higher than those observed at the recommended clinical dose of 10 mg/kg (based on AUC). Administration of durvalumab resulted in premature neonatal death. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with IMFINZI. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMFINZI and for at least 3 months following the last dose of IMFINZI. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of IMFINZI have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 476 patients treated with IMFINZI in the PACIFIC study, 45% were 65 years or older, while 7.6% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years or older and younger patients. The PACIFIC study did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 75 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Safety and efficacy were similar for patients age 65 years and younger and those older than 65 in patients with ES-SCLC treated with IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy. Of the 265 patients with ES-SCLC, 101 (38%) patients were 65 years or older and 19 (7.2%) patients were 75 years or older. Of the 338 patients with BTC treated with IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy in the TOPAZ-1 study, 158 (47%) patients were 65 years or older and 38 (11%) patients were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of IMFINZI have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) can be induced by inflammatory signals (e.g., IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, and cytokine production. Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition of immune responses, without inducing antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). PD-L1 blockade with durvalumab led to increased T-cell activation in vitro and decreased tumor size in co-engrafted human tumor and immune cell xenograft mouse models. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The steady state AUC, Ctrough, and C max in patients administered with 1,500 mg every 4 weeks are 6% higher, 19% lower, and 55% higher than those administered with 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, respectively. Based on the modeling of pharmacokinetic data and exposure relationships for safety, there are no anticipated clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety for the doses of 1,500 mg every 4 weeks compared to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in patients weighing > 30 kg with NSCLC. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of durvalumab as a single agent was studied in patients with doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg (0.01 times the approved recommended dosage) to 20 mg/kg (2 times the approved recommended dosage) administered once every two, three, or four weeks. PK exposure increased more than dose-proportionally at doses < 3 mg/kg (0.3 times the approved recommended dosage) and dose proportionally at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Steady state was achieved at approximately 16 weeks. The pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is similar when assessed as a single agent and when in combination with chemotherapy. Distribution The geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) steady state volume of distribution (Vss) was 5.6 (18%) L. Elimination Durvalumab clearance decreases over time, with a mean maximal reduction (CV%) from baseline values of approximately 23% (57%) resulting in a geometric mean (CV%) steady state clearance (CLss) of 8.2 mL/h (39%) at day 365; the decrease in CLss is not considered clinically relevant. The geometric mean (CV%) terminal half-life, based on baseline CL was approximately 18 (24%) days. Specific Populations There were no clinically significant difference in pharmacokinetic of durvalumab based on age (19-96 years), body weight (31-149 kg), sex, race (White, Black, Asian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or American Indian), albumin levels (4-57 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase levels (18-15,800 U/L), creatinine levels, soluble PD-L1 (67-3,470 pg/mL), tumor type (NSCLC, SCLC and BTC), varying degrees of organ impairment including mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min), mild to moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ 3x ULN and any AST) or ECOG/WHO performance status. The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3x ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is unknown. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparison of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in the studies described below with the incidence of ADAs in other studies. Of the 2,280 patients who received IMFINZI 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks as a single-agent, 69 patients (3%) tested positive for ADAs and 12 (0.5%) tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. The development of ADAs against durvalumab appears to have no clinically relevant effect on its pharmacokinetics or safety. Of the 201 patients in the CASPIAN study who received IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy for four doses followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks, no patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Of the 240 patients in the TOPAZ-1 study who received IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy up to 8 cycles followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks, 2 (0.8%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs and neutralizing antibodies, respectively. There were insufficient numbers of patients with treatment-emergent ADAs or neutralizing antibodies (2 patients each) to determine whether ADAs have an impact on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and/or effectiveness of IMFINZI."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of durvalumab as a single agent was studied in patients with doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg (0.01 times the approved recommended dosage) to 20 mg/kg (2 times the approved recommended dosage) administered once every two, three, or four weeks. PK exposure increased more than dose-proportionally at doses < 3 mg/kg (0.3 times the approved recommended dosage) and dose proportionally at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Steady state was achieved at approximately 16 weeks. The pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is similar when assessed as a single agent and when in combination with chemotherapy. Distribution The geometric mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) steady state volume of distribution (Vss) was 5.6 (18%) L. Elimination Durvalumab clearance decreases over time, with a mean maximal reduction (CV%) from baseline values of approximately 23% (57%) resulting in a geometric mean (CV%) steady state clearance (CLss) of 8.2 mL/h (39%) at day 365; the decrease in CLss is not considered clinically relevant. The geometric mean (CV%) terminal half-life, based on baseline CL was approximately 18 (24%) days. Specific Populations There were no clinically significant difference in pharmacokinetic of durvalumab based on age (19-96 years), body weight (31-149 kg), sex, race (White, Black, Asian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or American Indian), albumin levels (4-57 g/L), lactate dehydrogenase levels (18-15,800 U/L), creatinine levels, soluble PD-L1 (67-3,470 pg/mL), tumor type (NSCLC, SCLC and BTC), varying degrees of organ impairment including mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min), mild to moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ 3x ULN and any AST) or ECOG/WHO performance status. The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 mL/min) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3x ULN and any AST) on the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is unknown."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) The efficacy of IMFINZI was evaluated in the PACIFIC study (NCT02125461), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC who completed at least 2 cycles of concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and definitive radiation within 42 days prior to initiation of the study drug and had a WHO performance status of 0 or 1. The study excluded patients who had progressed following concurrent chemoradiation, patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study or patients with medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression. Randomization was stratified by sex, age (< 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years), and smoking history (smoker vs. non-smoker). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive IMFINZI 10 mg/kg or placebo intravenously every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until unacceptable toxicity or confirmed RECIST v1.1-defined progression. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 8 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by a BICR RECIST v1.1, and overall survival (OS). Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR and DoR assessed by BICR. A total of 713 patients were randomized: 476 patients to the IMFINZI arm and 237 to the placebo arm. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 23 to 90); 70% male; 69% White and 27% Asian; 16% current smokers, 75% former smokers, and 9% never smokers; 51% WHO performance status of 1; 53% with Stage IIIA and 45% were Stage IIIB; 46% with squamous and 54% with non-squamous histology. All patients received definitive radiotherapy as per protocol, of which 92% received a total radiation dose of 54 Gy to 66 Gy; 99% of patients received concomitant platinum-based chemotherapy (55% cisplatin-based, 42% carboplatin-based chemotherapy, and 2% switched between cisplatin and carboplatin). At a pre-specified interim analysis for OS based on 299 events (61% of total planned events), the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients randomized to IMFINZI compared to placebo. The pre-specified interim analysis of PFS based on 371 events (81% of total planned events) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in patients randomized to IMFINZI compared to placebo. Table 9 and Figure 1 summarizes the efficacy results for PACIFIC. Table 9.

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival in the PACIFIC Study Figure 1 14.2 Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) The efficacy of IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin in previously untreated ES-SCLC was investigated in CASPIAN, a randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, open-label trial (NCT03043872). Eligible patients had WHO Performance Status of 0 or 1 and were suitable to receive a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen as first-line treatment for SCLC. Patients with asymptomatic or treated brain metastases were eligible. Choice of platinum agent was at the investigator’s discretion, taking into consideration the calculated creatinine clearance. Patients with history of chest radiation therapy; a history of active primary immunodeficiency; autoimmune disorders including paraneoplastic syndrome; active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders; use of systemic immunosuppressants within 14 days before the first dose of the treatment except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by the planned platinum-based therapy in cycle 1 (carboplatin or cisplatin). The evaluation of efficacy for ES-SCLC relied on comparison between: IMFINZI 1,500 mg, and investigator’s choice of carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 mg/mL/min) or cisplatin (75-80 mg/m 2 ) on Day 1 and etoposide (80-100 mg/m 2 ) intravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles, followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or Investigator’s choice of carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 mg/mL/min) or cisplatin (75-80 mg/m 2 ) on Day 1 and etoposide (80-100 mg/m 2 ) intravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle, up to 6 cycles. After completion of chemotherapy, PCI as administered per investigator discretion. Administration of IMFINZI as a single agent was permitted beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) of IMFINZI plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone. Additional efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR), per RECIST v1.1. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 28 to 82); 40% age 65 or older; 70% male; 84% White, 15% Asian, and 0.9% Black; 65% WHO/ECOG PS of 1; and 93% were former/current smokers. Ninety percent of patients had Stage IV disease and 10% had brain metastasis at baseline. A total of 25% of the patients received cisplatin and 74% of the patients received carboplatin. In the chemotherapy alone arm, 57% of the patients received 6 cycles of chemotherapy, and 8% of the patients received PCI. The OS results are summarized in Table 10 and Figure 2. Table 10.

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival in the CASPIAN Study Investigator-assessed PFS (96% of total planned events) showed a HR of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.94), with median PFS of 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.7, 6.2) in the IMFINZI plus chemotherapy arm and 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.8, 6.2) in the chemotherapy alone arm. The investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 68% (95% CI: 62%, 73%) in the IMFINZI plus chemotherapy arm and 58% (95% CI: 52%, 63%) in the chemotherapy alone arm. In the exploratory subgroup analyses of OS based on the planned platinum chemotherapy received at cycle 1, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.55, 0.89) in patients who received carboplatin, and the HR was 0.88 (95% CI 0.55, 1.41) in patients who received cisplatin. fig2 14.3 Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC) The efficacy of IMFINZI in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic BTC was investigated in TOPAZ-1 (NCT03875235), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial that enrolled 685 patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced unresectable or metastatic BTC who have not previously received systemic therapy. Patients with recurrent disease >6 months after surgery and/or completion of adjuvant therapy were eligible. Patients had an ECOG Performance status of 0 and 1 and least one target lesion by RECIST 1.1. Patients with ampullary carcinoma; active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders; HIV infection or active infections, including tuberculosis or hepatitis C; current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of IMFINZI were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by disease status (recurrent vs. initially unresectable) and primary tumor location (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [ICCA] vs. extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [ECCA] vs. gallbladder cancer [GBC]). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive: • IMFINZI 1,500 mg on Day 1+ gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m 2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle up to 8 cycles, followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks, or • Placebo on Day 1+ gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m 2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle up to 8 cycles, followed by placebo every 4 weeks. Treatment with IMFINZI or placebo continued until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment beyond disease progression was permitted if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Additional efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). Tumor assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks after the date of randomization, and then every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. The study population characteristics were: 50% male, median age of 64 years (range 20-85), 47% age 65 or older; 56% Asian, 37% White, 2% Black or African American, 0.1% American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 4% other; 51% had an ECOG PS of 1; primary tumor location was ICCA 56%, ECCA 18% and GBC 25%); 20% of patients had recurrent disease; 86% of patients had metastatic and 14% had locally advanced disease. At a pre-specified interim analysis, the trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS in patients randomized to IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy compared to placebo in combination with chemotherapy.
