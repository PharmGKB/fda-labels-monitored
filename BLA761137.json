Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Prior to administration, the PADCEV vial is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI). The reconstituted solution is subsequently diluted in an intravenous infusion bag containing either 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP. Reconstitution in Single-dose Vial 1. Follow procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs. 2. Use appropriate aseptic technique for reconstitution and preparation of dosing solutions. 3. Calculate the recommended dose based on the patient’s weight to determine the number and strength (20 mg or 30 mg) of vials needed. 4. Reconstitute each vial as follows and, if possible, direct the stream of SWFI along the walls of the vial and not directly onto the lyophilized powder: a. 20 mg vial: Add 2.3 mL of SWFI, resulting in 10 mg/mL PADCEV. b. 30 mg vial: Add 3.3 mL of SWFI, resulting in 10 mg/mL PADCEV. 5. Slowly swirl each vial until the contents are completely dissolved. Allow the reconstituted vial(s) to settle for at least 1 minute until the bubbles are gone. DO NOT SHAKE THE VIAL. Do not expose to direct sunlight. 6. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The reconstituted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to light yellow and free of visible particles. Discard any vial with visible particles or discoloration. 7. Based upon the calculated dose amount, the reconstituted solution from the vial(s) should be added to the infusion bag immediately. This product does not contain a preservative. If not used immediately, reconstituted vials may be stored for up to 24 hours in refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). DO NOT FREEZE. Discard unused vials with reconstituted solution beyond the recommended storage time. Dilution in Infusion Bag 8. Withdraw the calculated dose amount of reconstituted solution from the vial(s) and transfer into an infusion bag. 9. Dilute PADCEV with either 5% Dextrose Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. The infusion bag size should allow enough diluent to achieve a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL PADCEV. 10. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion. DO NOT SHAKE THE BAG. Do not expose to direct sunlight. 11. Visually inspect the infusion bag for any particulate matter or discoloration prior to use. The reconstituted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to light yellow and free of visible particles. DO NOT USE the infusion bag if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. 12. Discard any unused portion left in the single-dose vials. Administration 13. Immediately administer the infusion over 30 minutes through an intravenous line. 14. If the infusion is not administered immediately, the prepared infusion bag should not be stored longer than 8 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). DO NOT FREEZE. DO NOT administer PADCEV as an intravenous push or bolus. DO NOT mix PADCEV with, or administer as an infusion with, other medicinal products."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hyperglycemia: Diabetic ketoacidosis may occur in patients with and without preexisting diabetes mellitus, which may be fatal. Closely/monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. Withhold PADCEV if blood glucose is >250 mg/dL. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) • Pneumonitis/Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): Severe, life-threatening or fatal pneumonitis/ILD may occur. Withhold PADCEV for Grade 2 pneumonitis/ILD and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue PADCEV for Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis/ILD. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) • Peripheral Neuropathy: Monitor patients for new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of PADCEV. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) • Ocular Disorders: Ocular disorders, including vision changes, may occur. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of ocular disorders. Consider prophylactic artificial tears for dry eyes and treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when symptomatic ocular disorders occur. ( 5.5 ) • Infusion Site Extravasation: Ensure adequate venous access prior to administration. Monitor the infusion site during PADCEV administration and stop the infusion immediately for suspected extravasation. ( 5.6 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: PADCEV can cause fetal harm. Advise of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.7 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Skin Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including fatal cases of SJS or TEN occurred in patients treated with PADCEV. SJS and TEN occurred predominantly during the first cycle of treatment but may occur later. Skin reactions occurred in 70% (all grades) of the 564 patients treated with PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab in clinical trials. When PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab, the incidence of skin reactions, including severe events, occurred at a higher rate compared to PADCEV as a single agent. The majority of the skin reactions that occurred with combination therapy included maculo-papular rash, macular rash and papular rash. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 17% of patients (Grade 3: 16%, Grade 4: 1%), including maculo-papular rash, bullous dermatitis, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pemphigoid, rash, erythematous rash, macular rash, and papular rash. A fatal reaction of bullous dermatitis occurred in one patient (0.2%). The median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 1.7 months (range: 0.1 to 17.2 months). Skin reactions led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 6% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Of the patients who experienced a skin reaction and had data regarding resolution (N = 391), 59% had complete resolution and 41% had residual skin reactions at their last evaluation. Of the patients with residual skin reactions at last evaluation, 27% (43/159) had Grade ≥2 skin reactions. Skin reactions occurred in 58% (all grades) of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials. Twenty-three percent (23%) of patients had maculo-papular rash and 34% had pruritus. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 14% of patients, including maculo-papular rash, erythematous rash, rash or drug eruption, symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), bullous dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. The median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.6 months (range: 0.1 to 8 months). Among patients experiencing a skin reaction leading to dose interruption who then restarted PADCEV (n=75), 24% of patients restarting at the same dose and 24% of patients restarting at a reduced dose experienced recurrent severe skin reactions. Skin reactions led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 3.1% of patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Of the patients who experienced a skin reaction and had data regarding resolution (N =328), 58% had complete resolution and 42% had residual skin reactions at their last evaluation. Of the patients with residual skin reactions at last evaluation, 39% (53/137) had Grade ≥2 skin reactions. Monitor patients closely throughout treatment for skin reactions. Consider topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, as clinically indicated. For persistent or recurrent Grade 2 skin reactions, consider withholding PADCEV until Grade ≤1. Withhold PADCEV and refer for specialized care for suspected SJS, TEN or for Grade 3 skin reactions. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients with confirmed SJS or TEN; or Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.2 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including fatal events, occurred in patients with and without pre-existing diabetes mellitus, treated with PADCEV. Patients with baseline hemoglobin A1C ≥8% were excluded from clinical trials. In clinical trials of PADCEV as a single agent, 17% of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV developed hyperglycemia of any grade; 7% of patients developed Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia (Grade 3: 6.5%, Grade 4: 0.6%). Fatal events of hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in one patient each (0.1%). The incidence of Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in patients with higher baseline A1C. The median time to onset of hyperglycemia was 0.5 months (range: 0 to 20 months). Hyperglycemia led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 0.7% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Five percent (5%) of patients required initiation of insulin therapy for treatment of hyperglycemia. Of the patients who initiated insulin therapy for treatment of hyperglycemia, 66% (23/35) discontinued insulin by the time of last evaluation. Closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. If blood glucose is elevated (>250 mg/dL), withhold PADCEV [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.3 Pneumonitis/Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Severe, life-threatening or fatal pneumonitis/ILD occurred in patients treated with PADCEV. When PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab, 10% of the 564 patients treated with combination therapy had pneumonitis/ILD of any grade and 4% had Grade 3-4. A fatal event of pneumonitis/ILD occurred in two patients (0.4%). The incidence of pneumonitis/ILD, including severe events, occurred at a higher rate when PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab compared to PADCEV as a single agent. The median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis/ILD was 4 months (range: 0.3 to 26 months). In clinical trials of PADCEV as a single agent, 3% of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV had pneumonitis/ILD of any grade and 0.8% had Grade 3-4. The median time to onset of any grade pneumonitis/ILD was 2.9 months (range: 0.6 to 6 months). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms indicative of pneumonitis/ILD such as hypoxia, cough, dyspnea or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Evaluate and exclude infectious, neoplastic and other causes for such signs and symptoms through appropriate investigations. Withhold PADCEV for patients who develop Grade 2 pneumonitis/ILD and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis/ILD [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.4 Peripheral Neuropathy When PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab, 67% of the 564 patients treated with combination therapy had peripheral neuropathy of any grade, 36% had Grade 2 neuropathy, and 7% had Grade 3 neuropathy. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy occurred at a higher rate when PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab compared to PADCEV as a single agent. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy was 6 months (range: 0.3 to 25 months) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Of the patients who experienced neuropathy and had data regarding resolution (N = 373), 13% had complete resolution, and 87% of patients had residual neuropathy at last evaluation. Of the patients with residual neuropathy at last evaluation, 45% (146/326) had Grade ≥2 neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 53% of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials including 38% with sensory neuropathy, 8% with muscular weakness and 7% with motor neuropathy. Thirty percent of patients experienced Grade 2 reactions and 5% experienced Grade 3-4 reactions. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in patients treated with PADCEV with or without preexisting peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy was 4.9 months (range: 0.1 to 20 months). Neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 6% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Of the patients who experienced neuropathy who had data regarding resolution (N = 296), 11% had complete resolution, and 89% had residual neuropathy at the time of their last evaluation. Of the patients with residual neuropathy at last evaluation, 50% (132/262) had Grade ≥2 neuropathy. Monitor patients for symptoms of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when peripheral neuropathy occurs. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients who develop Grade > 3 peripheral neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.5 Ocular Disorders Ocular disorders were reported in 40% of the 384 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials in which ophthalmologic exams were scheduled. The majority of these events involved the cornea and included events associated with dry eye such as keratitis, blurred vision, increased lacrimation, conjunctivitis, limbal stem cell deficiency, and keratopathy. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 30 % of patients, and blurred vision occurred in 10 % of patients, during treatment with PADCEV. The median time to onset to symptomatic ocular disorder was 1.7 months (range: 0 to 30.6 months). Monitor patients for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for prophylaxis of dry eyes and ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms occur or do not resolve. Consider treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids, if indicated after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV for symptomatic ocular disorders. 5.6 Infusion Site Extravasation Skin and soft tissue reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed after administration of PADCEV. Of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials , 1 % of patients experienced skin and soft tissue reactions, including 0.3% who experienced Grade 3-4 reactions. Reactions may be delayed. Erythema, swelling, increased temperature, and pain worsened until 2-7 days after extravasation and resolved within 1-4 weeks of peak. Two patients (0.3%) developed extravasation reactions with secondary cellulitis, bullae, or exfoliation. Ensure adequate venous access prior to starting PADCEV and monitor for possible extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion and monitor for adverse reactions. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal lethality, structural malformations and skeletal anomalies at maternal exposures similar to the clinical exposures at the recommended human dose of 1.25 mg/kg. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 2 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] ."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no available human data on PADCEV use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In an animal reproduction study, administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal lethality, structural malformations and skeletal anomalies at maternal exposures similar to the exposures at the recommended human dose of 1.25 mg/kg (see Data) . Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat pilot embryo-fetal development study, administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv on gestation day 6 and 13 during the period of organogenesis resulted in a complete litter loss in all pregnant rats at the maternally toxic dose of 5 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the exposure at the recommended human dose). A dose of 2 mg/kg (similar to the exposure at the recommended human dose) resulted in maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal lethality and structural malformations that included gastroschisis, malrotated hindlimb, absent forepaw, malpositioned internal organs and fused cervical arch. Additionally, skeletal anomalies (asymmetric, fused, incompletely ossified, and misshapen sternebrae, misshapen cervical arch, and unilateral ossification of the thoracic centra) and decreased fetal weight were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with PADCEV and for 3 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating PADCEV treatment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Females PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 2 months after the last dose. Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility Females Based on findings in animal studies with MMAE-containing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), PADCEV may impair female fertility. The effect on fertility is reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Males Based on findings from animal studies, PADCEV may impair male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of PADCEV in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 564 patients treated with PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab, 44% (n=247) were 65-74 years and 26% (n=144) were 75 years or older. Of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials, 39% (n=282) were 65-74 years and 24% (n=170) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age or older and younger patients. Patients 75 years of age or older treated with PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab experienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. The incidence of fatal adverse reactions was 4% in patients younger than 75 and 7% in patients 75 years or older. Patients 75 years of age or older treated with PADCEV as a single agent experienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. The incidence of fatal adverse reactions was 6% in patients younger than 75 years, and 11% in patients 75 years or older. No significant difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of PADCEV between patients 65 years and older and younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Avoid the use of PADCEV in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN and AST any). PADCEV has only been studied in a limited number of patients with moderate hepatic impairment (n=3) and has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In another ADC that contains MMAE, the frequency of ≥ Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function."

        "8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 564 patients treated with PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab, 44% (n=247) were 65-74 years and 26% (n=144) were 75 years or older. Of the 720 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials, 39% (n=282) were 65-74 years and 24% (n=170) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age or older and younger patients. Patients 75 years of age or older treated with PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab experienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. The incidence of fatal adverse reactions was 4% in patients younger than 75 and 7% in patients 75 years or older. Patients 75 years of age or older treated with PADCEV as a single agent experienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. The incidence of fatal adverse reactions was 6% in patients younger than 75 years, and 11% in patients 75 years or older. No significant difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of PADCEV between patients 65 years and older and younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

        "11 DESCRIPTION Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is a Nectin-4 directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a fully human anti-Nectin-4 IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody (AGS-22C3) conjugated to the small molecule microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable maleimidocaproyl valine-citrulline (vc) linker (SGD-1006). Conjugation takes place on cysteine residues that comprise the interchain disulfide bonds of the antibody to yield a product with a drug-to-antibody ratio of approximately 3.8:1. The molecular weight is approximately 152 kDa. Figure 1. Structural Formula Approximately 4 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) for injection is provided as a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white lyophilized powder in single-dose vials for intravenous use. PADCEV is supplied as a 20 mg per vial and a 30 mg per vial and requires reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, (2.3 mL and 3.3 mL, respectively) resulting in a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution with a final concentration of 10 mg/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. After reconstitution, each vial allows the withdrawal of 2 mL (20 mg) and 3 mL (30 mg). Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 10 mg of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, histidine (1.4 mg), histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (2.31 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.2 mg) and trehalose dihydrate (55 mg) with a pH of 6.0.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is an ADC. The antibody is a human IgG1 kappa directed against Nectin-4, an adhesion protein located on the surface of cells. The small molecule, MMAE, is a microtubule-disrupting agent, attached to the antibody via a protease-cleavable linker. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is due to the binding of the ADC to Nectin-4-expressing cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-Nectin-4 complex, and the release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. Release of MMAE disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The combination of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv with a PD-1 blocking antibody resulted in up-regulation of immune function and increased anti-tumor activity in syngeneic mouse tumor models expressing Nectin-4. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In an exposure-response analysis for safety, higher enfortumab vedotin-ejfv exposure was associated with higher incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy, Grade ≥3 hyperglycemia). The exposure-response relationship for efficacy has not been fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology At the recommended dose, PADCEV had no large QTc prolongation (>20 msec). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv (ADC) pharmacokinetics were characterized after single and multiple doses in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors. The pharmacokinetics of the ADC and unconjugated MMAE were consistent when assessed following PADCEV administration as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab after 1 treatment cycle. The exposure parameters of the ADC and unconjugated MMAE (the cytotoxic component of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) are summarized in Table 13 below. Peak ADC concentrations were observed near the end of intravenous infusion while peak unconjugated MMAE concentrations were observed approximately 2 days after PADCEV dosing. Minimal accumulation of the ADC and unconjugated MMAE was observed following repeat administration of PADCEV in patients. Steady-state concentrations of the ADC were reached after 1 treatment cycle for the ADC as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. Table 13. Exposure parameters of the ADC and unconjugated MMAE after first treatment cycle of 1.25 mg/kg of PADCEV dose of Days 1, 8 and 15 C max = maximum concentration, AUC 0-28d = area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 28 days, C trough,0-28d = pre-dose concentration on day 28 ADC Mean (± SD) Unconjugated MMAE Mean (± SD) C max 28 (6.1) µg/mL 5.5 (3.0) ng/mL AUC 0-28d 110 (26) µg∙d/mL 85 (50) ng∙d/mL C trough,0-28d 0.31 (0.18) µg/mL 0.81 (0.88) ng/mL Distribution The estimated mean steady-state volume of distribution of the ADC was 12.8 L following administration of PADCEV. In vitro, plasma protein binding of unconjugated MMAE ranged from 68% to 82%. Elimination The ADC and unconjugated MMAE exhibited multi-exponential declines with an elimination half-life of 3.6 days and 2.6 days, respectively. The mean clearance (CL) of the ADC and unconjugated MMAE was 0.11 L/h and 2.11 L/h, respectively. Elimination of unconjugated MMAE appeared to be limited by its rate of release from the ADC. Metabolism Catabolism of the ADC has not been studied in humans; however, it is expected to undergo catabolism to small peptides, amino acids, unconjugated MMAE, and unconjugated MMAE-related catabolites. The ADC releases MMAE via proteolytic cleavage, and unconjugated MMAE is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro . Excretion The excretion of the ADC is not fully characterized. Following a single-dose of another ADC that contains unconjugated MMAE, 17% of the total unconjugated MMAE administered was recovered in feces and 6% in urine over a 1-week period, primarily as unchanged form. A similar excretion profile of unconjugated MMAE is expected after PADCEV administration. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of the ADC or unconjugated MMAE were identified based on age (24 to 90 years), sex, race (Caucasian, Asian, or Black), renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin of 1 to 1.5 × ULN and AST any, or total bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN). The effect of end stage renal disease with or without dialysis and moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN and AST any) on the pharmacokinetics of the ADC or unconjugated MMAE is unknown. Drug Interaction Trials No clinical trials evaluating the drug-drug interaction potential of the ADC have been conducted. Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling Predictions: Dual P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor: Concomitant use of PADCEV with ketoconazole (a dual P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) is predicted to increase unconjugated MMAE C max by 15% and AUC by 38%. Dual P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducer: Concomitant use of PADCEV with rifampin (a dual P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducer) is predicted to decrease unconjugated MMAE C max by 28% and AUC by 53%. Sensitive CYP3A substrates: Concomitant use of PADCEV is predicted not to affect exposure to midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate). In Vitro Studies Transporter Systems: MMAE is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is not an inhibitor of P-gp. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of PADCEV or of other enfortumab vedotin products. In the 0.3-to-55.7-month treatment periods with ADA sampling in eight clinical studies of PADCEV 1.25 mg/kg as a single agent on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle and in combination with pembrolizumab on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , the incidence of anti-enfortumab vedotin-ejfv antibody formation was 3.6% (22 of 617 patients who were tested for ADA) for PADCEV as a single agent and 3.0% (14 of 466 patients who were tested for ADA) for PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab. Because of the low occurrence of ADA, the effect of the ADA on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and/or effectiveness of PADCEV is unknown."

Fertility studies with enfortumab vedotin-ejfv or MMAE have not been conducted. However, results of repeat-dose toxicity studies indicate the potential for enfortumab vedotin-ejfv to impair female and male reproductive function and fertility. In repeat-dose toxicology studies conducted in rats for up to 13 weeks, doses ≥2 mg/kg enfortumab vedotin-ejfv (at exposures similar to the exposures at the recommended human dose) resulted in decreases in testes and epididymis weights, seminiferous tubule degeneration, spermatid/spermatocyte depletion in the testes and cell debris, sperm granuloma and hypospermia/abnormal spermatids in the epididymis. Findings in the testes and epididymis did not reverse by the end of the recovery period. MMAE-containing ADCs have been associated with adverse ovarian effects when administered to sexually immature animals. Adverse effects included decrease in, or absence of, secondary and tertiary ovarian follicles after weekly administration to cynomolgus monkeys in studies of 4-week duration. These effects showed a trend towards recovery 6 weeks after the end of dosing; no changes were observed in primordial follicles."

Patients with active CNS metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy Grade ≥2, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either: • PADCEV 1.25 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle approximately 30 minutes after PADCEV. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, pembrolizumab was continued for up to 2 years. • Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle with cisplatin 70 mg/m 2 or carboplatin (AUC = 4.5 or 5) on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 6 cycles. Randomization was stratified by cisplatin eligibility, PD-L1 expression, and presence of liver metastases. The median age was 69 years (range: 22 to 91); 77% were male; 67% were White, 22% were Asian, 1% were Black or African American, and 10% were unknown or other; 12% were Hispanic or Latino. Patients had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (49%), 1 (47%) or 2 (3%). Forty-seven percent of patients had a documented baseline HbA1c of <5.7%. At baseline, 95% of patients had metastatic urothelial cancer, including 72% with visceral and 22% with liver metastases, and 5% had locally advanced urothelial cancer. Eighty-five percent of patients had urothelial carcinoma (UC) histology including 6% with UC mixed squamous differentiation and 2% with UC mixed other histologic variants. Forty-six percent of patients were considered cisplatin-ineligible and 54% were considered cisplatin-eligible at time of randomization. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures included objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by BICR. The trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS, PFS, and ORR for patients randomized to PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab as compared to platinum-based chemotherapy. Efficacy results were consistent across all stratified patient subgroups. Table 14 and Figures 2-3 summarize the efficacy results for EV-302. Table 14.

Patients with active CNS metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy Grade ≥2, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms were excluded from participating in the trial. Patients in the dose escalation cohort (n=5), Cohort A (n=40), and Cohort K (n=76) received PADCEV 1.25 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg as an IV infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle approximately 30 minutes after PADCEV. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 121 patients received PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab. The median age was 71 years (range: 51 to 91); 74% were male; 85% were White, 5% were Black, 4% were Asian and 6% were other, unknown or not reported. Ten percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino. Forty-five percent of patients had an ECOG performance status of 1 and 15% had an ECOG performance status of 2. Forty-seven percent of patients had a documented baseline HbA1c of <5.7%.

Eighty-four percent of patients had visceral metastasis at baseline including 22% with liver metastases. Thirty-nine percent of patients had transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) histology; 13% had TCC with squamous differentiation and 48% had TCC with other histologic variants. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1. The median follow-up time for the dose escalation cohort + Cohort A was 44.7 months (range: 0.7 to 52.4) and for Cohort K was 14.8 months (range: 0.6 to 26.2). Efficacy results are presented in Table 15 below. Table 15. Efficacy Results in EV-103, Combined Dose Escalation Cohort, Cohort A, and Cohort K PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab n=121 Confirmed ORR (95% CI) 68% (58.7, 76.0) Complete response rate 12% Partial response rate 55% The median duration of response for the dose escalation cohort + Cohort A was 22.1 months (range: 1.0+ to 46.3+) and for Cohort K was not reached (range: 1.2 to 24.1+). Previously Treated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer EV-301 The efficacy of PADCEV as a single agent was evaluated in EV-301 (NCT03474107), an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial that enrolled 608 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either PADCEV 1.25 mg/kg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), region of world (Western Europe vs US vs Rest of World), and presence of liver metastasis. Patients were excluded if they had active central nervous system (CNS) metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy ≥Grade 2, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms. The median age was 68 years (range: 30 to 88 years) and 77% were male. Racial demographics were reported as White (52%), Asian (33%), Black (0.7%), Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (0.2%) or not reported (15%). Nine percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino. All patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (40%) or 1 (60%). Thirty-four percent of patients had tumors located in the upper tract that included the renal pelvis and ureter. Eighty percent of patients had visceral metastases including 31% with liver metastases. Seventy-six percent of patients had pure TCC histology; 14% had TCC with other histologic variants; and 10% had other tumor histologies including adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range 1 to ≥3). Sixty-three percent of patients received prior cisplatin-based regimens, 26% received prior carboplatin-based regimens, and an additional 11% received both cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens. Patients on the control arm received docetaxel (38%), paclitaxel (36%) or vinflunine (25%). The major efficacy outcome measures were OS, PFS, and ORR assessed by investigator using RECIST v1.1. Efficacy results were consistent across all stratified patient subgroups. Table 16 and Figures 4-5 summarize the efficacy results for EV-301. Table 16.

Kaplan Meier Plot of Overall Survival, EV-301 Figure 5. Kaplan Meier Plot of Progression Free Survival, EV-301 EV-201, Cohort 1 The efficacy of PADCEV as a single agent was also investigated in Cohort 1 of EV-201 (NCT03219333), a single-arm, multi-cohort, multicenter trial that enrolled 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were excluded if they had active central nervous system (CNS) metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy ≥Grade 2, heart failure, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms. PADCEV was administered at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg, as an intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The median age was 69 years (range: 40 to 84 years) and 70% were male. Racial demographics were reported as White (85%), Asian (9%), Black (2%), Other (0.8%) or not reported (4%). Four percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino. All patients had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (32%) or 1 (68%). Ninety percent of patients had visceral metastases including 40% with liver metastases. Approximately two-thirds (67%) of patients had pure transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) histology; 33% had TCC with other histologic variants. The median number of prior systemic therapies was 3 (range: 1 to 6). Sixty-six percent of patients received prior cisplatin-based regimens, 26% received prior carboplatin-based regimens, and an additional 8% received both cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1. Efficacy results are presented in Table 17 . Table 17.

Duration of Response, months (95% CI) 7.6 (6.3, NE) Previously Treated Cisplatin Ineligible Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer EV-201, Cohort 2 The efficacy of PADCEV as a single agent was also evaluated in Cohort 2 of EV-201, a single-arm, multi-cohort, multicenter trial in 89 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and were cisplatin ineligible and did not receive platinum in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. Patients were excluded if they had active CNS metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy ≥Grade 2, heart failure, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms. PADCEV was administered at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg, as an intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The median age was 75 years (range: 49 to 90 years), 74% were male. Racial demographics were reported as White (70%), Asian (22%) or not reported (8%). One percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino. Patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (42%), 1 (46%) and 2 (12%). Forty-three percent of patients had tumors located in the upper tract that included the renal pelvis and ureter. Seventy-nine percent of patients had visceral metastases and 24% had liver metastases. Reasons for cisplatin ineligibility included: 66% with baseline creatinine clearance of 30 – 59 mL/min, 7% with ECOG PS of 2, 15% with Grade 2 or greater hearing loss, and 12% with more than one cisplatin-ineligibility criteria. Seventy percent of patients had TCC histology; 13% had TCC with squamous differentiation and 17% had TCC with other histologic variants. The median number of prior systemic therapies was 1 (range: 1 to 4). Efficacy results are presented in Table 18 below. Table 18.

        "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Skin Reactions Inform patients that severe skin reactions including SJS and TEN with fatal outcomes have occurred after administration of PADCEV, predominantly during the first cycle of treatment but may occur later. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they develop new target lesions, progressively worsening skin reactions, severe blistering or peeling of the skin [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Hyperglycemia Inform patients about the risk of hyperglycemia and how to recognize associated symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Pneumonitis/ILD Advise patients to immediately report new or worsening respiratory symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Peripheral Neuropathy Inform patients to report to their healthcare provider any numbness and tingling of the hands or feet or muscle weakness [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Ocular disorders Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience any visual changes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . In order to prevent or treat dry eyes, advise patients to use artificial tear substitutes. Infusion Site Extravasation Inform patients that infusion site reactions have occurred after administration of PADCEV. These reactions generally occurred immediately after administration but, in some instances, had a delayed onset (e.g., 24 hours). Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they experience an infusion site reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus.
