Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Prior to administration, the PADCEV vial is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI). The reconstituted solution is subsequently diluted in an intravenous infusion bag containing either 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP. Reconstitution in Single-dose Vial 1. Follow procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs. 2. Use appropriate aseptic technique for reconstitution and preparation of dosing solutions. 3. Calculate the recommended dose based on the patient’s weight to determine the number and strength (20 mg or 30 mg) of vials needed. 4. Reconstitute each vial as follows and, if possible, direct the stream of SWFI along the walls of the vial and not directly onto the lyophilized powder: a. 20 mg vial: Add 2.3 mL of SWFI, resulting in 10 mg/mL PADCEV. b. 30 mg vial: Add 3.3 mL of SWFI, resulting in 10 mg/mL PADCEV. 5. Slowly swirl each vial until the contents are completely dissolved. Allow the reconstituted vial(s) to settle for at least 1 minute until the bubbles are gone. DO NOT SHAKE THE VIAL. Do not expose to direct sunlight. 6. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The reconstituted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to light yellow and free of visible particles. Discard any vial with visible particles or discoloration. 7. Based upon the calculated dose amount, the reconstituted solution from the vial(s) should be added to the infusion bag immediately. This product does not contain a preservative. If not used immediately, reconstituted vials may be stored for up to 24 hours in refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36 °F to 46 °F). DO NOT FREEZE. Discard unused vials with reconstituted solution beyond the recommended storage time. Dilution in Infusion Bag 8. Withdraw the calculated dose amount of reconstituted solution from the vial(s) and transfer into an infusion bag. 9. Dilute PADCEV with either 5% Dextrose Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. The infusion bag size should allow enough diluent to achieve a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL PADCEV. 10. Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion. DO NOT SHAKE THE BAG. Do not expose to direct sunlight. 11. Visually inspect the infusion bag for any particulate matter or discoloration prior to use. The reconstituted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to light yellow and free of visible particles. DO NOT USE the infusion bag if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. 12. Discard any unused portion left in the single-dose vials. Administration 13. Immediately administer the infusion over 30 minutes through an intravenous line. 14. If the infusion is not administered immediately, the prepared infusion bag should not be stored longer than 8 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36 °F to 46 °F). DO NOT FREEZE. DO NOT administer PADCEV as an intravenous push or bolus. DO NOT mix PADCEV with, or administer as an infusion with, other medicinal products."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hyperglycemia: Diabetic ketoacidosis may occur in patients with and without preexisting diabetes mellitus, which may be fatal. Closely /monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. Withhold PADCEV if blood glucose is >250 mg/dL. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) • Pneumonitis/Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): Severe, life-threatening or fatal pneumonitis/ILD may occur. Withhold PADCEV for Grade 2 pneumonitis/ILD and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue PADCEV for Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis/ILD. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) • Peripheral Neuropathy: Monitor patients for new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of PADCEV. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) • Ocular Disorders: Ocular disorders, including vision changes, may occur. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of ocular disorders. Consider prophylactic artificial tears for dry eyes and treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when symptomatic ocular disorders occur. ( 5.5 ) • Infusion Site Extravasation: Ensure adequate venous access prior to administration. Monitor the infusion site during PADCEV administration and stop the infusion immediately for suspected extravasation. ( 5.6 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: PADCEV can cause fetal harm. Advise of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.7 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Skin Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including fatal cases of SJS or TEN occurred in patients treated with PADCEV. SJS and TEN occurred predominantly during the first cycle of treatment but may occur later. Skin reactions occurred in 56% (all grades) of the 753 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials. Twenty-four percent (24%) of patients had maculo-papular rash and 33% had pruritus. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 12% of patients, including maculo-papular rash, erythematous rash, rash or drug eruption, symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE), bullous dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. The median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 0.7 months (range: 0.1 to 6 months). Among patients experiencing a skin reaction leading to dose interruption who then restarted PADCEV (n=59), 24% of patients restarting at the same dose and 16% of patients restarting at a reduced dose experienced recurrent severe skin reactions. Skin reactions led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 2.6% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. When PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab, the incidence of skin reactions, including severe events, occurred at a higher rate. Skin reactions occurred in 72% (all grades) of the 121 patients treated with PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab in clinical trials. The majority of the skin reactions that occurred with combination therapy included maculo-papular rash, macular rash and papular rash. Grade 3-4 skin reactions occurred in 20% of patients (Grade 3: 19%, Grade 4: 0.8%), including maculo-papular rash, bullous dermatitis, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pemphigoid, rash, erythematous rash, macular rash, and papular rash. A fatal reaction of bullous dermatitis occurred in one patient (0.8%). The median time to onset of severe skin reactions was 2.6 months (range: 0.3 to 16 months). Skin reactions led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 6% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Monitor patients closely throughout treatment for skin reactions. Consider topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, as clinically indicated. For persistent or recurrent Grade 2 skin reactions, consider withholding PADCEV until Grade ≤1. Withhold PADCEV and refer for specialized care for suspected SJS, TEN or for Grade 3 skin reactions. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients with confirmed SJS or TEN; or Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 skin reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.2 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including fatal events, occurred in patients with and without pre-existing diabetes mellitus, treated with PADCEV. Patients with baseline hemoglobin A1C ≥8% were excluded from clinical trials. In clinical trials of PADCEV as a single agent, 14% of the 753 patients treated with PADCEV developed hyperglycemia; 7% of patients developed Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia. Fatal events of hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in one patient each (0.1%). The incidence of Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia increased consistently in patients with higher body mass index and in patients with higher baseline A1C. Five percent (5%) of patients required initiation of insulin therapy for treatment of hyperglycemia. The median time to onset of hyperglycemia was 0.6 months (range: 0.1 to 20 months). Hyperglycemia led to discontinuation of PADCEV in 0.4% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with, or at risk for, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. If blood glucose is elevated (>250 mg/dL), withhold PADCEV [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.3 Pneumonitis/Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Severe, life-threatening or fatal pneumonitis/ILD occurred in patients treated with PADCEV. In clinical trials of PADCEV as a single agent, 2.9% of the 753 patients treated with PADCEV had pneumonitis/ILD of any grade and 0.8% had Grade 3-4. The median time to onset of pneumonitis/ILD was 2.7 months (range: 0.6 to 6 months). The incidence of pneumonitis/ILD, including severe events occurred at a higher rate when PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab. When PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab, 9% of the 121 patients treated with combination therapy had pneumonitis/ILD of any grade and 3.3% had Grade 3. A fatal event of pneumonitis occurred in one patient (0.8%). The median time to onset of pneumonitis/ILD was 6 months (range: 0.6 to 26 months). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms indicative of pneumonitis/ILD such as hypoxia, cough, dyspnea or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Evaluate and exclude infectious, neoplastic and other causes for such signs and symptoms through appropriate investigations. Withhold PADCEV for patients who develop Grade 2 pneumonitis/ILD and consider dose reduction. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis/ILD [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.4 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 53% of the 753 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials including 40% with sensory neuropathy, 7% with muscular weakness and 7% with motor neuropathy. Thirty percent of patients experienced Grade 2 reactions and 5% experienced Grade 3-4 reactions. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in patients treated with PADCEV with or without preexisting peripheral neuropathy. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy was 4.9 months (range: 0.1 to 20 months). Neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 7% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Of the patients who experienced neuropathy who had data regarding resolution (N = 319) 14% had complete resolution, 46% had partial improvement, and 40% had no improvement at the time of their last evaluation. Of the 86% of patients with residual neuropathy at last evaluation, 51% had Grade 2 or greater neuropathy at the time of their last evaluation. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy occurred at a higher rate when PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab. When PADCEV was given in combination with pembrolizumab, 65% of the 121 patients treated with combination therapy had peripheral neuropathy of any grade, 45% had Grade 2 neuropathy, and 3.3% had Grade 3 neuropathy. The median time to onset of Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy was 6 months (range: 0.3 to 25 months). Monitor patients for symptoms of new or worsening peripheral neuropathy and consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV when peripheral neuropathy occurs. Permanently discontinue PADCEV in patients who develop Grade > 3 peripheral neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.5 Ocular Disorders Ocular disorders were reported in 40% of the 384 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials in which ophthalmologic exams were scheduled. The majority of these events involved the cornea and included events associated with dry eye such as keratitis, blurred vision, increased lacrimation, conjunctivitis, limbal stem cell deficiency, and keratopathy. Dry eye symptoms occurred in 34% of patients, and blurred vision occurred in 13% of patients, during treatment with PADCEV. The median time to onset to symptomatic ocular disorder was 1.6 months (range: 0 to 19 months). Monitor patients for ocular disorders. Consider artificial tears for prophylaxis of dry eyes and ophthalmologic evaluation if ocular symptoms occur or do not resolve. Consider treatment with ophthalmic topical steroids, if indicated after an ophthalmic exam. Consider dose interruption or dose reduction of PADCEV for symptomatic ocular disorders. 5.6 Infusion Site Extravasation Skin and soft tissue reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed after administration of PADCEV. Of the 753 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials, 1.5% of patients experienced skin and soft tissue reactions, including 0.3% who experienced Grade 3-4 reactions. Reactions may be delayed. Erythema, swelling, increased temperature, and pain worsened until 2-7 days after extravasation and resolved within 1-4 weeks of peak. Two patients (0.3%) developed extravasation reactions with secondary cellulitis, bullae, or exfoliation. Ensure adequate venous access prior to starting PADCEV and monitor for possible extravasation during administration. If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion and monitor for adverse reactions . 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal lethality, structural malformations and skeletal anomalies at maternal exposures similar to the clinical exposures at the recommended human dose of 1.25 mg/kg. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 2 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] ."

( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] . There are no available human data on PADCEV use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In an animal reproduction study, administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal lethality, structural malformations and skeletal anomalies at maternal exposures similar to the exposures at the recommended human dose of 1.25 mg/kg (see Data) . Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat pilot embryo-fetal development study, administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv on gestation day 6 and 13 during the period of organogenesis resulted in a complete litter loss in all pregnant rats at the maternally toxic dose of 5 mg/kg (approximately 3 times the exposure at the recommended human dose). A dose of 2 mg/kg (similar to the exposure at the recommended human dose) resulted in maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal lethality and structural malformations that included gastroschisis, malrotated hindlimb, absent forepaw, malpositioned internal organs and fused cervical arch. Additionally, skeletal anomalies (asymmetric, fused, incompletely ossified, and misshapen sternebrae, misshapen cervical arch, and unilateral ossification of the thoracic centra) and decreased fetal weight were observed. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with PADCEV and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating PADCEV treatment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Females PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 2 months after the last dose. Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility Males Based on findings from animal studies, PADCEV may impair male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of PADCEV in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 753 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials, 40% (n=300) were 65-74 years and 27% (n=202) were 75 years or older. Of the 121 patients treated with PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab, 43% (n=52) were 65-74 years and 33% (n=40) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age or older and younger patients. Patients 65 years of age or older treated with PADCEV as a single agent experienced a higher incidence of serious and fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. In clinical trials, the incidence of serious adverse reactions was 42% in patients younger than 65 years, 45% in patients ages 65-74 years, and 49% in patients 75 years or older. The incidence of fatal adverse reactions was 4.4% in patients younger than 65 years, 6% in patients ages 65-74 years, and 11% in patients 75 years or older. The incidence of treatment discontinuations of PADCEV due to adverse reactions was 17% in patients younger than 65 years, 20% in patients ages 65-74 years, and 26% in patients 75 years or older. There were an insufficient number of patients treated with PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab in clinical trials to accurately characterize safety by age. No significant difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of PADCEV between patients 65 years and older and younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Avoid the use of PADCEV in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN and AST any). PADCEV has only been studied in a limited number of patients with moderate hepatic impairment (n=3) and has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In another ADC that contains MMAE, the frequency of ≥ Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. No adjustment in the starting dose is required when administering PADCEV to patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 × ULN and AST any, or total bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN). 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (CrCL >60-90 mL/min), moderate (CrCL 30-60 mL/min) or severe (CrCL <30 mL/min) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

        "11 DESCRIPTION Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is a Nectin-4 directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a fully human anti-Nectin-4 IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody (AGS-22C3) conjugated to the small molecule microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable maleimidocaproyl valine-citrulline (vc) linker (SGD-1006). Conjugation takes place on cysteine residues that comprise the interchain disulfide bonds of the antibody to yield a product with a drug-to-antibody ratio of approximately 3.8:1. The molecular weight is approximately 152 kDa. Figure 1. Structural Formula Approximately 4 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) for injection is provided as a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white lyophilized powder in single-dose vials for intravenous use. PADCEV is supplied as a 20 mg per vial and a 30 mg per vial and requires reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, (2.3 mL and 3.3 mL, respectively) resulting in a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution with a final concentration of 10 mg/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. After reconstitution, each vial allows the withdrawal of 2 mL (20 mg) and 3 mL (30 mg). Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 10 mg of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, histidine (1.4 mg), histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (2.31 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.2 mg) and trehalose dihydrate (55 mg) with a pH of 6.0.

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is an ADC. The antibody is a human IgG1 directed against Nectin-4, an adhesion protein located on the surface of cells. The small molecule, MMAE, is a microtubule-disrupting agent, attached to the antibody via a protease-cleavable linker. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is due to the binding of the ADC to Nectin-4-expressing cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-Nectin-4 complex, and the release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. Release of MMAE disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The combination of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv with a PD-1 blocking antibody resulted in up-regulation of immune function and increased anti-tumor activity in syngeneic mouse tumor models expressing Nectin-4. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In an exposure-response analysis, higher enfortumab vedotin-ejfv exposure was associated with higher incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy, Grade ≥3 hyperglycemia). The exposure-response relationship for efficacy has not been fully characterized. Cardiac Electrophysiology At the recommended dose, PADCEV had no large QTc prolongation (>20 msec). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Population pharmacokinetic analysis included data from 748 patients treated with PADCEV as a single agent in clinical trials. Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv pharmacokinetics were characterized after single and multiple doses in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors. The pharmacokinetics of ADC and unconjugated MMAE were consistent when assessed following PADCEV administration as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. The exposure parameters of ADC and unconjugated MMAE (the cytotoxic component of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) are summarized in Table 11 below. Peak ADC concentrations were observed near the end of intravenous infusion while peak unconjugated MMAE concentrations were observed approximately 2 days after enfortumab vedotin-ejfv dosing. Minimal accumulation of the ADC and unconjugated MMAE was observed following repeat administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv in patients. Steady-state concentrations of ADC and unconjugated MMAE were reached after 1 treatment cycle. Table 11. Exposure parameters of ADC and unconjugated MMAE after first treatment cycle of 1.25 mg/kg of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv dose of Days 1, 8 and 15 C max = maximum concentration, AUC 0-28d = area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 28 days, C trough,0-28d = pre-dose concentration on day 28 ADC Mean (± SD) Unconjugated MMAE Mean (± SD) C max 28 (6.1) µg/mL 5.5 (3.0) ng/mL AUC 0-28d 110 (26) µg∙d/mL 85 (50) ng∙d/mL C trough,0-28d 0.31 (0.18) µg/mL 0.81 (0.88) ng/mL Distribution The estimated mean steady-state volume of distribution of ADC was 12.8 liters following administration of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv. Plasma protein binding of unconjugated MMAE ranged from 68% to 82%, in vitro . Elimination ADC and unconjugated MMAE exhibited multi-exponential declines with an elimination half-life of 3.6 days and 2.6 days, respectively. The mean clearance (CL) of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv and unconjugated MMAE in patients was 0.11 L/h and 2.11 L/h, respectively, in patients. Elimination of unconjugated MMAE appeared to be limited by its rate of release from enfortumab vedotin-ejfv. Metabolism Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv catabolism has not been studied in humans; however, it is expected to undergo catabolism to small peptides, amino acids, unconjugated MMAE, and unconjugated MMAE-related catabolites. Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv releases unconjugated MMAE via proteolytic cleavage, and unconjugated MMAE is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro . Excretion The excretion of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is not fully characterized. Following a single-dose of another ADC that contains unconjugated MMAE, 17% of the total unconjugated MMAE administered was recovered in feces and 6% in urine over a 1-week period, primarily as unchanged drug. A similar excretion profile of unconjugated MMAE is expected after enfortumab vedotin-ejfv administration. Specific Populations Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv were observed based on age (24 to 90 years), sex, or race/ethnicity (Caucasian, Asian, Black, or others). Hepatic Impairment Based on population pharmacokinetics analysis, there was a 37% AUC 0-28d increase in unconjugated MMAE exposure observed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin of 1 to 1.5 × ULN and AST any, or total bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN, n=65) compared to normal hepatic function. Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv has only been studied in limited number of patients with moderate hepatic impairment and has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN and AST any) or liver transplantation on the pharmacokinetics of ADC or unconjugated MMAE is unknown. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv and unconjugated MMAE were evaluated after the administration of 1.25 mg/kg of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv to patients with mild (creatinine clearance; CrCL >60–90 mL/min; n=272), moderate (CrCL 30–60 mL/min; n=315) and severe (CrCL <30 mL/min; n=25) renal impairment. No significant differences in exposure (AUC) of ADC and unconjugated MMAE were observed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. The effect of end stage renal disease with or without dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of ADC or unconjugated MMAE is unknown. Drug Interaction Trials No clinical trials evaluating the drug-drug interaction potential of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv have been conducted. Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling Predictions: Dual P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor: Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv with ketoconazole (a dual P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) is predicted to increase unconjugated MMAE C max by 15% and AUC by 38%. Dual P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducer: Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv with rifampin (a dual P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducer) is predicted to decrease unconjugated MMAE C max by 28% and AUC by 53%. Sensitive CYP3A substrates: Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is predicted not to affect exposure to midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate). In Vitro Studies Transporter Systems: MMAE is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not an inhibitor of P-gp. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of PADCEV or of other enfortumab vedotin products. In the 0.3-to-52.1-month treatment periods with ADA sampling in five clinical studies of PADCEV 1.25 mg/kg as a single agent in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , the incidence of treatment emergent anti-enfortumab vedotin-ejfv antibody formation was 3.6% [23 of 640 total PADCEV-treated patients who were tested for ADA]. When PADCEV was administered in combination with pembrolizumab, the incidence of treatment emergent ADA against enfortumab vedotin-ejfv was 2.9% [3 of 105 total PADCEV-treated patients who were tested for ADA]. The incidence of treatment-emergent anti-enfortumab-ejfv antibody formation was consistent when assessed following PADCEV administration as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. Because of the low occurrence of ADA, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and/or effectiveness of PADCEV is unknown."

Following a single-dose of another ADC that contains unconjugated MMAE, 17% of the total unconjugated MMAE administered was recovered in feces and 6% in urine over a 1-week period, primarily as unchanged drug. A similar excretion profile of unconjugated MMAE is expected after enfortumab vedotin-ejfv administration. Specific Populations Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv were observed based on age (24 to 90 years), sex, or race/ethnicity (Caucasian, Asian, Black, or others). Hepatic Impairment Based on population pharmacokinetics analysis, there was a 37% AUC 0-28d increase in unconjugated MMAE exposure observed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin of 1 to 1.5 × ULN and AST any, or total bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN, n=65) compared to normal hepatic function. Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv has only been studied in limited number of patients with moderate hepatic impairment and has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN and AST any) or liver transplantation on the pharmacokinetics of ADC or unconjugated MMAE is unknown. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv and unconjugated MMAE were evaluated after the administration of 1.25 mg/kg of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv to patients with mild (creatinine clearance; CrCL >60–90 mL/min; n=272), moderate (CrCL 30–60 mL/min; n=315) and severe (CrCL <30 mL/min; n=25) renal impairment. No significant differences in exposure (AUC) of ADC and unconjugated MMAE were observed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. The effect of end stage renal disease with or without dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of ADC or unconjugated MMAE is unknown. Drug Interaction Trials No clinical trials evaluating the drug-drug interaction potential of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv have been conducted. Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling Predictions: Dual P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor: Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv with ketoconazole (a dual P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) is predicted to increase unconjugated MMAE C max by 15% and AUC by 38%. Dual P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducer: Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv with rifampin (a dual P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducer) is predicted to decrease unconjugated MMAE C max by 28% and AUC by 53%. Sensitive CYP3A substrates: Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is predicted not to affect exposure to midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate). In Vitro Studies Transporter Systems: MMAE is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not an inhibitor of P-gp."

MMAE was genotoxic in the rat bone marrow micronucleus study through an aneugenic mechanism. This effect is consistent with the pharmacological effect of MMAE as a microtubule-disrupting agent. MMAE was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or the L5178Y mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay. Fertility studies with enfortumab vedotin-ejfv or MMAE have not been conducted. However, results of repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats indicate the potential for enfortumab vedotin-ejfv to impair male reproductive function and fertility. In repeat-dose toxicology studies conducted in rats for up to 13 weeks, doses ≥2 mg/kg enfortumab vedotin-ejfv (at exposures similar to the exposures at the recommended human dose) resulted in decreases in testes and epididymis weights, seminiferous tubule degeneration, spermatid/spermatocyte depletion in the testes and cell debris, sperm granuloma and hypospermia/abnormal spermatids in the epididymis. Findings in the testes and epididymis did not reverse by the end of the recovery period."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Metastatic Urothelial Cancer Previously Treated Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma EV-301 The efficacy of PADCEV as a single agent was evaluated in EV-301 (NCT03474107), an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial that enrolled 608 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either PADCEV 1.25 mg/kg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), region of world (Western Europe vs US vs Rest of World), and presence of liver metastasis. Patients were excluded if they had active central nervous system (CNS) metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy ≥Grade 2, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms. The median age was 68 years (range: 30 to 88 years) and 77% were male. Racial demographics were reported as White (52%), Asian (33%), Black (0.7%), Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (0.2%) or not reported (15%). Nine percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino. All patients had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (40%) or 1 (60%). Thirty-four percent of patients had tumors located in the upper tract that included the renal pelvis and ureter. Eighty percent of patients had visceral metastases including 31% with liver metastases. Seventy-six percent of patients had pure transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) histology; 14% had TCC with other histologic variants; and 10% had other tumor histologies including adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range 1 to ≥3). Sixty-three percent of patients received prior cisplatin-based regimens, 26% received prior carboplatin-based regimens, and an additional 11% received both cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens. Patients on the control arm received docetaxel (38%), paclitaxel (36%) or vinflunine (25%). The major efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR) assessed by investigator using RECIST v1.1. Efficacy results were consistent across all stratified patient subgroups. Table 12 and Figures 2 - 3 summarize the efficacy results for EV-301. Table 12.

Kaplan Meier Plot of Overall Survival Figure 3. Kaplan Meier Plot of Progression Free Survival EV-201, Cohort 1 The efficacy of PADCEV as a single agent was also investigated in Cohort 1 of EV-201 (NCT03219333), a single-arm, multi-cohort, multicenter trial that enrolled 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were excluded if they had active central nervous system (CNS) metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy ≥Grade 2, heart failure, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms. PADCEV was administered at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg, as an intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The median age was 69 years (range: 40 to 84 years) and 70% were male. Racial demographics were reported as White (85%), Asian (9%), Black (2%), Other (0.8%) or not reported (4%). Four percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino. All patients had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (32%) or 1 (68%). Ninety percent of patients had visceral metastases including 40% with liver metastases. Approximately two-thirds (67%) of patients had pure transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) histology; 33% had TCC with other histologic variants. The median number of prior systemic therapies was 3 (range: 1 to 6). Sixty-six percent of patients received prior cisplatin-based regimens, 26% received prior carboplatin-based regimens, and an additional 8% received both cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using RECIST v1.1. Efficacy results are presented in Table 13 . Table 13.

Duration of Response, months (95% CI) 7.6 (6.3, NE) Previously Treated Cisplatin Ineligible Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma EV-201, Cohort 2 The efficacy of PADCEV as a single agent was also evaluated in Cohort 2 of EV-201, a single-arm, multi-cohort, multicenter trial in 89 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received prior treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and were cisplatin ineligible and did not receive platinum in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. Patients were excluded if they had active CNS metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy ≥Grade 2, heart failure, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms. PADCEV was administered at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg, as an intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The median age was 75 years (range: 49 to 90 years), 74% were male. Racial demographics were reported as White (70%), Asian (22%) or not reported (8%). One percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino. Patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (42%), 1 (46%) and 2 (12%). Forty-three percent of patients had tumors located in the upper tract that included the renal pelvis and ureter. Seventy-nine percent of patients had visceral metastases and 24% had liver metastases. Reasons for cisplatin ineligibility included: 66% with baseline creatinine clearance of 30 – 59 mL/min, 7% with ECOG PS of 2, 15% with Grade 2 or greater hearing loss, and 12% with more than one cisplatin-ineligibility criteria. Seventy percent of patients had TCC histology; 13% had TCC with squamous differentiation and 17% had TCC with other histologic variants. The median number of prior systemic therapies was 1 (range: 1 to 4). Efficacy results are presented in Table 14 below. Table 14.

Patients with active CNS metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy Grade ≥2, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms were excluded from participating in the study. Patients in the dose escalation cohort (n=5), Cohort A (n=40), and Cohort K (n=76) received PADCEV 1.25 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg as an IV infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle approximately 30 minutes after PADCEV. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 121 patients received PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab. The median age was 71 years (range: 51 to 91); 74% were male; 85% were White, 5% were Black, 4% were Asian and 6% were other, unknown or not reported. Ten percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino. Forty-five percent of patients had an ECOG performance status of 1 and 15% had an ECOG performance status of 2. Forty-seven percent of patients had a documented baseline HbA1c of <5.7%. Reasons for cisplatin ineligibility included: 60% with baseline creatinine clearance of 30 ̶ 59 mL/min, 10% with ECOG PS of 2, 13% with Grade 2 or greater hearing loss, and 16% with more than one cisplatin-ineligibility criteria. At baseline, 97.5% of patients had metastatic urothelial cancer and 2.5% of patients had locally advanced urothelial cancer. Thirty-seven percent of patients had upper tract disease. Eighty-four percent of patients had visceral metastasis at baseline including 22% with liver metastases. Thirty-nine percent of patients had TCC histology; 13% had TCC with squamous differentiation and 48% had TCC with other histologic variants. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1. The median follow-up time for the dose escalation cohort + Cohort A was 44.7 months (range: 0.7 to 52.4) and for Cohort K was 14.8 months (range: 0.6 to 26.2).
