(2.5, 7.1, 12.3) BCRP Inhibitors: Monitor for potential increased adverse reactions. (7.1) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on TALZENNA Effect of P-gp Inhibitors Coadministration with P-gp inhibitors may increase talazoparib exposure. In the clinical studies, coadministration with P-gp inhibitors including amiodarone, carvedilol, clarithromycin, itraconazole, and verapamil resulted in an approximate 45% increase in talazoparib exposure and an increase in the rate of TALZENNA dose reduction. If coadministration of TALZENNA with these P-gp inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the TALZENNA dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. When the P-gp inhibitor is discontinued, increase the TALZENNA dose (after 3–5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the P-gp inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When coadministering TALZENNA with P-gp inhibitors not listed above, monitor patients for potential increased adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect of BCRP inhibitors Coadministration with BCRP inhibitors may increase talazoparib exposure.

        "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with talazoparib. Talazoparib was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats. This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary pharmacology of talazoparib, indicating the potential for genotoxicity in humans. Talazoparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test. Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with talazoparib. In repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 3-months duration, talazoparib-related findings in the testis and epididymis at doses ≥0.04 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥0.01 mg/kg/day in dogs included decreased organ weights, luminal cellular debris, reduced sperm, and degeneration/atrophy. These doses in rats and dogs resulted in approximately 1.0 times and 0.2 times, respectively, the exposure (AUC) in humans at the recommended dose. Follicular atresia of the ovary was observed in rats at doses ≥1 mg/kg/day talazoparib, approximately 9.5 times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose."

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Talazoparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, including PARP1 and PARP2, which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies with cancer cell lines that harbored defects in DNA repair genes, including BRCA 1 and 2, have shown that talazoparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA damage, decreased cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Talazoparib anti-tumor activity was observed in human patient-derived xenograft breast cancer tumor models that expressed mutated or wild-type BRCA 1 and 2."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of 1 mg TALZENNA once daily in patients, the recommended dose, the geometric mean [% coefficient of variation (CV%)] of AUC and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of talazoparib at steady-state was 208 (37%) ng.hr/mL and 16.4 (32%) ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of talazoparib is linear from 0.025 mg to 2 mg (2 times the recommended dose). The median accumulation ratio of talazoparib following repeated oral administration of 1 mg once daily was in the range of 2.3 to 5.2. Talazoparib plasma concentrations reached steady-state within 2 to 3 weeks. Absorption Following oral administration of talazoparib, the median time to Cmax (Tmax) was generally between 1 to 2 hours after dosing. Food Effect Following a single oral dose of 0.5 mg TALZENNA with high-fat, high-calorie food (approximately 800 to 1000 calories with 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), the mean Cmax of talazoparib was decreased by 46%, the median Tmax was delayed from 1 to 4 hours, and AUCinf was not affected. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution of talazoparib is 420 L. In vitro, protein binding of talazoparib is 74% and is independent of talazoparib concentration. Elimination The mean terminal plasma half-life (±standard deviation) of talazoparib is 90 (±58) hours, and the mean apparent oral clearance (inter-subject variability) is 6.45 L/h (31.1%) in cancer patients. Metabolism Talazoparib undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism. The identified metabolic pathways of talazoparib in humans include mono-oxidation, dehydrogenation, cysteine conjugation of mono-desfluoro-talazoparib, and glucuronide conjugation. Excretion Excretion of talazoparib in urine was the major route of elimination. Approximately 68.7% (54.6% unchanged) of the total administered radioactive dose [14C]talazoparib was recovered in urine, and 19.7% (13.6% unchanged) was recovered in feces. Specific Populations Age (18 to 88 years), sex, race (361 White, 41 Asian, 16 Black, 9 Others, and 63 Not Reported), and body weight (36 to 162 kg) had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of talazoparib. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of talazoparib have not been evaluated in patients <18 years of age. Patients with Renal Impairment Talazoparib CL/F was decreased by 14.4% in patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 – 89 mL/min) and 37.1% in patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 – 59 mL/min), when compared to patients with normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min). The PK of talazoparib have not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) or in patients requiring hemodialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤1.0 × ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) had no effect on the PK of talazoparib. The PK of talazoparib have not been studied in patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3.0 × ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3.0 × ULN and any AST). Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Talazoparib Effect of P-gp inhibitors: Coadministration with P-gp inhibitors including amiodarone, carvedilol, clarithromycin, itraconazole, and verapamil in clinical studies increased talazoparib exposure by 45% [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Coadministration with P-gp inhibitors including azithromycin, atorvastatin, diltiazem, felodipine, fluvoxamine, and quercetin in clinical studies increased talazoparib exposure by 8% [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Interactions (7)]. Effect of P-gp inducers: The effect of P-gp inducers on PK of talazoparib has not been studied. Effect of BCRP inhibitors: The effect of BCRP inhibitors on PK of talazoparib has not been studied. Coadministration with BCRP inhibitors may increase talazoparib exposure [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Effect of acid-reducing agents on talazoparib: Coadministration of acid-reducing agents including proton pump inhibitors (PPI), histamine receptor 2 antagonists (H2RA), or other acid reducing agents has no effect on the absorption of talazoparib. In Vitro Studies Talazoparib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP transporters. Talazoparib is not a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide [OATP]1B1, OATP1B3, organic cationic transporter [OCT]1, OCT2, organic anion transporter [OAT]1, OAT3, bile salt export pump [BSEP], multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE]1, and MATE2-K. Talazoparib is not an inhibitor of cytochrome (CYP)1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5, or inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. Talazoparib is not an inhibitor of transporters including P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, BSEP, MATE1, and MATE2-K. Talazoparib is not an inhibitor of uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms (1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7, and 2B15)."

There are no available data on TALZENNA use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In an animal reproduction study, the administration of talazoparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused fetal malformations and structural skeletal variations and embryo-fetal death at maternal exposures that were 0.24 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose of 1 mg daily (see Data). Apprise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the general U.S. population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development toxicity study, pregnant rats received oral doses of 0.015, 0.05, and 0.15 mg/kg/day talazoparib during the period of organogenesis. Talazoparib caused embryo-fetal death at doses ≥0.015 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.24 times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose). A dose of 0.015 mg/kg/day caused decreased fetal body weights and an increased incidence of fetal malformations (depressed eye bulge, small eye, split sternebra, and fused cervical vertebral arch) and structural variations including misshapen or incomplete ossification of the sternebra, skull, rib, and vertebra."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): MDS/AML has been reported in 2 out of 584 (0.3%) solid tumor patients treated with TALZENNA in clinical studies. Monitor patients for hematological toxicity at baseline and monthly thereafter. Discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed. (5.1) Myelosuppression: TALZENNA may affect hematopoiesis and can cause anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. (5.2) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: TALZENNA can cause fetal harm. Advise of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.3, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) have been reported in patients who received TALZENNA. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in 2 out of 584 (0.3%) solid tumor patients treated with TALZENNA in clinical studies. The duration of TALZENNA treatment in these two patients prior to developing MDS/AML was 4 months and 24 months, respectively. Both patients had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy. Do not start TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy. Monitor complete blood counts for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt TALZENNA and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue TALZENNA. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression consisting of anemia, leukopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia, have been reported in patients treated with TALZENNA [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Grade ≥3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported, respectively, in 39%, 21%, and 15% of patients receiving TALZENNA. Discontinuation due to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 0.7%, 0.3%, and 0.3% of patients. Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter. Do not start TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous therapy. If this occurs, dose modifications (dosing interruption with or without dose reduction) are recommended [see Dosing Modifications (2.3)]. 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal data, TALZENNA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an animal reproduction study, administration of talazoparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused fetal malformations and structural skeletal variations, and embryo-fetal death at exposures that were 0.24 times the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 1 mg daily. Apprise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of TALZENNA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Based on findings from genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 4 months following the last dose of TALZENNA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]."

        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose of TALZENNA is 1 mg taken as a single oral daily dose, with or without food. (2.2) Patients should be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. (2.2) For adverse reactions, consider dosing interruption or dose reduction. (2.3) For patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 – 59 mL/min), the recommended dose of TALZENNA is 0.75 mg once daily. (2.4) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for the treatment of advanced breast cancer with TALZENNA based on the presence of germline BRCA mutations [see Indications and Usage (1), Clinical Studies (14)]. Information on the FDA-approved test for the detection of BRCA mutations is available at http://www.fda.gov/companiondiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Dosing The recommended dose of TALZENNA is 1 mg taken orally once daily, with or without food. The 0.25 mg capsule is available for dose reduction. Patients should be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. The hard capsules should be swallowed whole and must not be opened or dissolved. If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken. The next prescribed dose should be taken at the usual time. 2.3 Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions To manage adverse reactions, consider interruption of treatment with or without dose reduction based on severity and clinical presentation. Recommended dose reductions are indicated in Table 1 and Table 2. Treatment with TALZENNA should be discontinued if more than three dose reductions are required. Table 1. Dose Reduction Levels for Adverse Reactions Dose Level Dose Recommended starting dose 1 mg (one 1 mg capsule) once daily First dose reduction 0.75 mg (three 0.25 mg capsules) once daily Second dose reduction 0.5 mg (two 0.25 mg capsules) once daily Third dose reduction 0.25 mg (one 0.25 mg capsule) once daily Table 2. Dose Modification and Management Monitor complete blood counts monthly and as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Most common (≥20%) adverse reactions of any grade were: Fatigue, anemia, nausea, neutropenia, headache, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, alopecia, diarrhea, decreased appetite. (6.1) Most common laboratory abnormalities (≥25%) were: Decreases in hemoglobin, platelets, neutrophils, lymphocytes, leukocytes, and calcium. Increases in glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer, Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Treatment of gBRCAm HER2-negative Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer EMBRACA The safety of TALZENNA as monotherapy was evaluated in gBRCAm patients with HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had previously received no more than 3 lines of chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic disease. EMBRACA was a randomized, open-label, multi-center study in which 412 patients received either TALZENNA 1 mg once daily (n=286) or a chemotherapy agent (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine) of the healthcare provider's choice (n=126) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of study treatment was 6.1 months in patients who received TALZENNA and 3.9 months in patients who received chemotherapy. Dosing interruptions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 65% of patients receiving TALZENNA and 50% of those receiving chemotherapy; dose reductions due to any cause occurred in 53% of TALZENNA patients and 40% of chemotherapy patients. Permanent discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 5% of TALZENNA patients and 6% chemotherapy patients. Table 3 and Table 4 summarize the most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients treated with TALZENNA or chemotherapy in the EMBRACA study. Table 3.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise women not to breastfeed. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], TALZENNA can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on TALZENNA use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In an animal reproduction study, the administration of talazoparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused fetal malformations and structural skeletal variations and embryo-fetal death at maternal exposures that were 0.24 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose of 1 mg daily (see Data). Apprise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the general U.S. population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development toxicity study, pregnant rats received oral doses of 0.015, 0.05, and 0.15 mg/kg/day talazoparib during the period of organogenesis. Talazoparib caused embryo-fetal death at doses ≥0.015 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.24 times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose). A dose of 0.015 mg/kg/day caused decreased fetal body weights and an increased incidence of fetal malformations (depressed eye bulge, small eye, split sternebra, and fused cervical vertebral arch) and structural variations including misshapen or incomplete ossification of the sternebra, skull, rib, and vertebra. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of talazoparib in human milk, the effects of the drug on milk production, or the effects of the drug on the breastfed child. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from talazoparib, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with TALZENNA and for at least 1 month after the final dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TALZENNA treatment. Contraception Females TALZENNA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of TALZENNA. Males Based on genotoxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential and pregnant partners to use effective contraception during treatment with TALZENNA and for at least 4 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Infertility Males Based on animal studies, TALZENNA may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TALZENNA have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical trials of TALZENNA enrolling 494 patients with advanced solid tumors who received TALZENNA 1 mg daily as monotherapy, 85 (17%) patients were ≥65 years of age, and this included 19 (4%) patients who were ≥75 years old. There were 5 patients ≥85 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of TALZENNA were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment Reduce the recommended dose of TALZENNA in patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 – 59 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 – 89 mL/min). TALZENNA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) or patients requiring hemodialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment TALZENNA has not been studied in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3.0 × upper limit of normal [ULN] and any aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3.0 × ULN and any AST). No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤1 × ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

MDS/AML: Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience weakness, feeling tired, fever, weight loss, frequent infections, bruising, bleeding easily, breathlessness, blood in urine or stool, and/or laboratory findings of low blood cell counts, or a need for blood transfusions. This may be a sign of hematological toxicity or a more serious uncommon bone marrow problem called MDS or AML, which have been reported in patients who received PARP inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Myelosuppression: Advise patients that TALZENNA may affect hematopoiesis and can cause anemia, leukopenia/neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Administration Instructions: Advise patients that TALZENNA can be taken once daily with or without food. Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of TALZENNA, they should take their next normal dose at the usual time. Also advise patients to swallow each capsule whole, and that capsules must not be opened or dissolved [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Advise females to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or become pregnant. Inform female patients of the risk to a fetus and potential loss of the pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TALZENNA and for at least 7 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 4 months after receiving the last dose of TALZENNA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES EMBRACA Study (NCT01945775) Deleterious or Suspected Deleterious Germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) HER2-negative Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer EMBRACA (NCT01945775) was an open-label study in which patients (N=431) with gBRCAm HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomized 2:1 to receive TALZENNA 1 mg or healthcare provider's choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by prior use of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (0 versus 1, 2, or 3), by triple-negative disease status (triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC] versus non-TNBC), and history of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (yes versus no). Patients received no more than 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic or locally advanced disease. Patients were required to have received treatment with an anthracycline and/or a taxane (unless contraindicated) in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and/or metastatic treatment setting. First-line treatment for advanced or metastatic disease with no prior adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed if the investigator determined that 1 of the 4 chemotherapy choices in the control arm would be an appropriate treatment option for the patient. Patients with prior platinum therapy for advanced disease were required to have no evidence of disease progression during platinum therapy. No prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor was permitted. Of the 431 patients randomized in the EMBRACA study, 408 (95%) were centrally confirmed to have a deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm using a clinical trial assay; out of which 354 (82%) were confirmed using the BRACAnalysis CDx®. BRCA mutation status (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 [BRCA1] positive or breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 [BRCA2] positive) was similar across both treatment arms. The median age of patients treated with TALZENNA was 45 years (range 27 to 84) and 50 years (range 24 to 88) among patients treated with chemotherapy. Among all randomized patients, 1% versus 2% were males, 67% versus 75% were White; 11% versus 11% were Asian, and 4% versus 1% were Black or African American in the TALZENNA and chemotherapy arms, respectively. Almost all patients (98%) in both arms had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Approximately 56% of patients had estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive disease; 44% of patients had triple-negative disease, and the proportions were balanced across both treatment arms. Fifteen percent (15%) of patients in the TALZENNA arm and 14% of patients in the chemotherapy arm had a history of CNS metastases. Ninety-one percent (91%) of patients in the TALZENNA arm had received prior taxane therapy, and 85% had received prior anthracycline therapy in any setting. Sixteen percent (16%) of patients in the TALZENNA arm and 21% of patients in the chemotherapy arm had received prior platinum treatment in any setting. The median number of prior cytotoxic regimens for patients with advanced breast cancer was one; 38% received no prior cytotoxic regimens for advanced or metastatic disease, 37% received one, 20% received two, and 5% received three or more prior cytotoxic regimens. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). A statistically significant improvement in PFS was demonstrated for TALZENNA compared with chemotherapy. A sensitivity analysis of investigator-assessed PFS was consistent with the BICR-assessed PFS results. Consistent PFS results were observed across patient subgroups defined by study stratification factors (line of therapy, TNBC status, and history of CNS metastases). The overall survival (OS) data were not mature at the time of the final PFS analysis (38% of patients had died). Efficacy data from the EMBRACA study are summarized in Table 5, and the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS are shown in Figure 1. Table 5.

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Talazoparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, including PARP1 and PARP2, which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies with cancer cell lines that harbored defects in DNA repair genes, including BRCA 1 and 2, have shown that talazoparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA damage, decreased cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Talazoparib anti-tumor activity was observed in human patient-derived xenograft breast cancer tumor models that expressed mutated or wild-type BRCA 1 and 2. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of talazoparib on cardiac repolarization was evaluated in 37 patients with advanced solid tumors. Talazoparib had no large QTc prolongation (i.e., >20 ms) at the recommended dose. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of 1 mg TALZENNA once daily in patients, the recommended dose, the geometric mean [% coefficient of variation (CV%)] of AUC and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) of talazoparib at steady-state was 208 (37%) ng.hr/mL and 16.4 (32%) ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of talazoparib is linear from 0.025 mg to 2 mg (2 times the recommended dose). The median accumulation ratio of talazoparib following repeated oral administration of 1 mg once daily was in the range of 2.3 to 5.2. Talazoparib plasma concentrations reached steady-state within 2 to 3 weeks. Absorption Following oral administration of talazoparib, the median time to Cmax (Tmax) was generally between 1 to 2 hours after dosing. Food Effect Following a single oral dose of 0.5 mg TALZENNA with high-fat, high-calorie food (approximately 800 to 1000 calories with 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), the mean Cmax of talazoparib was decreased by 46%, the median Tmax was delayed from 1 to 4 hours, and AUCinf was not affected. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution of talazoparib is 420 L. In vitro, protein binding of talazoparib is 74% and is independent of talazoparib concentration. Elimination The mean terminal plasma half-life (±standard deviation) of talazoparib is 90 (±58) hours, and the mean apparent oral clearance (inter-subject variability) is 6.45 L/h (31.1%) in cancer patients. Metabolism Talazoparib undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism. The identified metabolic pathways of talazoparib in humans include mono-oxidation, dehydrogenation, cysteine conjugation of mono-desfluoro-talazoparib, and glucuronide conjugation. Excretion Excretion of talazoparib in urine was the major route of elimination. Approximately 68.7% (54.6% unchanged) of the total administered radioactive dose [14C]talazoparib was recovered in urine, and 19.7% (13.6% unchanged) was recovered in feces. Specific Populations Age (18 to 88 years), sex, race (361 White, 41 Asian, 16 Black, 9 Others, and 63 Not Reported), and body weight (36 to 162 kg) had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of talazoparib. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of talazoparib have not been evaluated in patients <18 years of age. Patients with Renal Impairment Talazoparib CL/F was decreased by 14.4% in patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 – 89 mL/min) and 37.1% in patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 – 59 mL/min), when compared to patients with normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min). The PK of talazoparib have not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) or in patients requiring hemodialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤1.0 × ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) had no effect on the PK of talazoparib. The PK of talazoparib have not been studied in patients with moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3.0 × ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3.0 × ULN and any AST). Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Talazoparib Effect of P-gp inhibitors: Coadministration with P-gp inhibitors including amiodarone, carvedilol, clarithromycin, itraconazole, and verapamil in clinical studies increased talazoparib exposure by 45% [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Coadministration with P-gp inhibitors including azithromycin, atorvastatin, diltiazem, felodipine, fluvoxamine, and quercetin in clinical studies increased talazoparib exposure by 8% [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Interactions (7)]. Effect of P-gp inducers: The effect of P-gp inducers on PK of talazoparib has not been studied. Effect of BCRP inhibitors: The effect of BCRP inhibitors on PK of talazoparib has not been studied. Coadministration with BCRP inhibitors may increase talazoparib exposure [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Effect of acid-reducing agents on talazoparib: Coadministration of acid-reducing agents including proton pump inhibitors (PPI), histamine receptor 2 antagonists (H2RA), or other acid reducing agents has no effect on the absorption of talazoparib. In Vitro Studies Talazoparib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP transporters. Talazoparib is not a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide [OATP]1B1, OATP1B3, organic cationic transporter [OCT]1, OCT2, organic anion transporter [OAT]1, OAT3, bile salt export pump [BSEP], multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE]1, and MATE2-K. Talazoparib is not an inhibitor of cytochrome (CYP)1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5, or inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. Talazoparib is not an inhibitor of transporters including P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, BSEP, MATE1, and MATE2-K. Talazoparib is not an inhibitor of uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms (1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7, and 2B15)."

        "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with talazoparib. Talazoparib was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats. This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary pharmacology of talazoparib, indicating the potential for genotoxicity in humans. Talazoparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test. Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with talazoparib. In repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 3-months duration, talazoparib-related findings in the testis and epididymis at doses ≥0.04 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥0.01 mg/kg/day in dogs included decreased organ weights, luminal cellular debris, reduced sperm, and degeneration/atrophy. These doses in rats and dogs resulted in approximately 1.0 times and 0.2 times, respectively, the exposure (AUC) in humans at the recommended dose. Follicular atresia of the ovary was observed in rats at doses ≥1 mg/kg/day talazoparib, approximately 9.5 times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose."
