This study of single agent MEKINIST in melanoma did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults.Of the 994 patients with melanoma who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI-d, COMBI-v, and COMBI-AD studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)], 21% were aged 65 years and older and 5% were aged 75 years and older. No overall differences in the effectiveness of MEKINIST plus dabrafenib were observed in geriatric patients as compared to younger adults across these melanoma studies. The incidences of peripheral edema (26% vs. 12%) and anorexia (21% vs. 9%) increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger adults in these studies.Of the 93 patients with NSCLC who received MEKINIST in Study BRF113928, there were insufficient numbers of geriatric patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].Of the 26 patients with ATC who received MEKINIST in Study BRF117019, 77% were aged 65 years and older and 31% were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of ActionTrametinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and of MEK1 and MEK2 kinase activity. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which promotes cellular proliferation. BRAF V600E mutations result in constitutive activation of the BRAF pathway which includes MEK1 and MEK2. Trametinib inhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo.Trametinib and dabrafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Use of trametinib and dabrafenib in combination resulted in greater growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation positive tumor xenografts compared with either drug alone."

      "pharmacokinetics": [
        "12.3 PharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetics of trametinib were characterized following single- and repeat-oral administration in patients with solid tumors and BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma.AbsorptionAfter oral administration of MEKINIST, the median time to achieve peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) is 1.5 hours post-dose. The mean absolute bioavailability of a single oral dose of MEKINIST 2 mg is 72%. The increase in Cmax was dose proportional after a single dose of 0.125 mg (0.0625 times the approved recommended dosage) to 10 mg (5 times the approved recommended dosage) while the increase in AUC was greater than dose proportional. After repeat doses of 0.125 mg to 4 mg daily, both Cmax and AUC increase proportionally with dose. Inter-subject variability in AUC and Cmax at steady state is 22% and 28%, respectively.Effect of FoodAdministration of a single dose of MEKINIST with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 1000 calories) decreased trametinib AUC by 24%, Cmax by 70%, and delayed Tmax by approximately 4 hours as compared with fasted conditions.DistributionTrametinib is 97.4% bound to human plasma proteins. The apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) is 214 L.EliminationThe estimated elimination half-life of trametinib based on the population PK model is 3.9 to 4.8 days. The apparent clearance is 4.9 L/h.MetabolismTrametinib is metabolized predominantly via deacetylation alone or with mono-oxygenation or in combination with glucuronidation biotransformation pathways in vitro. Deacetylation is mediated by carboxylesterases (i.e., carboxylesterase 1b/c and 2) and may also be mediated by other hydrolytic enzymes.Following a single dose of [14C]-trametinib, approximately 50% of circulating radioactivity is represented as the parent compound. However, based on metabolite profiling after repeat dosing of trametinib, ≥ 75% of drug-related material in plasma is the parent compound.ExcretionFollowing oral administration of [14C]-trametinib, greater than 80% of excreted radioactivity was recovered in the feces while less than 20% of excreted radioactivity was recovered in the urine with less than 0.1% of the excreted dose as parent.Specific PopulationsAge, sex, and body weight do not have a clinically important effect on the exposure of trametinib. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the exposure of trametinib by race or ethnicity.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 64 patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5x ULN and any AST), mild hepatic impairment has no clinically important effect on the systemic exposure of trametinib. The pharmacokinetics of trametinib have not been studied in patients with moderate (bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) or severe (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment.Patients with Renal Impairment: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 223 patients with mild renal impairment (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 35 patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2), mild and moderate renal impairment have no clinically important effects on the systemic exposure of trametinib. The pharmacokinetics of trametinib have not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Drug Interaction StudiesEffect of Dabrafenib on Trametinib: Coadministration of trametinib 2 mg daily with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily resulted in no change in AUC of trametinib as compared with administration of trametinib.Effect of Trametinib on CYP Substrates: Based on in vitro studies, trametinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, but is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 at a clinically relevant systemic concentration of 0.04 µM. Trametinib is an inducer of CYP3A in vitro. Based on cross-study comparisons, oral administration of MEKINIST 2 mg once daily with a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate had no clinically important effect on the AUC and Cmax of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate.Effect of Transporters on Trametinib: Trametinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BSEP. Inhibition of P-gp is unlikely to result in a clinically important increase in trametinib concentrations as trametinib exhibits high passive permeability and bioavailability. Trametinib is not a substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1, MRP2, or MATE1 in vitro.Effect of Trametinib on Transporters: Based on in vitro studies, trametinib is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, BSEP, MRP2, or MATE1 at a clinically relevant systemic concentration of 0.04 µM."

There is insufficient data in pregnant women exposed to MEKINIST to assess the risks. Trametinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.DataAnimal Data In reproductive toxicity studies, administration of trametinib to rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal weights at doses greater than or equal to 0.031 mg/kg/day [approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on area under the curve (AUC)]. In rats, at a dose resulting in exposures 1.8-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended dose, there was maternal toxicity and an increase in post-implantation loss.In pregnant rabbits, administration of trametinib during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weight and increased incidence of variations in ossification at doses greater than or equal to 0.039 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.08 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC). In rabbits administered trametinib at 0.15 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC) there was an increase in post-implantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy, compared with control animals."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSNew Primary Malignancies, Cutaneous, and Non-cutaneous, can occur when MEKINIST is used with dabrafenib. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of therapy, while on therapy, and following discontinuation of treatment. (5.1) Hemorrhage: Major hemorrhagic events can occur. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. (5.2) Colitis and Gastrointestinal Perforation: Colitis and gastrointestinal perforation can occur in patients receiving MEKINIST. (5.3) Venous Thromboembolism: Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE) can occur in patients receiving MEKINIST. (5.4, 2.7) Cardiomyopathy: Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before treatment, after one month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter. (5.5, 2.7) Ocular Toxicities: Perform ophthalmologic evaluation for any visual disturbances. For Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), permanently discontinue MEKINIST. (5.6, 2.7) Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): Withhold MEKINIST for new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis. (5.7, 2.7) Serious Febrile Reactions, can occur when MEKINIST is used with dabrafenib. (5.8, 2.7) Serious Skin Toxicities: Monitor for skin toxicities and for secondary infections. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for intolerable Grade 2, or Grade 3 or 4 rash not improving within 3 weeks despite interruption of MEKINIST. Permanently discontinue for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). (5.9, 2.7) Hyperglycemia: Monitor serum glucose levels in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. (5.10) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.12, 8.1, 8.3)5.1 New Primary MalignanciesCutaneous MalignanciesAcross clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCCs) and keratoacanthomas occurred in 2% of patients. Basal cell carcinoma and new primary melanoma occurred in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively.Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of MEKINIST when used with dabrafenib, every 2 months while on therapy, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of the combination. Non-Cutaneous MalignanciesBased on its mechanism of action, dabrafenib may promote growth and development of malignancies with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms; refer to the Prescribing Information for dabrafenib. Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, non-cutaneous malignancies occurred in 1% of patients.Monitor patients receiving MEKINIST and dabrafenib closely for signs or symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. No dose modification is required for MEKINIST in patients who develop non-cutaneous malignancies. 5.2 HemorrhageHemorrhages, including major hemorrhages defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur with MEKINIST. Fatal cases have been reported.Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, hemorrhagic events occurred in 17% of patients. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib. Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 0.6% of patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib. Fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.5% of patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib. The fatal events were cerebral hemorrhage and brainstem hemorrhage.Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any Grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold MEKINIST for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved, resume at the next lower dose level.5.3 Colitis and Gastrointestinal PerforationColitis and gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients taking MEKINIST as a single agent and when administered with dabrafenib. Across clinical trials of MEKINIST, colitis occurred in < 1% of patients and gastrointestinal perforation occurred in < 1% of patients. Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, colitis occurred in < 1% of patients and gastrointestinal perforation occurred in < 1% of patients.Monitor patients closely for colitis and gastrointestinal perforations.5.4 Venous Thromboembolic EventsAcross clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in 2% of patients.Advise patients to immediately seek medical care if they develop symptoms of DVT or PE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for life-threatening PE. Withhold MEKINIST for uncomplicated DVT and PE for up to 3 weeks; if improved, MEKINIST may be resumed at a lower dose level [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].5.5 Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy, including cardiac failure, can occur with MEKINIST. Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 10% from baseline and below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN), occurred in 6% of patients. Development of cardiomyopathy resulted in dose interruption or discontinuation of MEKINIST in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 45 of 50 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib. Assess LVEF by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of MEKINIST as a single agent or with dabrafenib, one month after initiation, and then at 2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment. For an asymptomatic absolute decrease in LVEF of 10% or greater from baseline that is below the LLN, withhold MEKINIST for up to 4 weeks. If improved to normal LVEF value, resume at a lower dose. If no improvement to normal LVEF value within 4 weeks, permanently discontinue MEKINIST. For symptomatic cardiomyopathy or an absolute decrease in LVEF of greater than 20% from baseline that is below LLN, permanently discontinue MEKINIST [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.6 Ocular ToxicitiesRetinal Vein OcclusionAcross clinical trials with MEKINIST monotherapy, the incidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) was 0.6%. Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, there were no cases of RVO. RVO may lead to macular edema, decreased visual function, neovascularization, and glaucoma.Urgently (within 24 hours) perform ophthalmological evaluation for patient-reported loss of vision or other visual disturbances. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST in patients with documented RVO [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Retinal Pigment Epithelial DetachmentRetinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) can occur with MEKINIST. Retinal detachments may be bilateral and multifocal, occurring in the central macular region of the retina or elsewhere in the retina. In melanoma and NSCLC trials, routine monitoring of patients to detect asymptomatic RPED was not conducted; therefore, the true incidence of this finding is unknown. Perform ophthalmological evaluation periodically and at any time a patient reports visual disturbances. Withhold MEKINIST if RPED is diagnosed. If resolution of the RPED is documented on repeat ophthalmological evaluation within 3 weeks, resume MEKINIST at same or reduced dose. If no improvement after 3 weeks, resume at reduced dose or permanently discontinue MEKINIST [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.7 Interstitial Lung Disease/PneumonitisAcross clinical trials of MEKINIST monotherapy, interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 2% of patients. Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 1% of patients.Withhold MEKINIST in patients presenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings, including cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].5.8 Serious Febrile ReactionsSerious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur when MEKINIST is administered with dabrafenib. Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration or renal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%, dehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in < 1% of patients.Withhold MEKINIST for fever higher than 104ºF or fever accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, and evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection. Monitor serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe pyrexia. Upon resolution, resume at same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Administer antipyretics as secondary prophylaxis when resuming MEKINIST if patient had a prior episode of severe febrile reaction or fever associated with complications. Administer corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 10 mg daily) for at least 5 days for second or subsequent pyrexia if temperature does not return to baseline within 3 days of onset of pyrexia, or for pyrexia associated with complications, such as dehydration, hypotension renal failure, or severe chills/rigors, and there is no evidence of active infection. 5.9 Serious Skin ToxicitiesSevere cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, other serious skin toxicity occurred in < 1% of patients.Monitor for new or worsening serious skin reactions. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for SCARs [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. For other skin toxicities, withhold MEKINIST for intolerable or severe skin toxicity. Resume MEKINIST at a lower dose in patients with improvement or recovery from skin toxicity within 3 weeks. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST if skin toxicity has not improved in 3 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].5.10 HyperglycemiaAcross clinical trials of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 15% of patients with a history of diabetes who had received MEKINIST with dabrafenib required more intensive hypoglycemic therapy. Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia occurred in 2% of patients.Monitor serum glucose levels upon initiation and as clinically appropriate when MEKINIST is administered with dabrafenib in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated. 5.11 Risks Associated With Combination TreatmentMEKINIST is indicated for use in combination with dabrafenib. Review the Prescribing Information for dabrafenib for information on the serious risks of dabrafenib prior to initiation of MEKINIST with dabrafenib.5.12 Embryo-Fetal ToxicityBased on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Trametinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months after treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]."

Among the 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for at least one year. Among the 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year.Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive MelanomaMEKINIST as a Single AgentThe safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months.In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST. Tables 3 and 4 present adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, of MEKINIST as a single agent in the METRIC study.Table 3.

In both trials, patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trials excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), history of RVO or RPED, QTcB interval ≥ 480 msec, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, or known history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.Among these 559 patients, 197 (35%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months, while 185 (33%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91), 57% were male, and 98% were white, 72% had baseline ECOG performance status 0 and 28% had ECOG performance status 1, 64% had M1c stage disease, 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline, and 0.5% had a history of brain metastases.The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) for MEKINIST in patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib were: pyrexia, nausea, rash, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension, and peripheral edema.The demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in the COMBI-d study are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib had a median duration of exposure of 11 months (range: 3 days to 30 months) to MEKINIST. Among the 209 patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib, 26% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 46% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year.In the COMBI-d study, adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of MEKINIST occurred in 11% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (1.4%) and decreased ejection fraction (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of MEKINIST occurred in 18% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (2.9%), neutropenia (1.9%), decreased ejection fraction (1.9%), and rash (1.9%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of MEKINIST occurred in 46% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (18%), chills (7%), vomiting (6%), and decreased ejection fraction (4.8%).Table 5 and Table 6 present selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, of MEKINIST observed in the COMBI-d study.Table 5.

Patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily for 12 months. The trial excluded patients with abnormal LVEF; history of acute coronary syndromes, coronary angioplasty, or stenting within 6 months; Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association); QTc interval ≥ 480 msec; treatment refractory hypertension; uncontrolled arrhythmias; or history of RVO.Patients who received MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib had a median duration of exposure of 11 months (range: 0 to 12) to MEKINIST. Among the 435 patients who received MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib, 72% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months. The median age of patients who received MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib was 50 years (range: 18 to 89), 56% were male, 99% were white, 92% had baseline ECOG performance status 0, and 8% had baseline ECOG performance status 1.The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients who received MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib were: pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, headache, rash, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia.Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation and dose interruptions of MEKINIST occurred in 24% and 54% of patients, respectively; the most frequent for each were pyrexia and chills.

Patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), QTc interval ≥ 480 msec, treatment refractory hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, history of ILD or pneumonitis, or history or current RVO [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].Among these 93 patients, 53 (57%) were exposed to MEKINIST and dabrafenib for > 6 months and 27 (29%) were exposed to MEKINIST and dabrafenib for ≥ 1 year. The median age was 65 years (range: 41 to 91), 46% were male, 85% were white; 32% had baseline ECOG performance status 0 and 61% had ECOG performance status 1; 98% had non-squamous histology; and 12% were current smokers, 60% were former smokers, and 28% had never smoked.The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in these 93 patients were: pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dry skin, decreased appetite, edema, rash, chills, hemorrhage, cough, and dyspnea.Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of MEKINIST occurred in 19% of patients; the most frequent were pyrexia (2.2%), decreased ejection fraction (2.2%), and respiratory distress (2.2%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of MEKINIST occurred in 30% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (5%), nausea (4.3%), vomiting (4.3%), diarrhea (3.2%), and neutropenia (3.2%).

At the time of the safety analysis, a total of 100 patients were enrolled in the trial, 16 of whom were enrolled in the ATC cohort. The primary safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of MEKINIST or dabrafenib. Patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Among these 100 patients, 46 (46%) were exposed to MEKINIST and dabrafenib for > 6 months and 23 (23%) were exposed to MEKINIST and dabrafenib for ≥ 1 year. The median age was 59.5 years (range: 18 to 85); 62% were male; 85% were white; and 31% had baseline ECOG performance status 0, and 59% had ECOG performance status 1.The adverse reaction profile among all patients and among patients in the ATC cohort was similar to that observed in other approved indications.6.2 Postmarketing ExperienceThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSLactation: Do not breastfeed. (8.2) Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: May impair fertility. Counsel patients on pregnancy planning and prevention. (8.3)8.1 PregnancyRisk SummaryBased on its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] and findings from animal reproduction studies, MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There is insufficient data in pregnant women exposed to MEKINIST to assess the risks. Trametinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose (see Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.DataAnimal Data In reproductive toxicity studies, administration of trametinib to rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal weights at doses greater than or equal to 0.031 mg/kg/day [approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on area under the curve (AUC)]. In rats, at a dose resulting in exposures 1.8-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended dose, there was maternal toxicity and an increase in post-implantation loss.In pregnant rabbits, administration of trametinib during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weight and increased incidence of variations in ossification at doses greater than or equal to 0.039 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.08 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC). In rabbits administered trametinib at 0.15 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC) there was an increase in post-implantation loss, including total loss of pregnancy, compared with control animals.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of trametinib in human milk, or the effects of trametinib on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months following the last dose.8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive PotentialPregnancy TestingVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating MEKINIST.ContraceptionBased on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months after the last dose.MalesTo avoid potential drug exposure to pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive potential, advise male patients (including those who have had vasectomies) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with MEKINIST and for at least 4 months after the last dose.InfertilityFemalesAdvise female patients of reproductive potential that MEKINIST may impair fertility. Increased follicular cysts and decreased corpora lutea were observed in female rats at dose exposures equivalent to 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].8.4 Pediatric UseThe safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST as a single agent or in combination with dabrafenib have not been established in pediatric patients.Juvenile Animal Toxicity DataIn a repeat-dose toxicity study in juvenile rats, decreased bone length and corneal dystrophy were observed at doses resulting in exposures as low as 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC. Additionally, a delay in sexual maturation was noted at doses resulting in exposures as low as 1.6 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC.8.5 Geriatric UseOf the 214 patients with melanoma who received single agent MEKINIST in the METRIC study, 27% were aged 65 years and older and 4% were over 75 years old [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. This study of single agent MEKINIST in melanoma did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults.Of the 994 patients with melanoma who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI-d, COMBI-v, and COMBI-AD studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)], 21% were aged 65 years and older and 5% were aged 75 years and older. No overall differences in the effectiveness of MEKINIST plus dabrafenib were observed in geriatric patients as compared to younger adults across these melanoma studies. The incidences of peripheral edema (26% vs. 12%) and anorexia (21% vs. 9%) increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger adults in these studies.Of the 93 patients with NSCLC who received MEKINIST in Study BRF113928, there were insufficient numbers of geriatric patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].Of the 26 patients with ATC who received MEKINIST in Study BRF117019, 77% were aged 65 years and older and 31% were aged 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. This study did not include sufficient numbers of younger adults to determine whether they respond differently compared to geriatric patients.8.6 Renal ImpairmentNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate renal impairment (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The appropriate dose of MEKINIST has not been established in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2).8.7 Hepatic ImpairmentNo dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or bilirubin > 1x to 1.5x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A recommended dosage of MEKINIST has not been established in patients with moderate (bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) or severe (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment."

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival in the COMBI-d StudyFigure 3. Kaplan-Meier Curves for Relapse-Free Survival in COMBI-AD in the Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma14.1 BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single AgentThe safety and efficacy of MEKINIST were evaluated in an international, multicenter, randomized (2:1), open-label, active-controlled trial (the METRIC study; NCT01245062) in 322 patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In the METRIC study, patients were not permitted to have more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease; prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor or MEK inhibitor was not permitted. Patients were randomized to receive MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily (N = 214) or chemotherapy (N = 108) consisting of either dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified according to prior use of chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease (yes versus no) and LDH level (normal versus greater than ULN). Tumor tissue was evaluated for BRAF mutations at a central testing site using a clinical trial assay. Tumor samples from 289 patients (196 patients treated with MEKINIST and 93 chemotherapy-treated patients) were also tested retrospectively using an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test, THxID®-BRAF assay. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS).The median age for randomized patients was 54 years, 54% were male, greater than 99% were white, and all patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Most patients had metastatic disease (94%), were Stage M1c (64%), had elevated LDH (36%), had no history of brain metastasis (97%), and received no prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease (66%). The distribution of BRAF V600 mutations was BRAF V600E (87%), V600K (12%), or both (less than 1%). The median durations of follow-up prior to initiation of alternative treatment were 4.9 months for patients treated with MEKINIST and 3.1 months for patients treated with chemotherapy. Fifty-one (47%) patients crossed over from the chemotherapy arm at the time of disease progression to receive MEKINIST.The METRIC study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival in the patients treated with MEKINIST.

The COMBI-d study compared dabrafenib plus MEKINIST to dabrafenib plus placebo as first-line treatment for patients with unresectable (Stage IIIc) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive MEKINIST 2 mg once daily plus dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily or dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily plus matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by LDH level (greater than the ULN vs. ≤ ULN) and BRAF mutation subtype (V600E vs. V600K). The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 with additional efficacy outcome measures of overall survival (OS) and confirmed overall response rate (ORR).In the COMBI-d study, 423 patients were randomized to MEKINIST plus dabrafenib (n = 211) or dabrafenib plus placebo (n = 212). The median age was 56 years (range: 22 to 89 years), 53% were male, > 99% were white, 72% had ECOG performance status of 0, 4% had Stage IIIc, 66% had M1c disease, 65% had a normal LDH, and 2 patients had a history of brain metastases. All patients had tumor containing BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as determined by centralized testing with the FDA-approved companion diagnostic test; 85% had BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma and 15% had BRAF V600K mutation-positive melanoma. The COMBI-d study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS and OS. Table 12 and Figure 2 summarize the efficacy results.Table 12.

Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival in the COMBI-d StudyCOMBI-MB StudyThe activity of MEKINIST with dabrafenib for the treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma, metastatic to the brain, was evaluated in a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, multi-cohort trial (the COMBI-MB study; NCT02039947). Eligible patients were required to have at least one measurable intracranial lesion and to have no leptomeningeal disease, parenchymal brain metastasis greater than 4 cm in diameter, ocular melanoma, or primary mucosal melanoma. Patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was intracranial response rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed intracranial response per RECIST v1.1, modified to allow up to five intracranial target lesions at least 5 mm in diameter, as assessed by independent review.The COMBI-MB study enrolled 121 patients with a BRAF V600E (85%) or V600K (15%) mutation. The median age was 54 years (range: 23 to 84 years), 58% were male, 100% were white, 8% were from the United States, 65% had a normal LDH value at baseline, and 97% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Intracranial metastases were asymptomatic in 87% and symptomatic in 13% of patients, 22% received prior local therapy for brain metastases, and 87% also had extracranial metastases.The intracranial response rate was 50% (95% CI: 40, 60), with a complete response rate of 4.1% and a partial response rate of 46%. The median duration of intracranial response was 6.4 months (range: 1 to 31 months). Of the patients with an intracranial response, 9% had stable or progressive disease as their best overall response.14.2 Adjuvant Treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive MelanomaThe safety and efficacy of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib were evaluated in an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (COMBI-AD; NCT01682083) that enrolled patients with Stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as detected by the THxID®-BRAF assay and pathologic involvement of regional lymph node(s). Enrollment required complete resection of melanoma with complete lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to randomization. The trial excluded patients with mucosal or ocular melanoma, unresectable in-transit metastases, distant metastatic disease, or prior systemic anticancer treatment, including radiotherapy. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive MEKINIST 2 mg once daily in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily or two placebos for up to 1 year. Randomization was stratified by BRAF mutation status (V600E or V600K) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC; 7th Edition) stage (IIIa, IIIb, or IIIc). The major efficacy outcome measure was relapse-free survival (RFS) defined as the time from randomization to disease recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first as assessed by the investigator. Patients underwent imaging for tumor recurrence every 3 months for the first two years and every 6 months thereafter.In COMBI-AD, a total of 870 patients were randomized: 438 to the MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and 432 to placebo. Median age was 51 years (range: 18 to 89), 55% were male, 99% were white, and 91% had an ECOG performance status of 0. Disease characteristics were AJCC Stage IIIa (18%), Stage IIIb (41%), Stage IIIc (40%), stage unknown (1%); BRAF V600E mutation (91%), BRAF V600K mutation (9%); macroscopic lymph nodes (65%); and tumor ulceration (41%). The median duration of follow-up (time from randomization to last contact or death) was 2.8 years.COMBI-AD showed a statistically significant improvement in RFS in patients randomized to MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib arm compared to those randomized to placebo. Efficacy results are presented in Table 13 and Figure 3.Table 13.

Kaplan-Meier Curves for Relapse-Free Survival in COMBI-AD in the Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma14.3 BRAF V600E Mutation-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung CancerThe safety and efficacy of dabrafenib alone or administered with MEKINIST were evaluated in a multicenter, three-cohort, non-randomized, activity-estimating, open-label trial (Study BRF113928; NCT01336634). Key eligibility criteria were locally confirmed BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC, no prior exposure to BRAF or MEK inhibitor, and absence of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement (unless patients had progression on prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy). Patients enrolled in Cohorts A and B were required to have received at least one previous platinum-based chemotherapy regimen with demonstrated disease progression but no more than three prior systemic regimens. Patients in Cohort C could not have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Patients in Cohort A received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. Patients in Cohorts B and C received MEKINIST 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. The major efficacy outcome was ORR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and duration of response.There were a total of 171 patients enrolled, which included 78 patients enrolled in Cohort A, 57 patients enrolled in Cohort B, and 36 patients enrolled in Cohort C. The characteristics of the population were: a median age of 66 years; 48% male; 81% white, 14% Asian, 3% black, and 2% Hispanic; 60% former smokers, 32% never smokers, and 8% current smokers; 27% had ECOG performance status (PS) of 0, 63% had ECOG PS of 1, and 11% had ECOG PS of 2; 99% had metastatic disease of which 6% had brain metastasis at baseline and 14% had liver metastasis at baseline; 11% had systemic anti-cancer therapy in the adjuvant setting, 58% of the 135 previously treated patients had only one line of prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease; 98% had non-squamous histology.Efficacy results are summarized in Table 14.Table 14.

Trial BRF117019 excluded patients who could not swallow or retain the medication; who received prior treatment with BRAF or MEK inhibitors; with symptomatic or untreated CNS metastases; or who had airway obstruction. Patients received MEKINIST 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily. The major efficacy outcome measure was ORR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) and duration of response (DoR).At the time of efficacy analysis, 23 patients were evaluable for response in the ATC cohort. Three additional patients were enrolled; however, there was insufficient time to assess response of these patients. Among the 26 patients enrolled, the median age was 70 years (range: 49 to 85); 50% were male, 50% white, 46% Asian; 100% had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; and 54% had a prior history of differentiated thyroid cancer. Prior anti-cancer treatments included surgery (92%), external beam radiotherapy (81%), and systemic therapy (54%).Efficacy results are summarized in Table 15.Table 15.

All patients received MEKINIST at a dose of 2 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.The median age was 58 years, 63% were male, all were white, 98% had baseline ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and the distribution of BRAF V600 mutations was V600E (83%), V600K (10%), and the remaining patients had multiple V600 mutations (5%), or unknown mutational status (2%). No patient achieved a confirmed partial or complete response as determined by the clinical investigators."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY12.1 Mechanism of ActionTrametinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and of MEK1 and MEK2 kinase activity. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which promotes cellular proliferation. BRAF V600E mutations result in constitutive activation of the BRAF pathway which includes MEK1 and MEK2. Trametinib inhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo.Trametinib and dabrafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Use of trametinib and dabrafenib in combination resulted in greater growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation positive tumor xenografts compared with either drug alone.12.2 PharmacodynamicsAdministration of 1 mg and 2 mg MEKINIST to patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma resulted in dose-dependent changes in tumor biomarkers, including inhibition of phosphorylated ERK, inhibition of Ki67 (a marker of cell proliferation), and increases in p27 (a marker of apoptosis).Cardiac ElectrophysiologyThe heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) prolongation potential of trametinib was assessed in a dedicated study in 32 patients who received placebo on day 1 and MEKINIST 2 mg once daily on days 2-14 followed by MEKINIST 3 mg on day 15. No clinically relevant QTc prolongation was detected in the study.In clinical trials in patients who received MEKINIST with dabrafenib, QTc prolongation > 500 ms occurred in 0.8% of patients and QTc increased by > 60 ms from baseline in 3.8% of patients.12.3 PharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetics of trametinib were characterized following single- and repeat-oral administration in patients with solid tumors and BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma.AbsorptionAfter oral administration of MEKINIST, the median time to achieve peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) is 1.5 hours post-dose. The mean absolute bioavailability of a single oral dose of MEKINIST 2 mg is 72%. The increase in Cmax was dose proportional after a single dose of 0.125 mg (0.0625 times the approved recommended dosage) to 10 mg (5 times the approved recommended dosage) while the increase in AUC was greater than dose proportional. After repeat doses of 0.125 mg to 4 mg daily, both Cmax and AUC increase proportionally with dose. Inter-subject variability in AUC and Cmax at steady state is 22% and 28%, respectively.Effect of FoodAdministration of a single dose of MEKINIST with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 1000 calories) decreased trametinib AUC by 24%, Cmax by 70%, and delayed Tmax by approximately 4 hours as compared with fasted conditions.DistributionTrametinib is 97.4% bound to human plasma proteins. The apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) is 214 L.EliminationThe estimated elimination half-life of trametinib based on the population PK model is 3.9 to 4.8 days. The apparent clearance is 4.9 L/h.MetabolismTrametinib is metabolized predominantly via deacetylation alone or with mono-oxygenation or in combination with glucuronidation biotransformation pathways in vitro. Deacetylation is mediated by carboxylesterases (i.e., carboxylesterase 1b/c and 2) and may also be mediated by other hydrolytic enzymes.Following a single dose of [14C]-trametinib, approximately 50% of circulating radioactivity is represented as the parent compound. However, based on metabolite profiling after repeat dosing of trametinib, ≥ 75% of drug-related material in plasma is the parent compound.ExcretionFollowing oral administration of [14C]-trametinib, greater than 80% of excreted radioactivity was recovered in the feces while less than 20% of excreted radioactivity was recovered in the urine with less than 0.1% of the excreted dose as parent.Specific PopulationsAge, sex, and body weight do not have a clinically important effect on the exposure of trametinib. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the exposure of trametinib by race or ethnicity.Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 64 patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5x ULN and any AST), mild hepatic impairment has no clinically important effect on the systemic exposure of trametinib. The pharmacokinetics of trametinib have not been studied in patients with moderate (bilirubin > 1.5x to 3x ULN and any AST) or severe (bilirubin > 3x to 10x ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment.Patients with Renal Impairment: Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 223 patients with mild renal impairment (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 35 patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2), mild and moderate renal impairment have no clinically important effects on the systemic exposure of trametinib. The pharmacokinetics of trametinib have not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Drug Interaction StudiesEffect of Dabrafenib on Trametinib: Coadministration of trametinib 2 mg daily with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily resulted in no change in AUC of trametinib as compared with administration of trametinib.Effect of Trametinib on CYP Substrates: Based on in vitro studies, trametinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, but is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 at a clinically relevant systemic concentration of 0.04 µM. Trametinib is an inducer of CYP3A in vitro. Based on cross-study comparisons, oral administration of MEKINIST 2 mg once daily with a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate had no clinically important effect on the AUC and Cmax of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate.Effect of Transporters on Trametinib: Trametinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BSEP. Inhibition of P-gp is unlikely to result in a clinically important increase in trametinib concentrations as trametinib exhibits high passive permeability and bioavailability. Trametinib is not a substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1, MRP2, or MATE1 in vitro.Effect of Trametinib on Transporters: Based on in vitro studies, trametinib is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, BSEP, MRP2, or MATE1 at a clinically relevant systemic concentration of 0.04 µM."

Trametinib was not genotoxic in studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells, and micronuclei in the bone marrow of rats.Trametinib may impair fertility in humans. In female rats given trametinib for up to 13 weeks, increased follicular cysts and decreased corpora lutea were observed at doses ≥ 0.016 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC). In rat and dog toxicity studies up to 13 weeks in duration, there were no treatment effects observed on male reproductive tissues [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]."

      "overdosage": [
        "10 OVERDOSAGEThe highest doses of MEKINIST evaluated in clinical trials were 4 mg orally once daily and 10 mg administered orally once daily on 2 consecutive days followed by 3 mg once daily. In seven patients treated on one of these two schedules, there were two cases of RPEDs for an incidence of 28%.Since trametinib is highly bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the treatment of overdose with MEKINIST."
