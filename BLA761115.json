        "11 DESCRIPTION Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is a Trop-2 directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, composed of the following three components: the humanized monoclonal antibody, hRS7 IgG1κ (also called sacituzumab), which binds to Trop-2 (the trophoblast cell-surface antigen-2); the drug SN-38, a topoisomerase inhibitor; a hydrolysable linker (called CL2A), which links the humanized monoclonal antibody to SN-38. The recombinant monoclonal antibody is produced by mammalian (murine myeloma) cells, while the small molecule components SN-38 and CL2A are produced by chemical synthesis. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy contains on average 7 to 8 molecules of SN-38 per antibody molecule. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy has a molecular weight of approximately 160 kilodaltons. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy has the following chemical structure. TRODELVY (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) for injection is a sterile, preservative-free, off-white to yellowish lyophilized powder for intravenous use in a 50 mL clear glass single-dose vial, with a rubber stopper and crimp-sealed with an aluminum flip-off cap. Each single-dose vial of TRODELVY delivers 180 mg sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, 77.3 mg 2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid (MES), 1.8 mg polysorbate 80, and 154 mg trehalose dihydrate. Reconstitution with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, results in a concentration of 10 mg/mL with a pH of 6.5. Chemical Structure"

      "mechanism_of_action": [
        "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is a Trop-2-directed antibody-drug conjugate. Sacituzumab is a humanized antibody that recognizes Trop-2. The small molecule, SN-38, is a topoisomerase I inhibitor, which is covalently attached to the antibody by a linker. Pharmacology data suggest that sacituzumab govitecan-hziy binds to Trop-2-expressing cancer cells and is internalized with the subsequent release of SN-38 via hydrolysis of the linker. SN-38 interacts with topoisomerase I and prevents re-ligation of topoisomerase I-induced single strand breaks. The resulting DNA damage leads to apoptosis and cell death. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy decreased tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of triple-negative breast cancer."

The pharmacokinetic parameters of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy and free SN-38 are presented in Table 6. Table 6: Summary of Mean PK Parameters (CV%) of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy and Free SN-38 Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy Free SN-38 C max : maximum plasma concentration AUC 0–168 : area under plasma concentration curve through 168 hours C max [ng/mL] 240000 (22.2%) 90.6 (65.0%) AUC 0–168 [ng*h/mL] 5340000 (23.7%) 2730 (41.1%) Distribution Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the central volume distribution of sacituzumab govetican-hziy is 2.96 L. Elimination The mean half-life of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy and free SN-38 is 15.3 and 19.7 hours, respectively. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the clearance of the sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is 0.14 L/h. Metabolism No metabolism studies with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy have been conducted. SN-38 (the small molecule moiety of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) is metabolized via UGT1A1. The glucuronide metabolite of SN-38 (SN-38G) was detectable in the serum of patients. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetic analyses in patients treated with TRODELVY (n=527) did not identify an effect of age, race, or mild renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. Renal elimination is known to contribute minimally to the excretion of SN-38, the small molecule moiety of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. There are no data on the pharmacokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy in patients with moderate renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (CLcr ≤30 mL/min). The exposure of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is similar in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN, or bilirubin >1.0 to <1.5 ULN and AST of any level; n=59) to patients with normal hepatic function (bilirubin or AST <ULN; n=191). Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy exposure is unknown in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. SN-38 exposure may be elevated in such patients due to decreased hepatic UGT1A1 activity. Drug Interaction Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy or its components. Inhibitors or inducers of UGT1A1 are expected to increase or decrease SN-38 exposure, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, TRODELVY can cause teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal lethality when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. TRODELVY contains a genotoxic component, SN-38, and is toxic to rapidly dividing cells [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4% and 15 – 20%, respectively.

Initiate anti-infective treatment in patient with febrile neutropenia without delay [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Severe diarrhea may occur. Monitor patients with diarrhea and give fluid and electrolytes as needed. Administer atropine, if not contraindicated, for early diarrhea of any severity. At the onset of late diarrhea, evaluate for infectious causes and, if negative, promptly initiate loperamide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. If severe diarrhea occurs, withhold TRODELVY until resolved to ≤ Grade 1 and reduce subsequent doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ].

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity and Infusion-Related Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic reactions have been observed. Monitor patients for infusion-related reactions. Permanently discontinue TRODELVY if severe or life-threatening reactions occur. ( 5.3 ) Nausea/Vomiting: Use antiemetic preventive treatment and withhold TRODELVY for patients with Grade 3 nausea or Grade 3–4 vomiting at the time of scheduled treatment. ( 5.4 ) Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity: Individuals who are homozygous for the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1)*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and anemia following initiation of TRODELVY treatment. ( 5.5 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: TRODELVY can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Neutropenia TRODELVY can cause severe or life-threatening neutropenia that may result in death. Neutropenia occurred in 62% of patients treated with TRODELVY, leading to permanent discontinuation of TRODELVY in 0.5% of patients. Grade 3–4 neutropenia occurred in 47% of patients. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 6% of patients. Withhold TRODELVY for absolute neutrophil count below 1500/mm 3 on Day 1 of any cycle or neutrophil count below 1000/mm 3 on Day 8 of any cycle. Withhold TRODELVY for neutropenic fever. Dose modifications may be required due to neutropenia. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.2 Diarrhea TRODELVY can cause severe diarrhea. Diarrhea occurred in 64% of all patients treated with TRODELVY. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 12% of all patients treated with TRODELVY. Neutropenic colitis occurred in 0.5% of patients. Withhold TRODELVY for Grade 3–4 diarrhea at the time of scheduled treatment administration and resume when resolved to ≤Grade 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. At the onset of diarrhea, evaluate for infectious causes and if negative, promptly initiate loperamide, 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg with every episode of diarrhea for a maximum of 16 mg daily. Discontinue loperamide 12 hours after diarrhea resolves. Additional supportive measures (e.g., fluid and electrolyte substitution) may also be employed as clinically indicated. Patients who exhibit an excessive cholinergic response to treatment with TRODELVY (e.g., abdominal cramping, diarrhea, salivation, etc.) can receive appropriate premedication (e.g., atropine) for subsequent treatments. 5.3 Hypersensitivity and Infusion-Related Reactions TRODELVY can cause severe and life-threatening hypersensitivity. Anaphylactic reactions have been observed in clinical trials with TRODELVY [see Contraindications (4) ] . Hypersensitivity reactions within 24 hours of dosing occurred in 37% of patients treated with TRODELVY. Grade 3–4 hypersensitivity occurred in 1% of patients treated with TRODELVY. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of TRODELVY was 0.4%. Pre-infusion medication for patients receiving TRODELVY is recommended . Observe patients closely for hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions during each TRODELVY infusion and for at least 30 minutes after completion of each infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Medication to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use. 5.4 Nausea and Vomiting TRODELVY is emetogenic. Nausea occurred in 67% of all patients treated with TRODELVY. Grade 3–4 nausea occurred in 5% of patients. Vomiting occurred 40% of all patients treated with TRODELVY. Grade 3–4 vomiting occurred in 3% of these patients. Premedicate with a two or three drug combination regimen (e.g., dexamethasone with either a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist or an NK 1 receptor antagonist as well as other drugs as indicated) for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Withhold TRODELVY doses for Grade 3 nausea or Grade 3–4 vomiting at the time of scheduled treatment administration and resume with additional supportive measures when resolved to ≤Grade 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Additional antiemetics and other supportive measures may also be employed as clinically indicated. All patients should be given take-home medications with clear instructions for prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting. 5.5 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions in Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity Patients homozygous for the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1)*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and anemia; and may be at increased risk for other adverse reactions when treated with TRODELVY. The incidence of neutropenia and anemia was analyzed in 577 patients who received TRODELVY and had UGT1A1 genotype results. In patients homozygous for the UGT1A1 *28 allele (n=70), the incidence of Grade 3–4 neutropenia was 69%. In patients heterozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (n=246), the incidence of Grade 3–4 neutropenia was 48%. In patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (n=261), the incidence of Grade 3–4 neutropenia was 46% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . In patients homozygous for the UGT1A1 *28 allele (n=70), the incidence of Grade 3–4 anemia was 24%. In patients heterozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (n=246), the incidence of Grade 3–4 anemia was 8%. In patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (n=261), the incidence of Grade 3–4 anemia was 10%. Closely monitor patients with known reduced UGT1A1 activity for adverse reactions. Withhold or permanently discontinue TRODELVY based on severity of the observed adverse reactions in patients with evidence of acute early-onset or unusually severe adverse reactions, which may indicate UGT1A1 reduced function [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, TRODELVY can cause teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal lethality when administered to a pregnant woman. TRODELVY contains a genotoxic component, SN-38, and targets rapidly dividing cells [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRODELVY and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRODELVY and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. The recommended dose is 10 mg/kg once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of continuous 21-day treatment cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ( 2.2 ) Premedication for prevention of infusion reactions and prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is recommended. ( 2.2 ) Monitor patients during the infusion and for at least 30 minutes after completion of infusion. Treatment interruption and/or dose reduction may be needed to manage adverse reactions. ( 2.2 ) See Full Prescribing Information for preparation and administration instructions. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Use Information Do NOT substitute TRODELVY for or use with other drugs containing irinotecan or its active metabolite SN-38. 2.2 Recommended Dose and Schedule The recommended dose of TRODELVY is 10 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day treatment cycles. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Do not administer TRODELVY at doses greater than 10 mg/kg. Administer TRODELVY as an intravenous infusion only. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. First infusion: Administer infusion over 3 hours. Observe patients during the infusion and for at least 30 minutes following the initial dose, for signs or symptoms of infusion-related reactions [see Warning and Precautions (5.3) ] . Subsequent infusions: Administer infusion over 1 to 2 hours if prior infusions were tolerated. Observe patients during the infusion and for at least 30 minutes after infusion. Premedication Prior to each dose of TRODELVY, premedication for prevention of infusion reactions and prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is recommended. Premedicate with antipyretics, H1 and H2 blockers prior to infusion, and corticosteroids may be used for patients who had prior infusion reactions. Premedicate with a two or three drug combination regimen (e.g., dexamethasone with either a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist or an NK 1 receptor antagonist, as well as other drugs as indicated). 2.3 Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions Infusion-related Reactions Slow or interrupt the infusion rate of TRODELVY if the patient develops an infusion-related reaction. Permanently discontinue TRODELVY for life-threatening infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions Withhold or discontinue TRODELVY to manage adverse reactions as described in Table 1. Do not re-escalate the TRODELVY dose after a dose reduction for adverse reactions has been made. Table 1: Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction Occurrence Dose Modification Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Grade 4 neutropenia ≥7 days, OR First 25% dose reduction and administer granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) Grade 3 febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 and fever ≥38.5°C), Second 50% dose reduction OR At time of scheduled treatment, Grade 3–4 neutropenia which delays dosing by 2 or 3 weeks for recovery to ≤Grade 1 Third Discontinue treatment At time of scheduled treatment, Grade 3–4 neutropenia which delays dosing beyond 3 weeks for recovery to ≤Grade 1 First Discontinue treatment Severe Non-Neutropenic Toxicity Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity of any duration, First 25% dose reduction OR Any Grade 3–4 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea due to treatment that is not controlled with antiemetics and anti-diarrheal agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.4) ] , Second 50% dose reduction OR Other Grade 3–4 non-hematologic toxicity persisting >48 hours despite optimal medical management, OR At time of scheduled treatment, Grade 3–4 non-neutropenic hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity, which delays dose by 2 or 3 weeks for recovery to ≤Grade 1 Third Discontinue treatment In the event of Grade 3–4 non-neutropenic hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity, which does not recover to ≤Grade 1 within 3 weeks First Discontinue treatment 2.4 Preparation for Administration Reconstitution TRODELVY is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 . Calculate the required dose (mg) of TRODELVY based on the patient's body weight at the beginning of each treatment cycle (or more frequently if the patient's body weight changed by more than 10% since the previous administration) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Allow the required number of vials to warm to room temperature. Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, into each 180 mg TRODELVY vial. The resulting concentration will be 10 mg/mL. Gently swirl vials and allow to dissolve for up to 15 minutes. Do not shake. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution should be free of visible particulates, clear and yellow. Do not use the reconstituted solution if it is cloudy or discolored. Use immediately to prepare a diluted TRODELVY infusion solution. Dilution Calculate the required volume of the reconstituted TRODELVY solution needed to obtain the appropriate dose according to patient's body weight. Withdraw this amount from the vial(s) using a syringe. Discard any unused portion remaining in the vial(s). Adjust the volume in the infusion bag as needed with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to obtain a concentration of 1.1 mg/mL to 3.4 mg/mL (total volume should not exceed 500 mL). For patients whose body weight exceeds 170 kg, divide the total dosage of TRODELVY equally between two 500 mL infusion bags and infuse sequentially via slow infusion. Slowly inject the required volume of reconstituted TRODELVY solution into a polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene or ethylene/propylene copolymer infusion bag, to minimize foaming. Do not shake the contents. Only 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, should be used since the stability of the reconstituted product has not been determined with other infusion-based solutions. Use the diluted solution in the infusion bag immediately. If not used immediately, the infusion bag containing TRODELVY solution can be stored refrigerated 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 4 hours. After refrigeration, administer diluted solution within 4 hours (including infusion time). Do Not Freeze or Shake. Protect from Light. Administration Administer TRODELVY as an intravenous infusion. Protect infusion bag from light. An infusion pump may be used. Do not mix TRODELVY, or administer as an infusion, with other medicinal products. Upon completion of the infusion, flush the intravenous line with 20 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypersensitivity and Infusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥25%) are nausea, neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, alopecia, anemia, vomiting, constipation, rash, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Immunomedics, Inc. at 1-888-983-4668 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The pooled safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to TRODELVY as a single agent in 660 patients from two studies, IMMU-132-01 and IMMU-132-05 which included 366 patients with mTNBC who had received prior systemic chemotherapy for advanced disease. TRODELVY was administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day treatment cycles at doses of 10 mg/kg until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among the 660 patients treated with TRODELVY, the median duration of treatment was 4.1 months (range: 0 to 51 months). In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥ 25%) adverse reactions were nausea, neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, alopecia, anemia, vomiting, constipation, rash, decreased appetite and abdominal pain. ASCENT Study The safety of TRODELVY was evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial (ASCENT) in patients with mTNBC who had previously received a taxane and at least two prior therapies. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either TRODELVY (n=258) or single agent chemotherapy (n=224) and were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . For patients treated with TRODELVY, the median duration of treatment was 4.4 months (range: 0 to 23 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 27% of patients receiving TRODELVY. Serious adverse reactions in > 1% of patients receiving TRODELVY included neutropenia (7%), diarrhea (4%), and pneumonia (3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.2% of patients who received TRODELVY, including respiratory failure (0.8%) and pneumonia (0.4%). TRODELVY was permanently discontinued for adverse reactions in 5% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in ≥ 1 % of patients who received TRODELVY were pneumonia (1%) and fatigue (1%). Adverse reactions leading to a treatment interruption of TRODELVY occurred in 63% of patients. The most frequent (≥5%) adverse reactions leading to a treatment interruption were neutropenia (47%), diarrhea (5%), respiratory infection (5%), and leukopenia (5%). Adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction of TRODELVY occurred in 22% of patients. The most frequent (>4%) adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction were neutropenia (11%) and diarrhea (5%). Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used in 44% of patients who received TRODELVY. Tables 2 and 3 summarize adverse reactions and select laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in the ASCENT study.

TRODELVY was administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly on Days 1 and 8 of 21-day treatment cycles at doses up to 10 mg/kg until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median treatment duration in these 108 patients was 5.1 months (range: 0–51 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 31% of the patients. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients receiving TRODELVY included febrile neutropenia (6%) vomiting (5%), nausea (3%), dyspnea (3%), diarrhea (4%), anemia (2%), pleural effusion, neutropenia, pneumonia, dehydration (each 2%). TRODELVY was permanently discontinued for adverse reactions in 2% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation were anaphylaxis, anorexia/fatigue, headache (each 0.9%). Forty- five percent (45%) of patients experienced an adverse reaction leading to treatment interruption. The most common adverse reaction leading to treatment interruption was neutropenia (33%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 33% of patients treated with TRODELVY, with 24% having one dose reduction, and 9% with two dose reductions. The most common adverse reaction leading to dose reductions was neutropenia/febrile neutropenia.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other sacituzumab govitecan products may be misleading. The analysis of immunogenicity of TRODELVY in serum samples from 106 patients with mTNBC was evaluated using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to test for anti-sacituzumab govitecan-hziy antibodies. Detection of the anti-sacituzumab govitecan-hziy antibodies was done using a 3-tier approach: screen, confirm, and titer. Persistent anti-sacituzumab govitecan-hziy antibodies developed in 2% (2/106) of patients."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, TRODELVY can cause teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal lethality when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. TRODELVY contains a genotoxic component, SN-38, and is toxic to rapidly dividing cells [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4% and 15 – 20%, respectively. Data Animal data There were no reproductive and developmental toxicology studies conducted with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy or SN-38 in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 month after the last dose of TRODELVY. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of TRODELVY. Contraception Females TRODELVY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRODELVY and for 6 months after the last dose. Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRODELVY and for 3 months after the last dose. Infertility Females Based on findings in animals, TRODELVY may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of TRODELVY have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the patients who received TRODELVY, 28% of all patients were ≥65 years old. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No adjustment to the starting dose is required when administering TRODELVY to patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤1.5 ULN and AST/ALT <3 ULN). The exposure of TRODELVY in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN, or bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 ULN and AST of any level; n=59 was similar to patients with normal hepatic function (bilirubin or AST <ULN; n=191). The safety of TRODELVY in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment has not been established. TRODELVY has not been tested in patients with serum bilirubin > 1.5 ULN, or AST and ALT > 3 ULN, or AST and ALT > 5 ULN and associated with liver metastases. No dedicated trial was performed to investigate the tolerability of TRODELVY in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. No recommendations can be made for the starting dose in these patients."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES ASCENT Efficacy was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, randomized study (ASCENT; NCT02574455) conducted in 529 patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who had relapsed after at least two prior chemotherapies for breast cancer (one of which could be in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting provided progression occurred within a 12 month period). All patients received previous taxane treatment in either the adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or advanced stage unless there was a contraindication or intolerance to taxanes during or at the end of the first taxane cycle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine brain metastases was required prior to enrollment for patients with known or suspected brain metastases. Patients with brain metastases were allowed to enroll up to a pre-defined maximum of 15% of patients in the ASCENT trial. Patients with known Gilbert's disease or bone-only disease were excluded. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive TRODELVY 10 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day (n=267) or physician's choice of single agent chemotherapy (n=262). Single agent chemotherapy was determined by the investigator before randomization from one of the following choices: eribulin (n=139), capecitabine (n=33), gemcitabine (n=38), or vinorelbine (n=52). Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) in patients without brain metastases at baseline (i.e., BMNeg) as measured by a blinded, independent, centralized review assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. Additional efficacy measures included PFS for the full population (all patients with and without brain metastases) and overall survival (OS). The median age of patients in the full population (n = 529) was 54 years (range: 27–82 years); 99.6% were female; 79% were White, 12% were Black/African American; and 81% of patients were < 65 years of age. All patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (43%) or 1 (57%). Forty-two percent of patients had hepatic metastases, 9% were BRCA1/BRCA2 mutational status positive, and 70% were TNBC at diagnosis. Twelve percent had baseline brain metastases previously treated and stable (n=61; 32 on TRODELVY arm and 29 on single agent chemotherapy arm). Overall, 29% of patients had received prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Thirteen percent of patients in the TRODELVY group in the full population received only 1 prior line of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting. The efficacy results are summarized in Table 7 and are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Efficacy results for the subgroup of patients who had received only 1 prior line of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting (in addition to having disease recurrence or progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant/adjvuant systemic therapy) were consistent with those who had received at least two prior lines in the metastatic setting.

The median PFS in the TRODELVY arm was 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.5, 3.9) and the median PFS with single agent chemotherapy was 1.6 months (95% CI: 1.3, 2.9). Exploratory OS analysis in the same population showed a stratified HR of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.63). The median OS in the TRODELVY arm was 6.8 months (95% CI: 4.7, 14.1) and the median OS with single agent chemotherapy was 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.7, 11.1). Figure 1 Figure 2 IMMU-132-01 (NCT01631552) The efficacy of TRODELVY was evaluated in a multicenter, single-arm, trial that enrolled 108 patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who had received at least two prior treatments for metastatic disease. Patients with bulky disease, defined as a mass >7 cm, were not eligible. Patients with treated brain metastases not receiving high dose steroids (>20 mg prednisone or equivalent) for at least four weeks were eligible. Patients with known Gilbert's disease were excluded. Patients received TRODELVY 10 mg/kg intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment cycle. Patients were treated with TRODELVY until disease progression or intolerance to the therapy. Tumor imaging was obtained every 8 weeks, with confirmatory CT/MRI scans obtained 4–6 weeks after an initial partial or complete response, until progression requiring treatment discontinuation. Major efficacy outcome measures were investigator assessed overall response rate (ORR) using RECIST 1.1 and duration of response. The median age was 55 years (range: 31 – 80 years); 87% of patients were younger than 65 years. The majority of patients were female (99%) and White (76%). At study entry, all patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 (29%) or 1 (71%). Seventy-six percent had visceral disease, 42% had hepatic metastases, 56% had lung/pleura metastases, and 2% had brain metastases. Twelve patients (11%) had Stage IV disease at the time of initial diagnosis. The median number of prior systemic therapies received in the metastatic setting was 3 (range: 2 – 10). Prior chemotherapies in the metastatic setting included carboplatin or cisplatin (69%), gemcitabine (55%), paclitaxel or docetaxel (53%), capecitabine (51%), eribulin (45%), doxorubicin (24%), vinorelbine (16%), cyclophosphamide (19%), and ixabepilone (8%). Overall, 98% of patients had received prior taxanes and 86% had received prior anthracyclines either in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting. Table 8 summarizes the efficacy results.

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is a Trop-2-directed antibody-drug conjugate. Sacituzumab is a humanized antibody that recognizes Trop-2. The small molecule, SN-38, is a topoisomerase I inhibitor, which is covalently attached to the antibody by a linker. Pharmacology data suggest that sacituzumab govitecan-hziy binds to Trop-2-expressing cancer cells and is internalized with the subsequent release of SN-38 via hydrolysis of the linker. SN-38 interacts with topoisomerase I and prevents re-ligation of topoisomerase I-induced single strand breaks. The resulting DNA damage leads to apoptosis and cell death. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy decreased tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of triple-negative breast cancer. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The TRODELVY exposure-response relationships and pharmacodynamic time-course for efficacy have not been fully characterized. Cardiac electrophysiology The maximum mean change from baseline was 9.7 msec (the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval is 16.8 msec) at the recommended dose. A positive exposure-response relationship was observed between QTc increases and SN-38 concentrations. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The serum pharmacokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy and SN-38 were evaluated in study IMMU132-05 in a population of mTNBC patients who received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy as a single agent at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The pharmacokinetic parameters of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy and free SN-38 are presented in Table 6. Table 6: Summary of Mean PK Parameters (CV%) of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy and Free SN-38 Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy Free SN-38 C max : maximum plasma concentration AUC 0–168 : area under plasma concentration curve through 168 hours C max [ng/mL] 240000 (22.2%) 90.6 (65.0%) AUC 0–168 [ng*h/mL] 5340000 (23.7%) 2730 (41.1%) Distribution Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the central volume distribution of sacituzumab govetican-hziy is 2.96 L. Elimination The mean half-life of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy and free SN-38 is 15.3 and 19.7 hours, respectively. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the clearance of the sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is 0.14 L/h. Metabolism No metabolism studies with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy have been conducted. SN-38 (the small molecule moiety of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) is metabolized via UGT1A1. The glucuronide metabolite of SN-38 (SN-38G) was detectable in the serum of patients. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetic analyses in patients treated with TRODELVY (n=527) did not identify an effect of age, race, or mild renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. Renal elimination is known to contribute minimally to the excretion of SN-38, the small molecule moiety of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. There are no data on the pharmacokinetics of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy in patients with moderate renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (CLcr ≤30 mL/min). The exposure of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is similar in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN, or bilirubin >1.0 to <1.5 ULN and AST of any level; n=59) to patients with normal hepatic function (bilirubin or AST <ULN; n=191). Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy exposure is unknown in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. SN-38 exposure may be elevated in such patients due to decreased hepatic UGT1A1 activity. Drug Interaction Studies No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with sacituzumab govitecan-hziy or its components. Inhibitors or inducers of UGT1A1 are expected to increase or decrease SN-38 exposure, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics SN-38 is metabolized via UGT1A1 [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Genetic variants of the UGT1A1 gene such as the UGT1A1*28 allele lead to reduced UGT1A1 enzyme activity. Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and anemia from TRODELVY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Approximately 20% of the Black or African American population, 10% of the White population, and 2% of the East Asian population are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. Decreased function alleles other than UGT1A1*28 may be present in certain populations."
