Its use is therefore not recommended in children less than 6 months of age with any of the following: Less than 37 weeks of gestation at birth Less than 10 days of oral feeding Body weight of less than 2.6 kg. To increase absorption, all doses should be taken with feeding or with food. Monitor the child's weight and review the dose regularly, especially for children below 12 kg. This is to ensure a therapeutic dose is maintained. All pediatric patients (except <2 years old with catheter-related thrombosis): Therapy with XARELTO should be continued for at least 3 months in children with thrombosis. Treatment can be extended up to 12 months when clinically necessary. The benefit of continued therapy beyond 3 months should be assessed on an individual basis taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the potential risk of bleeding. Pediatric patients <2 years old with catheter-related thrombosis: Therapy with XARELTO should be continued for at least 1 month in children less than 2 years old with catheter-related thrombosis. Treatment can be extended up to 3 months when clinically necessary. The benefit of continued therapy beyond 1 month should be assessed on an individual basis taking into account the risk for recurrent thrombosis versus the potential risk of bleeding. Thromboprophylaxis in Pediatric Patients with Congenital Heart Disease after the Fontan Procedure Table 3: Recommended Dosage for Thromboprophylaxis in Pediatric Patients with Congenital Heart Disease Dosage Form Body Weight 1 mg XARELTO = 1 mL Suspension Dosage Total Daily Dose All doses can be taken with or without food since exposures match that of 10 mg daily dose in adults.

For thromboprophylaxis after Fontan procedure, the dose can be taken with or without food. Vomit or Spit up: If the patient vomits or spits up the dose within 30 minutes after receiving the dose, a new dose should be given. However, if the patient vomits more than 30 minutes after the dose is taken, the dose should not be re-administered and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. If the patient vomits or spits up the dose repeatedly, the caregiver should contact the child's doctor right away. Tablets: XARELTO tablet must not be split in an attempt to provide a fraction of a tablet dose. For children unable to swallow 10, 15, or 20 mg whole tablets, XARELTO oral suspension should be used. XARELTO 2.5 mg tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Use in Renal Impairment in Pediatric Patients Patients 1 Year of Age or Older Mild renal impairment (eGFR: 50 to ≤ 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ): No dose adjustment is required. Moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR: <50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ): avoid use, as limited clinical data are available. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be done using the updated Schwartz formula, eGFR (Schwartz) = (0.413 × height in cm)/serum creatinine in mg/dL, if serum creatinine (SCr) is measured by an enzymatic creatinine method that has been calibrated to be traceable to isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS). If SCr is measured with routine methods that have not been recalibrated to be traceable to IDMS (e.g., the traditional Jaffé reaction), the eGFR should be obtained from the original Schwartz formula: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) = k * height (cm)/SCr (mg/dL), where k is proportionality constant: k = 0.55 in children 1 year to 13 years k = 0.55 in girls > 13 and < 18 years k = 0.70 in boys > 13 and < 18 years Patients Less than 1 Year of Age Determine renal function using serum creatinine. Avoid use of XARELTO in pediatric patients younger than 1 year with serum creatinine results above 97.5 th percentile, as no clinical data are available. Table 4: Reference Values of Serum Creatinine in Pediatric Patients <1 Year of Age Age 97.5 th Percentile of Creatinine (mg/dL) 97.5 th Percentile of Creatinine (µmol/L) Week 2 0.52 46 Week 3 0.46 41 Week 4 0.42 37 Month 2 0.37 33 Month 3 0.34 30 Month 4–6 0.34 30 Month 7–9 0.34 30 Month 10–12 0.36 32 2.3 Switching to and from XARELTO Switching from Warfarin to XARELTO - When switching patients from warfarin to XARELTO, discontinue warfarin and start XARELTO as soon as the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is below 3.0 in adults and below 2.5 in pediatric patients to avoid periods of inadequate anticoagulation. Switching from XARELTO to Warfarin – Adults: No clinical trial data are available to guide converting patients from XARELTO to warfarin. XARELTO affects INR, so INR measurements made during coadministration with warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue XARELTO and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of XARELTO would have been taken. Pediatric Patients: To ensure adequate anticoagulation during the transition from XARELTO to warfarin, continue XARELTO for at least 2 days after the first dose of warfarin. After 2 days of co-administration, an INR should be obtained prior to the next scheduled dose of XARELTO. Co-administration of XARELTO and warfarin is advised to continue until the INR is ≥ 2.0. Once XARELTO is discontinued, INR testing may be done reliably 24 hours after the last dose. Switching from XARELTO to Anticoagulants other than Warfarin - For adult and pediatric patients currently taking XARELTO and transitioning to an anticoagulant with rapid onset, discontinue XARELTO and give the first dose of the other anticoagulant (oral or parenteral) at the time that the next XARELTO dose would have been taken [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Switching from Anticoagulants other than Warfarin to XARELTO - For adult and pediatric patients currently receiving an anticoagulant other than warfarin, start XARELTO 0 to 2 hours prior to the next scheduled administration of the drug (e.g., low molecular weight heparin or non-warfarin oral anticoagulant) and omit administration of the other anticoagulant. For unfractionated heparin being administered by continuous infusion, stop the infusion and start XARELTO at the same time. 2.4 Discontinuation for Surgery and other Interventions If anticoagulation must be discontinued to reduce the risk of bleeding with surgical or other procedures, XARELTO should be stopped at least 24 hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In deciding whether a procedure should be delayed until 24 hours after the last dose of XARELTO, the increased risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. XARELTO should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established, noting that the time to onset of therapeutic effect is short [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If oral medication cannot be taken during or after surgical intervention, consider administering a parenteral anticoagulant. 2.5 Missed Dose Adults For patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily: if a dose is missed, the patient should take a single 2.5 mg XARELTO dose as recommended at the next scheduled time. For patients receiving 15 mg twice daily: The patient should take XARELTO immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg XARELTO per day. Two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once. For patients receiving 20 mg, 15 mg or 10 mg once daily: The patient should take the missed XARELTO dose immediately. The dose should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose. Pediatric Patients If XARELTO is taken once a day, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible once it is noticed, but only on the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as prescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose. If XARELTO is taken two times a day, the patient should take the missed morning dose as soon as possible once it is noticed. A missed morning dose may be taken together with the evening dose. A missed evening dose can only be taken in the same evening. If XARELTO is taken three times a day, if a dose is missed, the patient should skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule at the usual time without compensating for the missed dose. On the following day, the patient should continue with their regular regimen. 2.6 Administration Options For adult patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, XARELTO tablets (all strengths) may be crushed and mixed with applesauce immediately prior to use and administered orally. After the administration of a crushed XARELTO 15 mg or 20 mg tablet, the dose should be immediately followed by food. Administration with food is not required for the 2.5 mg or 10 mg tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Administration of XARELTO tablets via nasogastric (NG) tube or gastric feeding tube: After confirming gastric placement of the tube, XARELTO tablets (all strengths) may be crushed and suspended in 50 mL of water and administered via an NG tube or gastric feeding tube. Since rivaroxaban absorption is dependent on the site of drug release, avoid administration of XARELTO distal to the stomach which can result in reduced absorption and thereby, reduced drug exposure. After the administration of a crushed XARELTO 15 mg or 20 mg tablet, the dose should then be immediately followed by enteral feeding. Enteral feeding is not required following administration of the 2.5 mg or 10 mg tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Crushed XARELTO tablets (all strengths) are stable in water and in applesauce for up to 4 hours. An in vitro compatibility study indicated that there is no adsorption of rivaroxaban from a water suspension of a crushed XARELTO tablet to PVC or silicone nasogastric (NG) tubing. Administration of XARELTO suspension via NG tube or gastric feeding tube : XARELTO oral suspension may be given through NG or gastric feeding tube. After the administration, flush the feeding tube with water. For the treatment or reduction in risk of recurrent VTE in pediatric patients, the dose should then be immediately followed by enteral feeding to increase absorption. For the thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease who have undergone the Fontan procedure, the dose does not require to be followed by enteral feeding. An in vitro compatibility study indicated that XARELTO suspension can be used with PVC, polyurethane or silicone NG tubing. 2.7 Preparation Instructions for Pharmacy of XARELTO for Oral Suspension Do not add flavor as product is already flavored (sweet and creamy).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of bleeding: XARELTO can cause serious and fatal bleeding. An agent to reverse the activity of rivaroxaban is available. ( 5.2 ) Pregnancy-related hemorrhage: Use XARELTO with caution in pregnant women due to the potential for obstetric hemorrhage and/or emergent delivery. ( 5.7 , 8.1 ) Prosthetic heart valves: XARELTO use not recommended. ( 5.8 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome: XARELTO use not recommended. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from XARELTO to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . 5.2 Risk of Bleeding XARELTO increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious or fatal bleeding. In deciding whether to prescribe XARELTO to patients at increased risk of bleeding, the risk of thrombotic events should be weighed against the risk of bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss and consider the need for blood replacement. Discontinue XARELTO in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years. Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin, P2Y 12 platelet inhibitors, dual antiplatelet therapy, other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Concomitant use of drugs that are known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increases rivaroxaban exposure and may increase bleeding risk [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Risk of Hemorrhage in Acutely Ill Medical Patients at High Risk of Bleeding Acutely ill medical patients with the following conditions are at increased risk of bleeding with the use of XARELTO for primary VTE prophylaxis: history of bronchiectasis, pulmonary cavitation, or pulmonary hemorrhage, active cancer (i.e., undergoing acute, in-hospital cancer treatment), active gastroduodenal ulcer in the three months prior to treatment, history of bleeding in the three months prior to treatment, or dual antiplatelet therapy. XARELTO is not for use for primary VTE prophylaxis in these hospitalized, acutely ill medical patients at high risk of bleeding. Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of rivaroxaban is available. Because of high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not dialyzable [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. Use of procoagulant reversal agents, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa, may be considered but has not been evaluated in clinical efficacy and safety studies. Monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of rivaroxaban using a clotting test (PT, INR or aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity is not recommended. 5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal puncture is employed, patients treated with anticoagulant agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis [see Boxed Warning ] . To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of XARELTO and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of XARELTO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of XARELTO is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. An indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheter should not be removed before at least 2 half-lives have elapsed (i.e., 18 hours in young patients aged 20 to 45 years and 26 hours in elderly patients aged 60 to 76 years), after the last administration of XARELTO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The next XARELTO dose should not be administered earlier than 6 hours after the removal of the catheter. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of XARELTO for 24 hours. Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, monitor frequently to detect any signs or symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to immediately report if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae. 5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in situations in which renal function may decline) and adjust therapy accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on XARELTO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and of PE In patients with CrCl <30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function. There are limited clinical data in patients with CrCl 15 to <30 mL/min; therefore, observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in these patients. There are no clinical data in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min (including patients on dialysis); therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients. Discontinue XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery In patients with CrCl <30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function. There are limited clinical data in patients with CrCl 15 to <30 mL/min; therefore, observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in these patients. There are no clinical data in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min (including patients on dialysis); therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients. Discontinue XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Acutely Ill Medical Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications Not at High Risk of Bleeding In patients with CrCl <30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function. There are limited clinical data in patients with CrCl 15 to <30 mL/min; therefore, observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in these patients. There are no clinical data in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min (including patients on dialysis); therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients. Discontinue XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Pediatric Patients There are limited clinical data in pediatric patients 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ); therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients. There are no clinical data in pediatric patients younger than 1 year with serum creatinine results above 97.5 th percentile; therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical data are available for adult patients with severe hepatic impairment. Avoid use of XARELTO in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment or with any hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy since drug exposure and bleeding risk may be increased [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . No clinical data are available in pediatric patients with hepatic impairment. 5.6 Use with P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors or Inducers Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with drugs that are known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 5.7 Risk of Pregnancy-Related Hemorrhage In pregnant women, XARELTO should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. XARELTO dosing in pregnancy has not been studied. The anticoagulant effect of XARELTO cannot be monitored with standard laboratory testing. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms suggesting blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, hypotension, or fetal distress) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.8 Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves On the basis of the GALILEO study, use of XARELTO is not recommended in patients who have had transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) because patients randomized to XARELTO experienced higher rates of death and bleeding compared to those randomized to an anti-platelet regimen. The safety and efficacy of XARELTO have not been studied in patients with other prosthetic heart valves or other valve procedures. Use of XARELTO is not recommended in patients with prosthetic heart valves. 5.9 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients Who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy Initiation of XARELTO is not recommended acutely as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary embolism who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy. 5.10 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including XARELTO, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy."

( 6.1 ) The most common adverse reactions (>10%) in pediatric patients were bleeding, cough, vomiting, and gastroenteritis. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-526-7736 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. During clinical development for the approved indications, 34,947 adult patients were exposed to XARELTO. Hemorrhage The most common adverse reactions with XARELTO were bleeding complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation In the ROCKET AF trial, the most frequent adverse reactions associated with permanent drug discontinuation were bleeding events, with incidence rates of 4.3% for XARELTO vs. 3.1% for warfarin. The incidence of discontinuations for non-bleeding adverse events was similar in both treatment groups. Table 5 shows the number of patients experiencing various types of bleeding events in the ROCKET AF trial. Table 5: Bleeding Events in ROCKET AF Major bleeding events within each subcategory were counted once per patient, but patients may have contributed events to multiple subcategories. These events occurred during treatment or within 2 days of stopping treatment. - On Treatment Plus 2 Days Parameter XARELTO N=7111 n (%/year) Warfarin N=7125 n (%/year) XARELTO vs. Warfarin HR (95% CI) Abbreviations: HR = Hazard Ratio, CI = Confidence interval, CRNM = Clinically Relevant Non-Major.

Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Acutely Ill Medical Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications Not at High Risk of Bleeding In the MAGELLAN study, the most frequent adverse reactions associated with permanent drug discontinuation were bleeding events. Cases of pulmonary hemorrhage and pulmonary hemorrhage with bronchiectasis were observed. Patients with bronchiectasis/pulmonary cavitation, active cancer (i.e., undergoing acute, in-hospital cancer treatment), dual antiplatelet therapy or active gastroduodenal ulcer or any bleeding in the previous three months all had an excess of bleeding with XARELTO compared with enoxaparin/placebo and are excluded from all MAGELLAN data presented in Table 9. The incidence of bleeding leading to drug discontinuation was 2.5% for XARELTO vs. 1.4% for enoxaparin/placebo. Table 9 shows the number of patients experiencing various types of bleeding events in the MAGELLAN study. Table 9: Bleeding Events in MAGELLAN Patients at high risk of bleeding (i.e. bronchiectasis/pulmonary cavitation, active cancer, dual antiplatelet therapy or active gastroduodenal ulcer or any bleeding in the previous three months) were excluded.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers ( 7.2 , 7.3 ) Anticoagulants: Avoid concomitant use ( 7.4 ) 7.1 General Inhibition and Induction Properties Rivaroxaban is a substrate of CYP3A4/5, CYP2J2, and the P-gp and ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) transporters. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increase exposure to rivaroxaban and may increase the risk of bleeding. Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers decrease exposure to rivaroxaban and may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 7.2 Drugs that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems Interaction with Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid concomitant administration of XARELTO with known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole and ritonavir) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggests that no precautions are necessary with concomitant administration with XARELTO as the change in exposure is unlikely to affect the bleeding risk [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Interaction with Combined P-gp and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors in Patients with Renal Impairment XARELTO should not be used in patients with CrCl 15 to <80 mL/min who are receiving concomitant combined P-gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Drugs that Induce Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.4 Anticoagulants and NSAIDs/Aspirin Coadministration of enoxaparin, warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel and chronic NSAID use may increase the risk of bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Avoid concurrent use of XARELTO with other anticoagulants due to increased bleeding risk unless benefit outweighs risk. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal impairment: Avoid or adjust dose ( 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: Avoid use in Child-Pugh B and C hepatic impairment or hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data on XARELTO in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Use XARELTO with caution in pregnant patients because of the potential for pregnancy related hemorrhage and/or emergent delivery. The anticoagulant effect of XARELTO cannot be reliably monitored with standard laboratory testing. Consider the benefits and risks of XARELTO for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing XARELTO to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.7) ] . Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Pregnancy is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and that risk is increased in women with inherited or acquired thrombophilias. Pregnant women with thromboembolic disease have an increased risk of maternal complications including pre-eclampsia. Maternal thromboembolic disease increases the risk for intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption and early and late pregnancy loss. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Based on the pharmacologic activity of Factor Xa inhibitors and the potential to cross the placenta, bleeding may occur at any site in the fetus and/or neonate. Labor or Delivery All patients receiving anticoagulants, including pregnant women, are at risk for bleeding and this risk may be increased during labor or delivery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. The risk of bleeding should be balanced with the risk of thrombotic events when considering the use of XARELTO in this setting. Data Human Data There are no adequate or well-controlled studies of XARELTO in pregnant women, and dosing for pregnant women has not been established. Post-marketing experience is currently insufficient to determine a rivaroxaban-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. In an in vitro placenta perfusion model, unbound rivaroxaban was rapidly transferred across the human placenta. Animal Data Rivaroxaban crosses the placenta in animals. Rivaroxaban increased fetal toxicity (increased resorptions, decreased number of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weight) when pregnant rabbits were given oral doses of ≥10 mg/kg rivaroxaban during the period of organogenesis. This dose corresponds to about 4 times the human exposure of unbound drug, based on AUC comparisons at the highest recommended human dose of 20 mg/day. Fetal body weights decreased when pregnant rats were given oral doses of 120 mg/kg during the period of organogenesis. This dose corresponds to about 14 times the human exposure of unbound drug. In rats, peripartal maternal bleeding and maternal and fetal death occurred at the rivaroxaban dose of 40 mg/kg (about 6 times maximum human exposure of the unbound drug at the human dose of 20 mg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Rivaroxaban has been detected in human milk. There are insufficient data to determine the effects of rivaroxaban on the breastfed child or on milk production. Rivaroxaban and/or its metabolites were present in the milk of rats. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for XARELTO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from XARELTO or from the underlying maternal condition (see Data ) . Data Animal Data Following a single oral administration of 3 mg/kg of radioactive [ 14 C]-rivaroxaban to lactating rats between Day 8 to 10 postpartum, the concentration of total radioactivity was determined in milk samples collected up to 32 hours post-dose. The estimated amount of radioactivity excreted with milk within 32 hours after administration was 2.1% of the maternal dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential requiring anticoagulation should discuss pregnancy planning with their physician. The risk of clinically significant uterine bleeding, potentially requiring gynecological surgical interventions, identified with oral anticoagulants including XARELTO should be assessed in females of reproductive potential and those with abnormal uterine bleeding. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of XARELTO have been established in pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years for the treatment of VTE and the reduction in risk of recurrent VTE. Use of XARELTO is supported in these age groups by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of XARELTO in adults with additional pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy data from a multicenter, prospective, open-label, active-controlled randomized study in 500 pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age. XARELTO was not studied and therefore dosing cannot be reliably determined or recommended in children less than 6 months who were less than 37 weeks of gestation at birth; had less than 10 days of oral feeding, or had a body weight of less than 2.6 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.8) ] . The safety and effectiveness of XARELTO have been established for use in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with congenital heart disease who have undergone the Fontan procedure. Use of XARELTO is supported in these age groups by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of XARELTO in adults with additional data from a multicenter, prospective, open-label, active controlled study in 112 pediatric patients to evaluate the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties of XARELTO and the safety and efficacy of XARELTO when used for thromboprophylaxis for 12 months in children with single ventricle physiology who had the Fontan procedure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.9) ] . Clinical studies that evaluated safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data support the use of XARELTO 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg tablets in pediatric patients. For the XARELTO 2.5 mg tablets, there are no safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to support the use in pediatric patients. Therefore, XARELTO 2.5 mg tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients. Although not all adverse reactions identified in the adult population have been observed in clinical trials of children and adolescent patients, the same warnings and precautions for adults should be considered for children and adolescents. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of adult patients in clinical trials for the approved indications of XARELTO (N=64,943 patients), 64 percent were 65 years and over, with 27 percent 75 years and over. In clinical trials the efficacy of XARELTO in the elderly (65 years or older) was similar to that seen in patients younger than 65 years. Both thrombotic and bleeding event rates were higher in these older patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment In pharmacokinetic studies, compared to healthy adult subjects with normal creatinine clearance, rivaroxaban exposure increased by approximately 44 to 64% in adult subjects with renal impairment. Increases in pharmacodynamic effects were also observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease not on Dialysis In the ROCKET AF trial, patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min were administered XARELTO 15 mg once daily resulting in serum concentrations of rivaroxaban and clinical outcomes similar to those in patients with better renal function administered XARELTO 20 mg once daily. Patients with CrCl <30 mL/min were not studied, but administration of XARELTO 15 mg once daily is expected to result in serum concentrations of rivaroxaban similar to those in patients with moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis Clinical efficacy and safety studies with XARELTO did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, administration of XARELTO 15 mg once daily will result in concentrations of rivaroxaban and pharmacodynamic activity similar to those observed in the ROCKET AF study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar stroke reduction and bleeding risk in patients with ESRD on dialysis as was seen in ROCKET AF. Treatment of DVT and/or PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and/or PE In the EINSTEIN trials, patients with CrCl values <30 mL/min at screening were excluded from the studies, but administration of XARELTO is expected to result in serum concentrations of rivaroxaban similar to those in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to <50 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in patients with CrCl 15 to <30 mL/min. Avoid the use of XARELTO in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min. Prophylaxis of DVT Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery The combined analysis of the RECORD 1–3 clinical efficacy studies did not show an increase in bleeding risk for patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min and reported a possible increase in total venous thromboemboli in this population. In the RECORD 1–3 trials, patients with CrCl values <30 mL/min at screening were excluded from the studies, but administration of XARELTO 10 mg once daily is expected to result in serum concentrations of rivaroxaban similar to those in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to <50 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in patients with CrCl 15 to <30 mL/min. Avoid the use of XARELTO in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min. Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Acutely Ill Medical Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications Not at High Risk of Bleeding Patients with CrCl values <30 mL/min at screening were excluded from the MAGELLAN study. In patients with CrCl <30 mL/min a dose of XARELTO 10 mg once daily is expected to result in serum concentrations of rivaroxaban similar to those in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to <50 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in patients with CrCl 15 to <30 mL/min. Avoid use of XARELTO in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min. Reduction of Risk of Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients with CAD and Reduction of Risk of Major Thrombotic Vascular Events in Patients with PAD, Including Patients After Recent Lower Extremity Revascularization due to Symptomatic PAD Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease not on Dialysis Patients with a CrCl <15 mL/min at screening were excluded from COMPASS and VOYAGER, and limited data are available for patients with a CrCl of 15 to 30 mL/min. In patients with CrCl <30 mL/min, a dose of 2.5 mg XARELTO twice daily is expected to give an exposure similar to that in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to <50 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , whose efficacy and safety outcomes were similar to those with preserved renal function. Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis No clinical outcome data is available for the use of XARELTO with aspirin in patients with ESRD on dialysis since these patients were not enrolled in COMPASS or VOYAGER. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, administration of XARELTO 2.5 mg twice daily will result in concentrations of rivaroxaban and pharmacodynamic activity similar to those observed in moderate renal impaired patients in the COMPASS study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , 12.3) ] . It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar CV risk reduction and bleeding risk in patients with ESRD on dialysis as was seen in COMPASS. Pediatric Use No dosage adjustment is required in patients 1 year of age or older with mild renal impairment (eGFR 50 to ≤ 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). There are limited clinical data in pediatric patients 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ); therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients. There are no clinical data in pediatric patients younger than 1 year with serum creatinine results above 97.5 th percentile; therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In a pharmacokinetic study, compared to healthy adult subjects with normal liver function, AUC increases of 127% were observed in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). The safety or PK of XARELTO in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) has not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid the use of XARELTO in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment or with any hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy. No clinical data are available in pediatric patients with hepatic impairment."

      "pregnancy": [
        "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data on XARELTO in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Use XARELTO with caution in pregnant patients because of the potential for pregnancy related hemorrhage and/or emergent delivery. The anticoagulant effect of XARELTO cannot be reliably monitored with standard laboratory testing. Consider the benefits and risks of XARELTO for the mother and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing XARELTO to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.7) ] . Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Pregnancy is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and that risk is increased in women with inherited or acquired thrombophilias. Pregnant women with thromboembolic disease have an increased risk of maternal complications including pre-eclampsia. Maternal thromboembolic disease increases the risk for intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption and early and late pregnancy loss. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Based on the pharmacologic activity of Factor Xa inhibitors and the potential to cross the placenta, bleeding may occur at any site in the fetus and/or neonate. Labor or Delivery All patients receiving anticoagulants, including pregnant women, are at risk for bleeding and this risk may be increased during labor or delivery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. The risk of bleeding should be balanced with the risk of thrombotic events when considering the use of XARELTO in this setting. Data Human Data There are no adequate or well-controlled studies of XARELTO in pregnant women, and dosing for pregnant women has not been established. Post-marketing experience is currently insufficient to determine a rivaroxaban-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. In an in vitro placenta perfusion model, unbound rivaroxaban was rapidly transferred across the human placenta. Animal Data Rivaroxaban crosses the placenta in animals. Rivaroxaban increased fetal toxicity (increased resorptions, decreased number of live fetuses, and decreased fetal body weight) when pregnant rabbits were given oral doses of ≥10 mg/kg rivaroxaban during the period of organogenesis. This dose corresponds to about 4 times the human exposure of unbound drug, based on AUC comparisons at the highest recommended human dose of 20 mg/day. Fetal body weights decreased when pregnant rats were given oral doses of 120 mg/kg during the period of organogenesis. This dose corresponds to about 14 times the human exposure of unbound drug. In rats, peripartal maternal bleeding and maternal and fetal death occurred at the rivaroxaban dose of 40 mg/kg (about 6 times maximum human exposure of the unbound drug at the human dose of 20 mg/day)."

XARELTO was not studied and therefore dosing cannot be reliably determined or recommended in children less than 6 months who were less than 37 weeks of gestation at birth; had less than 10 days of oral feeding, or had a body weight of less than 2.6 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.8) ] . The safety and effectiveness of XARELTO have been established for use in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with congenital heart disease who have undergone the Fontan procedure.

Clinical studies that evaluated safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data support the use of XARELTO 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg tablets in pediatric patients. For the XARELTO 2.5 mg tablets, there are no safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to support the use in pediatric patients. Therefore, XARELTO 2.5 mg tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

      "clinical_pharmacology": [
        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action XARELTO is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require a cofactor (such as Anti-thrombin III) for activity. Rivaroxaban inhibits free FXa and prothrombinase activity. Rivaroxaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, rivaroxaban decreases thrombin generation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Rivaroxaban produces dose-dependent inhibition of FXa activity. Clotting tests, such as prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest ® , are also prolonged dose-dependently. In children treated with rivaroxaban, the correlation between anti-factor Xa to plasma concentrations is linear with a slope close to 1. Monitoring for anticoagulation effect of rivaroxaban using anti-FXa activity or a clotting test is not recommended. Specific Populations Renal Impairment The relationship between systemic exposure and pharmacodynamic activity of rivaroxaban was altered in adult subjects with renal impairment relative to healthy control subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Table 18: Percentage Increase in Rivaroxaban PK and PD Measures in Adult Subjects with Renal Impairment Relative to Healthy Subjects from Clinical Pharmacology Studies Measure Parameter Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) 50–79 30–49 15–29 ESRD (on dialysis) Separate stand-alone study.

There is no clear understanding of the impact of hepatic impairment beyond this degree on the coagulation cascade and its relationship to efficacy and safety. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of rivaroxaban is dose-dependent. For the 2.5 mg and 10 mg dose, it is estimated to be 80% to 100% and is not affected by food. XARELTO 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be taken with or without food. XARELTO 20 mg administered in the fasted state has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 66%. Coadministration of XARELTO with food increases the bioavailability of the 20 mg dose (mean AUC and C max increasing by 39% and 76% respectively with food). XARELTO 15 mg and 20 mg tablets should be taken with food [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . The maximum concentrations (C max ) of rivaroxaban appear 2 to 4 hours after tablet intake. The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were not affected by drugs altering gastric pH. Coadministration of XARELTO (30 mg single dose) with the H 2 -receptor antagonist ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), the antacid aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (10 mL) or XARELTO (20 mg single dose) with the PPI omeprazole (40 mg once daily) did not show an effect on the bioavailability and exposure of rivaroxaban (see Figure 3 ). Absorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of drug release in the GI tract. A 29% and 56% decrease in AUC and C max compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is released in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when drug is released in the distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Avoid administration of rivaroxaban distal to the stomach which can result in reduced absorption and related drug exposure. In a study with 44 healthy subjects, both mean AUC and C max values for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a crushed tablet mixed in applesauce were comparable to that after the whole tablet. However, for the crushed tablet suspended in water and administered via an NG tube followed by a liquid meal, only mean AUC was comparable to that after the whole tablet, and C max was 18% lower. Distribution Protein binding of rivaroxaban in human plasma is approximately 92% to 95%, with albumin being the main binding component. The steady-state volume of distribution in healthy subjects is approximately 50 L. Metabolism Approximately 51% of an orally administered [ 14 C]-rivaroxaban dose was recovered as inactive metabolites in urine (30%) and feces (21%). Oxidative degradation catalyzed by CYP3A4/5 and CYP2J2 and hydrolysis are the major sites of biotransformation. Unchanged rivaroxaban was the predominant moiety in plasma with no major or active circulating metabolites. Excretion In a Phase 1 study, following the administration of [ 14 C]-rivaroxaban, approximately one-third (36%) was recovered as unchanged drug in the urine and 7% was recovered as unchanged drug in feces. Unchanged drug is excreted into urine, mainly via active tubular secretion and to a lesser extent via glomerular filtration (approximate 5:1 ratio). Rivaroxaban is a substrate of the efflux transporter proteins P-gp and ABCG2 (also abbreviated BCRP). Rivaroxaban's affinity for influx transporter proteins is unknown. Rivaroxaban is a low-clearance drug, with a systemic clearance of approximately 10 L/hr in healthy volunteers following intravenous administration. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years. Specific Populations The effects of level of renal impairment, age, body weight, and level of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban are summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: Effect of Specific Adult Populations on the Pharmacokinetics of Rivaroxaban [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] Figure 2 Gender Gender did not influence the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of XARELTO. Race Healthy Japanese subjects were found to have 20 to 40% on average higher exposures compared to other ethnicities including Chinese. However, these differences in exposure are reduced when values are corrected for body weight. Elderly The terminal elimination half-life is 11 to 13 hours in the elderly subjects aged 60 to 76 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Patients The rate and extent of absorption were similar between the tablet and suspension. After repeated administration of rivaroxaban for the treatment of VTE, the C max of rivaroxaban in plasma was observed at median times of 1.5 to 2.2 hours in subjects who ranged from birth to less than 18 years of age. In children who were 6 months to 9 years of age, in vitro plasma protein binding of rivaroxaban is approximately 90%. The half-life of rivaroxaban in plasma of pediatric patients treated for VTE decreased with decreasing age. Mean half-life values were 4.2 hours in adolescents, 3 hours in children 2 to 12 years of age, 1.9 hours in children 0.5 to <2 years of age, and 1.6 hours in children <0.5 years of age. An exploratory analysis in pediatric patients treated for VTE did not reveal relevant differences in rivaroxaban exposure based on gender or race. Hemodialysis in ESRD subjects: Systemic exposure to rivaroxaban administered as a single 15 mg dose in ESRD subjects dosed 3 hours after the completion of a 4-hour hemodialysis session (post-dialysis) is 56% higher when compared to subjects with normal renal function (see Table 18 ). The systemic exposure to rivaroxaban administered 2 hours prior to a 4-hour hemodialysis session with a dialysate flow rate of 600 mL/min and a blood flow rate in the range of 320 to 400 mL/min is 47% higher compared to those with normal renal function. The extent of the increase is similar to the increase in patients with CrCl 15 to 50 mL/min taking XARELTO 15 mg. Hemodialysis had no significant impact on rivaroxaban exposure. Protein binding was similar (86% to 89%) in healthy controls and ESRD subjects in this study. Pediatric Patients: Limited clinical data are available in children 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or in children younger than 1 year with serum creatinine results above 97.5th percentile [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of single-dose XARELTO (10 mg) were evaluated in a study in healthy subjects [CrCl ≥80 mL/min (n=8)] and in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment (see Figure 2 ). Compared to healthy subjects with normal creatinine clearance, rivaroxaban exposure increased in subjects with renal impairment. Increases in pharmacodynamic effects were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Hepatic Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of single-dose XARELTO (10 mg) were evaluated in a study in healthy adult subjects (n=16) and adult subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (see Figure 2 ). No patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) were studied. Compared to healthy subjects with normal liver function, significant increases in rivaroxaban exposure were observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) (see Figure 2 ). Increases in pharmacodynamic effects were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . No clinical data are available in pediatric patients with hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions In vitro studies indicate that rivaroxaban neither inhibits the major cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2J2, and 3A nor induces CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C19, or 3A. In vitro data also indicates a low rivaroxaban inhibitory potential for P-gp and ABCG2 transporters. The effects of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban exposure are summarized in Figure 3 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Figure 3: Effect of Coadministered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Rivaroxaban in Adults Figure 3 Anticoagulants In a drug interaction study, single doses of enoxaparin (40 mg subcutaneous) and XARELTO (10 mg) given concomitantly resulted in an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity. In another study, single doses of warfarin (15 mg) and XARELTO (5 mg) resulted in an additive effect on factor Xa inhibition and PT. Neither enoxaparin nor warfarin affected the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban (see Figure 3 ). NSAIDs/Aspirin In ROCKET AF, concomitant aspirin use (almost exclusively at a dose of 100 mg or less) during the double-blind phase was identified as an independent risk factor for major bleeding. NSAIDs are known to increase bleeding, and bleeding risk may be increased when NSAIDs are used concomitantly with XARELTO. Neither naproxen nor aspirin affected the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban (see Figure 3 ). Clopidogrel In two drug interaction studies where clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily maintenance dose) and XARELTO (15 mg single dose) were coadministered in healthy subjects, an increase in bleeding time to 45 minutes was observed in approximately 45% and 30% of subjects in these studies, respectively. The change in bleeding time was approximately twice the maximum increase seen with either drug alone. There was no change in the pharmacokinetics of either drug. Drug-Disease Interactions with Drugs that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems In a pharmacokinetic trial, XARELTO was administered as a single dose in subjects with mild (CrCl = 50 to 79 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCl = 30 to 49 mL/min) receiving multiple doses of erythromycin (a combined P-gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitor). Compared to XARELTO administered alone in subjects with normal renal function (CrCl >80 mL/min), subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment concomitantly receiving erythromycin reported a 76% and 99% increase in AUC inf and a 56% and 64% increase in C max , respectively. Similar trends in pharmacodynamic effects were also observed. 12.6 QT/QTc Prolongation In a thorough QT study in healthy men and women aged 50 years and older, no QTc prolonging effects were observed for XARELTO (15 mg and 45 mg, single-dose)."

Coadministration of XARELTO (30 mg single dose) with the H 2 -receptor antagonist ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), the antacid aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (10 mL) or XARELTO (20 mg single dose) with the PPI omeprazole (40 mg once daily) did not show an effect on the bioavailability and exposure of rivaroxaban (see Figure 3 ). Absorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of drug release in the GI tract. A 29% and 56% decrease in AUC and C max compared to tablet was reported when rivaroxaban granulate is released in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when drug is released in the distal small intestine, or ascending colon. Avoid administration of rivaroxaban distal to the stomach which can result in reduced absorption and related drug exposure. In a study with 44 healthy subjects, both mean AUC and C max values for 20 mg rivaroxaban administered orally as a crushed tablet mixed in applesauce were comparable to that after the whole tablet. However, for the crushed tablet suspended in water and administered via an NG tube followed by a liquid meal, only mean AUC was comparable to that after the whole tablet, and C max was 18% lower. Distribution Protein binding of rivaroxaban in human plasma is approximately 92% to 95%, with albumin being the main binding component. The steady-state volume of distribution in healthy subjects is approximately 50 L. Metabolism Approximately 51% of an orally administered [ 14 C]-rivaroxaban dose was recovered as inactive metabolites in urine (30%) and feces (21%). Oxidative degradation catalyzed by CYP3A4/5 and CYP2J2 and hydrolysis are the major sites of biotransformation. Unchanged rivaroxaban was the predominant moiety in plasma with no major or active circulating metabolites. Excretion In a Phase 1 study, following the administration of [ 14 C]-rivaroxaban, approximately one-third (36%) was recovered as unchanged drug in the urine and 7% was recovered as unchanged drug in feces. Unchanged drug is excreted into urine, mainly via active tubular secretion and to a lesser extent via glomerular filtration (approximate 5:1 ratio). Rivaroxaban is a substrate of the efflux transporter proteins P-gp and ABCG2 (also abbreviated BCRP). Rivaroxaban's affinity for influx transporter proteins is unknown. Rivaroxaban is a low-clearance drug, with a systemic clearance of approximately 10 L/hr in healthy volunteers following intravenous administration. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years. Specific Populations The effects of level of renal impairment, age, body weight, and level of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban are summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2: Effect of Specific Adult Populations on the Pharmacokinetics of Rivaroxaban [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] Figure 2 Gender Gender did not influence the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of XARELTO. Race Healthy Japanese subjects were found to have 20 to 40% on average higher exposures compared to other ethnicities including Chinese. However, these differences in exposure are reduced when values are corrected for body weight. Elderly The terminal elimination half-life is 11 to 13 hours in the elderly subjects aged 60 to 76 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Patients The rate and extent of absorption were similar between the tablet and suspension. After repeated administration of rivaroxaban for the treatment of VTE, the C max of rivaroxaban in plasma was observed at median times of 1.5 to 2.2 hours in subjects who ranged from birth to less than 18 years of age. In children who were 6 months to 9 years of age, in vitro plasma protein binding of rivaroxaban is approximately 90%. The half-life of rivaroxaban in plasma of pediatric patients treated for VTE decreased with decreasing age. Mean half-life values were 4.2 hours in adolescents, 3 hours in children 2 to 12 years of age, 1.9 hours in children 0.5 to <2 years of age, and 1.6 hours in children <0.5 years of age. An exploratory analysis in pediatric patients treated for VTE did not reveal relevant differences in rivaroxaban exposure based on gender or race. Hemodialysis in ESRD subjects: Systemic exposure to rivaroxaban administered as a single 15 mg dose in ESRD subjects dosed 3 hours after the completion of a 4-hour hemodialysis session (post-dialysis) is 56% higher when compared to subjects with normal renal function (see Table 18 ). The systemic exposure to rivaroxaban administered 2 hours prior to a 4-hour hemodialysis session with a dialysate flow rate of 600 mL/min and a blood flow rate in the range of 320 to 400 mL/min is 47% higher compared to those with normal renal function. The extent of the increase is similar to the increase in patients with CrCl 15 to 50 mL/min taking XARELTO 15 mg. Hemodialysis had no significant impact on rivaroxaban exposure. Protein binding was similar (86% to 89%) in healthy controls and ESRD subjects in this study. Pediatric Patients: Limited clinical data are available in children 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or in children younger than 1 year with serum creatinine results above 97.5th percentile [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Renal Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of single-dose XARELTO (10 mg) were evaluated in a study in healthy subjects [CrCl ≥80 mL/min (n=8)] and in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment (see Figure 2 ). Compared to healthy subjects with normal creatinine clearance, rivaroxaban exposure increased in subjects with renal impairment. Increases in pharmacodynamic effects were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Hepatic Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of single-dose XARELTO (10 mg) were evaluated in a study in healthy adult subjects (n=16) and adult subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (see Figure 2 ). No patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) were studied. Compared to healthy subjects with normal liver function, significant increases in rivaroxaban exposure were observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) (see Figure 2 ). Increases in pharmacodynamic effects were also observed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . No clinical data are available in pediatric patients with hepatic impairment. Drug Interactions In vitro studies indicate that rivaroxaban neither inhibits the major cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2J2, and 3A nor induces CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C19, or 3A. In vitro data also indicates a low rivaroxaban inhibitory potential for P-gp and ABCG2 transporters. The effects of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban exposure are summarized in Figure 3 [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Figure 3: Effect of Coadministered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Rivaroxaban in Adults Figure 3 Anticoagulants In a drug interaction study, single doses of enoxaparin (40 mg subcutaneous) and XARELTO (10 mg) given concomitantly resulted in an additive effect on anti-factor Xa activity. In another study, single doses of warfarin (15 mg) and XARELTO (5 mg) resulted in an additive effect on factor Xa inhibition and PT. Neither enoxaparin nor warfarin affected the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban (see Figure 3 ). NSAIDs/Aspirin In ROCKET AF, concomitant aspirin use (almost exclusively at a dose of 100 mg or less) during the double-blind phase was identified as an independent risk factor for major bleeding. NSAIDs are known to increase bleeding, and bleeding risk may be increased when NSAIDs are used concomitantly with XARELTO. Neither naproxen nor aspirin affected the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban (see Figure 3 ). Clopidogrel In two drug interaction studies where clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily maintenance dose) and XARELTO (15 mg single dose) were coadministered in healthy subjects, an increase in bleeding time to 45 minutes was observed in approximately 45% and 30% of subjects in these studies, respectively. The change in bleeding time was approximately twice the maximum increase seen with either drug alone. There was no change in the pharmacokinetics of either drug. Drug-Disease Interactions with Drugs that Inhibit Cytochrome P450 3A Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems In a pharmacokinetic trial, XARELTO was administered as a single dose in subjects with mild (CrCl = 50 to 79 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCl = 30 to 49 mL/min) receiving multiple doses of erythromycin (a combined P-gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitor). Compared to XARELTO administered alone in subjects with normal renal function (CrCl >80 mL/min), subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment concomitantly receiving erythromycin reported a 76% and 99% increase in AUC inf and a 56% and 64% increase in C max , respectively. Similar trends in pharmacodynamic effects were also observed."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Stroke Prevention in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation The evidence for the efficacy and safety of XARELTO was derived from R ivaroxaban O nce-daily oral direct factor Xa inhibition C ompared with vitamin K antagonist for the prevention of stroke and E mbolism T rial in A trial F ibrillation (ROCKET AF) [NCT00403767], a multi-national, double-blind study comparing XARELTO (at a dose of 20 mg once daily with the evening meal in patients with CrCl >50 mL/min and 15 mg once daily with the evening meal in patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min) to warfarin (titrated to INR 2.0 to 3.0) to reduce the risk of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients had to have one or more of the following additional risk factors for stroke: a prior stroke (ischemic or unknown type), transient ischemic attack (TIA) or non-CNS systemic embolism, or 2 or more of the following risk factors: age ≥75 years, hypertension, heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, or diabetes mellitus ROCKET AF was a non-inferiority study designed to demonstrate that XARELTO preserved more than 50% of warfarin's effect on stroke and non-CNS systemic embolism as established by previous placebo-controlled studies of warfarin in atrial fibrillation. A total of 14264 patients were randomized and followed on study treatment for a median of 590 days. The mean age was 71 years and the mean CHADS 2 score was 3.5. The population was 60% male, 83% Caucasian, 13% Asian and 1.3% Black. There was a history of stroke, TIA, or non-CNS systemic embolism in 55% of patients, and 38% of patients had not taken a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) within 6 weeks at time of screening. Concomitant diseases of patients in this study included hypertension 91%, diabetes 40%, congestive heart failure 63%, and prior myocardial infarction 17%. At baseline, 37% of patients were on aspirin (almost exclusively at a dose of 100 mg or less) and few patients were on clopidogrel. Patients were enrolled in Eastern Europe (39%); North America (19%); Asia, Australia, and New Zealand (15%); Western Europe (15%); and Latin America (13%). Patients randomized to warfarin had a mean percentage of time in the INR target range of 2.0 to 3.0 of 55%, lower during the first few months of the study. In ROCKET AF, XARELTO was demonstrated non-inferior to warfarin for the primary composite endpoint of time to first occurrence of stroke (any type) or non-CNS systemic embolism [HR (95% CI): 0.88 (0.74, 1.03)], but superiority to warfarin was not demonstrated. There is insufficient experience to determine how XARELTO and warfarin compare when warfarin therapy is well-controlled. Table 19 displays the overall results for the primary composite endpoint and its components.

Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and all of which were pre-specified (diabetic status was not pre-specified in the subgroup, but was a criterion for the CHADS2 score). The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Figure 5: Risk of Stroke or Non-CNS Systemic Embolism by Baseline Characteristics in ROCKET AF Data are shown for all randomized patients followed to site notification that the study would end. (Intent-to-Treat Population) The efficacy of XARELTO was generally consistent across major subgroups. The protocol for ROCKET AF did not stipulate anticoagulation after study drug discontinuation, but warfarin patients who completed the study were generally maintained on warfarin. XARELTO patients were generally switched to warfarin without a period of coadministration of warfarin and XARELTO, so that they were not adequately anticoagulated after stopping XARELTO until attaining a therapeutic INR. During the 28 days following the end of the study, there were 22 strokes in the 4637 patients taking XARELTO vs. 6 in the 4691 patients taking warfarin. Few patients in ROCKET AF underwent electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. The utility of XARELTO for preventing post-cardioversion stroke and systemic embolism is unknown. Figure 4 Figure 5 14.2 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and/or Pulmonary Embolism (PE) EINSTEIN Deep Vein Thrombosis and EINSTEIN Pulmonary Embolism Studies XARELTO for the treatment of DVT and/or PE was studied in EINSTEIN DVT [NCT00440193] and EINSTEIN PE [NCT00439777], multi-national, open-label, non-inferiority studies comparing XARELTO (at an initial dose of 15 mg twice daily with food for the first three weeks, followed by XARELTO 20 mg once daily with food) to enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily for at least five days with VKA and then continued with VKA only after the target INR (2.0–3.0) was reached. Patients who required thrombectomy, insertion of a caval filter, or use of a fibrinolytic agent and patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, significant liver disease, or active bleeding were excluded from the studies. The intended treatment duration was 3, 6, or 12 months based on investigator's assessment prior to randomization. A total of 8281 (3449 in EINSTEIN DVT and 4832 in EINSTEIN PE) patients were randomized and followed on study treatment for a mean of 208 days in the XARELTO group and 204 days in the enoxaparin/VKA group. The mean age was approximately 57 years. The population was 55% male, 70% Caucasian, 9% Asian and about 3% Black. About 73% and 92% of XARELTO-treated patients in the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies, respectively, received initial parenteral anticoagulant treatment for a median duration of 2 days. Enoxaparin/VKA-treated patients in the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies received initial parenteral anticoagulant treatment for a median duration of 8 days. Aspirin was taken as on treatment concomitant antithrombotic medication by approximately 12% of patients in both treatment groups. Patients randomized to VKA had an unadjusted mean percentage of time in the INR target range of 2.0 to 3.0 of 58% in EINSTEIN DVT study and 60% in EINSTEIN PE study, with the lower values occurring during the first month of the study. In the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies, 49% of patients had an idiopathic DVT/PE at baseline. Other risk factors included previous episode of DVT/PE (19%), recent surgery or trauma (18%), immobilization (16%), use of estrogen-containing drug (8%), known thrombophilic conditions (6%), or active cancer (5%). In the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies, XARELTO was demonstrated to be non-inferior to enoxaparin/VKA for the primary composite endpoint of time to first occurrence of recurrent DVT or non-fatal or fatal PE [EINSTEIN DVT HR (95% CI): 0.68 (0.44, 1.04); EINSTEIN PE HR (95% CI): 1.12 (0.75, 1.68)]. In each study the conclusion of non-inferiority was based on the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio being less than 2.0. Table 20 displays the overall results for the primary composite endpoint and its components for EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies.

The intended treatment duration in the study was up to 12 months. Patients with an indication for continued therapeutic-dose anticoagulation were excluded. Because the benefit-risk assessment favored the 10 mg dose versus aspirin compared to the 20 mg dose versus aspirin, only the data concerning the 10 mg dose is discussed below. A total of 2275 patients were randomized and followed on study treatment for a mean of 290 days for the XARELTO and aspirin treatment groups. The mean age was approximately 59 years. The population was 56% male, 70% Caucasian, 14% Asian and 3% Black. In the EINSTEIN CHOICE study, 51% of patients had DVT only, 33% had PE only, and 16% had PE and DVT combined. Other risk factors included idiopathic VTE (43%), previous episode of DVT/PE (17%), recent surgery or trauma (12%), prolonged immobilization (10%), use of estrogen containing drugs (5%), known thrombophilic conditions (6%), Factor V Leiden gene mutation (4%), or active cancer (3%). In the EINSTEIN CHOICE study, XARELTO 10 mg was demonstrated to be superior to aspirin 100 mg for the primary composite endpoint of time to first occurrence of recurrent DVT or non-fatal or fatal PE.

The two randomized, double-blind, clinical studies (RECORD 1 and 2) in patients undergoing elective total hip replacement surgery compared XARELTO 10 mg once daily starting at least 6 to 8 hours (about 90% of patients dosed 6 to 10 hours) after wound closure versus enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hours preoperatively. In RECORD 1 and 2, a total of 6727 patients were randomized and 6579 received study drug. The mean age [± standard deviation (SD)] was 63 ± 12.2 (range 18 to 93) years with 49% of patients ≥65 years and 55% of patients were female. More than 82% of patients were White, 7% were Asian, and less than 2% were Black. The studies excluded patients undergoing staged bilateral total hip replacement, patients with severe renal impairment defined as an estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, or patients with significant liver disease (hepatitis or cirrhosis). In RECORD 1, the mean exposure duration (± SD) to active XARELTO and enoxaparin was 33.3 ± 7.0 and 33.6 ± 8.3 days, respectively. In RECORD 2, the mean exposure duration to active XARELTO and enoxaparin was 33.5 ± 6.9 and 12.4 ± 2.9 days, respectively. After Day 13, oral placebo was continued in the enoxaparin group for the remainder of the double-blind study duration. The efficacy data for RECORD 1 and 2 are provided in Table 22.

The study excluded patients with severe renal impairment defined as an estimated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min or patients with significant liver disease (hepatitis or cirrhosis). The mean exposure duration (± SD) to active XARELTO and enoxaparin was 11.9 ± 2.3 and 12.5 ± 3.0 days, respectively. The efficacy data are provided in Table 23.

MAGELLAN was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group efficacy and safety study comparing XARELTO to enoxaparin, in the prevention of VTE in hospitalized acutely ill medical patients during the in-hospital and post-hospital discharge period. Eligible patients included adults who were at least 40 years of age, hospitalized for an acute medical illness, at risk of VTE due to moderate or severe immobility, and had additional risk factors for VTE. The population at risk of VTE was required to have one or more of the following VTE risk factors, i.e. prolonged immobilization, age ≥75 years, history of cancer, history of VTE, history of heart failure, thrombophilia, acute infectious disease contributing to the hospitalization and BMI ≥35 kg/m 2 ). The causes for hospitalization included heart failure, active cancer, acute ischemic stroke, acute infectious and inflammatory disease and acute respiratory insufficiency. Patients were randomized to receive either XARELTO 10 mg once daily for 35 ±4 days starting in hospital and continuing post hospital discharge (n=4050) or enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for 10 ±4 days starting in hospital followed by placebo post-discharge (n=4051). The major efficacy outcome in the MAGELLAN trial was a composite endpoint that included asymptomatic proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in lower extremity, symptomatic proximal or distal DVT in the lower extremity, symptomatic non-fatal pulmonary embolism (PE), and death related to venous thromboembolism (VTE). A total of 6024 patients were evaluable for the major efficacy outcome analysis (2967 on XARELTO 10 mg once daily and 3057 on enoxaparin/placebo). The mean age was 68.9 years, with 37.1% of the subject population ≥ 75 years. VTE risk factors included severe immobilization at study entry (99.9%), D-dimer > 2× ULN (43.7%), history of heart failure (35.6%), BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 (15.2%), chronic venous insufficiency (14.9%), acute infectious disease (13.9%), severe varicosis (12.5%), history of cancer (16.2%), history of VTE (4.5%), hormone replacement therapy (1.1%), and thrombophilia (0.3%), recent major surgery (0.8%) and recent serious trauma (0.2%). The population was 54.7% male, 68.2% White, 20.4% Asian, 1.9% Black and 5.3% Other. Admitting diagnoses for hospitalization were acute infectious diseases (43.8%) followed by congestive heart failure NYHA class III or IV (33.2%), acute respiratory insufficiency (26.4%), acute ischemic stroke (18.5%) and acute inflammatory diseases (3.4%). Table 24 shows the overall results from the prespecified, modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis for the efficacy outcomes and their components. This analysis excludes approximately 25% of the patients mainly due to no ultrasonographic assessment (13.5%), inadequate assessment at day 35 (8.1%), or lack of intake of study medication (1.3%).

Therefore, patients meeting these criteria were excluded from the following analyses presented below. Table 25 provides the efficacy results for the subgroup of patients not at a high risk of bleeding.

A total of 27,395 patients were evenly randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg once daily, rivaroxaban 5 mg orally twice daily alone, or aspirin 100 mg once daily alone. Because the 5 mg dose alone was not superior to aspirin alone, only the data concerning the 2.5 mg dose plus aspirin are discussed below. Patients with established CAD or PAD were eligible. Patients with CAD who were younger than 65 years of age were also required to have documentation of atherosclerosis involving at least two vascular beds or to have at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors (current smoking, diabetes mellitus, an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 mL per minute, heart failure, or non-lacunar ischemic stroke ≥1 month earlier). Patients with PAD were either symptomatic with ankle brachial index <0.90 or had asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis ≥50%, a previous carotid revascularization procedure, or established ischemic disease of one or both lower extremities. Patients were excluded for use of dual antiplatelet, other non-aspirin antiplatelet, or oral anticoagulant therapies, ischemic, non-lacunar stroke within 1 month, hemorrhagic or lacunar stroke at any time, or eGFR <15 mL/min. The mean age was 68 years and 21% of the subject population were ≥75 years. Of the included patients, 91% had CAD (and will be referred to as the COMPASS CAD population), 27% had PAD (and will be referred to as the COMPASS PAD population), and 18% had both CAD and PAD. Of the patients with CAD, 69% had prior MI, 60% had prior percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)/atherectomy/ percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and 26% had history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) prior to study. Of the patients with PAD, 49% had intermittent claudication, 27% had peripheral artery bypass surgery or peripheral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, 26% had asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis > 50%, and 4% had limb or foot amputation for arterial vascular disease. The mean duration of follow-up was 23 months. Relative to placebo, XARELTO reduced the rate of the primary composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death: HR 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.86; p=0.00004). In the COMPASS CAD population, the benefit was observed early with a constant treatment effect over the entire treatment period (see Table 26 and Figure 10 ). A benefit-risk analysis of the data from COMPASS was performed by comparing the number of CV events (CV deaths, myocardial infarctions and non-hemorrhagic strokes) prevented to the number of fatal or life-threatening bleeding events (fatal bleeds + symptomatic non-fatal bleeds into a critical organ) in the XARELTO group versus the placebo group. Compared to placebo, during 10,000 patient-years of treatment, XARELTO would be expected to result in 70 fewer CV events and 12 additional life-threatening bleeds, indicating a favorable balance of benefits and risks. The results in the COMPASS CAD population were consistent across major subgroups (see Figure 9 ).

Figure 9 Figure 10 14.7 Reduction of Risk of Major Thrombotic Vascular Events in Patients with PAD, Including Patients after Lower Extremity Revascularization due to Symptomatic PAD The efficacy and safety of XARELTO 2.5 mg orally twice daily versus placebo on a background of aspirin 100 mg once daily in patients with PAD were evaluated in the COMPASS study (n=4996) and will be referred to as the COMPASS PAD population [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . The efficacy and safety of XARELTO were also evaluated for the reduction in the risk of the composite endpoint of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular death, acute limb ischemia (ALI), and major amputation of a vascular etiology in patients undergoing a lower extremity infrainguinal revascularization procedure due to symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the double-blinded, placebo-controlled V ascular O utcomes stud Y of A SA alon G with rivaroxaban in E ndovascular or surgical limb R evascularization for peripheral artery disease (PAD) trial (VOYAGER) [NCT02504216]. A total of 6,564 patients were equally randomized to XARELTO 2.5 mg orally twice daily vs placebo on a background therapy of aspirin 100 mg once daily. Eligible patients included adults who were at least 50 years of age with documented moderate to severe symptomatic lower extremity atherosclerotic PAD who had a successful peripheral surgical procedure and/or endovascular procedure with or without clopidogrel (up to a maximum of 6 months was allowed; median duration of therapy was 31 days). Patients had either a prior history of limb revascularization with ankle brachial index ≤0.85 or no prior history of limb revascularization with ankle brachial index ≤0.80. Patients in need of dual antiplatelet for >6 months, or any additional antiplatelet other than aspirin and clopidogrel, or oral anticoagulant, as well as patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA), or patients with eGFR <15 mL/min were excluded. The mean age was 67 years and 20% of the subject population was ≥75 years. Of the included patients, 35% had surgical revascularization, 47% had endovascular revascularization with clopidogrel, and 18% endovascular revascularization without clopidogrel. The median duration of follow-up was 30.8 months. XARELTO 2.5 mg twice daily was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary composite outcome of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular death, acute limb ischemia (ALI), and major amputation of a vascular etiology. The primary efficacy outcome and its components are provided in Table 27. The Kaplan-Meier plot for the primary efficacy outcome can be seen in Figure 11. The secondary efficacy outcomes were tested for superiority in a prespecified, hierarchical order and the first five of seven endpoints were significantly reduced in the rivaroxaban treatment arm (see Table 27 ). Compared to placebo during 10,000 patient-years of treatment, XARELTO would be expected to result in 181 fewer primary outcome events and 29 more TIMI major bleeding events, indicating a favorable balance of benefits and risks. Figure 11: Time to First Occurrence of Primary Efficacy Outcome (Myocardial Infarction, Ischemic Stroke, Cardiovascular Death, Acute Limb Ischemia, Major Amputation due to Vascular Origins) in VOYAGER All patients received aspirin 100 mg once daily as background therapy. Figure 12 shows the risk of primary efficacy outcome across major subgroups. Subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. The primary efficacy endpoint generally shows homogeneous results across subgroups.

There were 276 children aged 12 to <18 years, 101 children aged 6 to <12 years, 69 children aged 2 to <6 years, and 54 children aged <2 years. Patients <6 months of age were excluded from enrollment if they were <37 weeks of gestation at birth, or had <10 days of oral feeding, or had a body weight of <2.6 kg. Index VTE was classified as either central venous catheter-related VTE (CVC-VTE), cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis (CVST), and all other VTE including DVT and PE (non-CVC-VTE). Patients received initial treatment with therapeutic dosages of unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux for at least 5 days, and were randomized 2:1 to receive either body weight-adjusted doses of XARELTO (exposures to match that of 20 mg daily dose in adults) or comparator group (UFH, LMWH, fondaparinux or VKA) for a main study treatment period of 3 months (or 1 month for children <2 years with CVC-VTE). A diagnostic imaging test was obtained at baseline and at the end of the main study treatment. When clinically necessary, treatment was extended up to 12 months in total (or up to 3 months in total for children <2 years with CVC-VTE). Table 28 displays the primary and secondary efficacy results.

Symptomatic recurrent VTE or major bleeding events occurred in 4 of 335 children (1.2%, 95% CI 0.4%, 3.0%) in the XARELTO group and 7 of 165 children (4.2%, 95% CI 2.0%, 8.4%) in the comparator group. 14.9 Thromboprophylaxis in Pediatric Patients with Congenital Heart Disease after the Fontan Procedure The efficacy and safety of XARELTO for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease who have undergone the Fontan procedure was evaluated in the UNIVERSE Phase 3 study [NCT02846532]. UNIVERSE was a prospective, open-label, active controlled, multicenter, 2-part study, designed to evaluate the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties of XARELTO (Part A), and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of XARELTO when used for thromboprophylaxis for 12 months compared with aspirin (Part B) in children 2 to 8 years of age with single ventricle physiology who had the Fontan procedure. Patients in Part B were randomized 2:1 to receive either body weight-adjusted doses of XARELTO (exposures to match that of 10 mg daily dose in adults) or aspirin (approximately 5 mg/kg). Patients with eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 were excluded. The median time between Fontan procedure and the first dose of XARELTO was 4 (range: 2–61) days in Part A and 34 (range: 2–124) days in part B. In comparison, the median time to initiating aspirin was 24 (range 2–117) days. Table 29 displays the primary efficacy results.

        "MEDICATION GUIDE XARELTO ® (zah-REL-toe) (rivaroxaban) tablets XARELTO ® (zah-REL-toe) (rivaroxaban) oral suspension This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Revised: 02/2023 What is the most important information I should know about XARELTO? XARELTO may cause serious side effects, including: Increased risk of blood clots if you stop taking XARELTO. People with atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heart beat) that is not caused by a heart valve problem (non-valvular) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood. Do not stop taking XARELTO without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO increases your risk of having a stroke. If you have to stop taking XARELTO, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming. Increased risk of bleeding. XARELTO can cause bleeding which can be serious and may lead to death. This is because XARELTO is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that lowers blood clotting. During treatment with XARELTO you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO and have certain other medical problems. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including: aspirin or aspirin containing products long-term (chronic) use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) warfarin sodium (Coumadin ® , Jantoven ® ) any medicine that contains heparin clopidogrel (Plavix ® ) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above. Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you or your child develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding: unexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as: nose bleeds that happen often unusual bleeding from the gums menstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal or vaginal bleeding bleeding that is severe or you cannot control red, pink or brown urine bright red or black stools (looks like tar) cough up blood or blood clots vomit blood or your vomit looks like \"coffee grounds\" headaches, feeling dizzy or weak pain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites Spinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma). People who take a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) like XARELTO, and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if: a thin tube called an epidural catheter is placed in your back to give you certain medicine you take NSAIDs or a medicine to prevent blood from clotting you have a history of difficult or repeated epidural or spinal punctures you have a history of problems with your spine or have had surgery on your spine If you take XARELTO and receive spinal anesthesia or have a spinal puncture, your doctor should watch you closely for symptoms of spinal or epidural blood clots. Tell your doctor right away if you have: back pain tingling numbness muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet) loss of control of the bowels or bladder (incontinence) XARELTO is not for use in people with artificial heart valves. XARELTO is not for use in people with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), especially with positive triple antibody testing. What is XARELTO? XARELTO is a prescription medicine used to: reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in adults who have a medical condition called atrial fibrillation that is not caused by a heart valve problem. With atrial fibrillation, part of the heart does not beat the way it should. This can lead to the formation of blood clots, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE) reduce the risk of blood clots from happening again in adults who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months. help prevent a blood clot in the legs and lungs of adults who have just had hip or knee replacement surgery. help prevent blood clots in certain adults hospitalized for an acute illness and after discharge who are at risk of getting blood clots because of the loss of or decreased ability to move around (mobility) and other risks for getting blood clots and who do not have a high risk of bleeding. XARELTO is used with low dose aspirin to: reduce the risk of serious heart problems, heart attack and stroke in adults with coronary artery disease (a condition where the blood supply to the heart is reduced or blocked). reduce the risk of a sudden decrease in blood flow to the legs, major amputation, serious heart problems or stroke in adults with peripheral artery disease (a condition where the blood flow to the legs is reduced) and includes adults who have recently had a procedure to improve blood flow to the legs. XARELTO is used in children to: treat blood clots or reduce the risk of blood clots from happening again in children from birth to less than 18 years, after receiving at least 5 days of treatment with injectable or intravenous medicines used to treat blood clots. help prevent blood clots in children 2 years and older with congenital heart disease after the Fontan procedure. XARELTO was not studied and is not recommended in children less than 6 months of age who: were less than 37 weeks of growth (gestation) at birth had less than 10 days of oral feeding, or had a body weight of less than 5.7 pounds (2.6 kg) Do not take XARELTO if you or your child: currently have certain types of abnormal bleeding. Talk to your doctor before taking XARELTO if you currently have unusual bleeding. are allergic to rivaroxaban or any of the ingredients in XARELTO. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in XARELTO.
